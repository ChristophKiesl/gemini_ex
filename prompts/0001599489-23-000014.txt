ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Veritiv Corporation ("Veritiv" or the "Company" and sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "we", "our" or "us") is a leading North American business-to-business full-service provider of value-added packaging products and services, as well as facility solutions and print-based products and services. Veritiv's focus on segment-tailored market leadership in distribution and a commitment to operational excellence allows it to partner with world class suppliers, add value through multiple capabilities and deliver solutions to a wide range of customer segments. See Item 7 of this report for additional information related to the Company's strategic initiatives.
Veritiv operates primarily throughout the United States ("U.S.") and Mexico, serving customers across a broad range of industry sectors. These sectors include manufacturing, food and beverage, wholesale and retail, healthcare, transportation, property management, higher education, entertainment and hospitality, commercial printing and publishing.
Veritiv's business is organized under three reportable segments: Packaging, Facility Solutions and Print Solutions. This segment structure is consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is Veritiv's Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the Company's business. The Company also has a Corporate & Other category which includes certain assets and costs not primarily attributable to any of the reportable segments. Prior to its divestiture in September 2022, the Company's logistics solutions business, which provided transportation and warehousing solutions, was also included in Corporate & Other. The following summary describes the products and services offered in each of the reportable segments: 
•Packaging – Veritiv is a global provider of packaging products, services and solutions. The Packaging segment provides custom and standard packaging solutions for customers based in North America and in key global markets. This segment services its customers with a full spectrum of packaging product materials within flexible, corrugated and fiber, ancillary packaging, rigid and equipment categories. The business is strategically focused on higher growth industry sectors including manufacturing, food and beverage, wholesale and retail, healthcare and transportation, as well as specialty sectors based on industry and product expertise. Veritiv's packaging professionals create customer value through supply chain solutions, structural and graphic packaging design and engineering, automation, workflow and equipment services and kitting.
•Facility Solutions – Veritiv is a global provider of hygiene and facility solutions products and services. The Facility Solutions segment sources and sells cleaning, break-room and other supplies in product categories that include towels and tissues, food service, personal protective equipment, cleaning chemicals and skincare, primarily in North America. Through this segment Veritiv manages a world class network of leading suppliers in most facilities solutions categories. Additionally, the Company offers total cost of ownership solutions with re-merchandising, budgeting and compliance reporting and inventory management. Its sales force is trained to bring leading vertical expertise to the major North American geographies.
•Print Solutions – The Print Solutions segment helps customers optimize their printed communication by sourcing and distributing sustainable papers through a global network of suppliers. The Print Solutions segment sells and distributes commercial printing, writing and copying products and services primarily in North America. Veritiv's broad geographic platform of operations and services, coupled with the breadth of paper and graphics products, including exclusive private brand offerings, provides a comprehensive suite of solutions in paper procurement, print management, supply chain and distribution. This segment's customer base includes commercial printers, marketers, corporate end users, publishers and retailers.
The table below summarizes net sales for each of the above reportable segments, as well as the Corporate & Other category, as a percentage of consolidated net sales:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Packaging | 55% | 55% | 52% 
Facility Solutions | 11% | 13% | 15% 
Print Solutions | 33% | 31% | 32% 
Corporate & Other | 1% | 1% | 1% 
Total Company | 100% | 100% | 100%

General Development of Business
Information related to developments in our business can be found in Item 7 of this report.
Products and Services
Veritiv distributes well-known national and regional brand products as well as products marketed under its own private label brands. Products under the Company's private label brands are manufactured by third-party suppliers in accordance with specifications established by the Company. Our portfolio of private label products includes:
•Packaging products under the TUFflex brand, which include stretch film, mailers, shrink film, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes;
•Foodservice disposable products, cleaning chemicals, towels and tissues, can liners, sanitary maintenance supplies and a wide range of facility supplies products under the Reliable, Spring Grove, Steel and PUR Value brands; and
•Coated and uncoated papers, coated board and cut size under the Endurance, Comet, Starbrite Opaque Select and other brands.
The table below summarizes sales of products sold under private label brands as a percentage of the respective reportable segment's or total Company's net sales:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Packaging | 6% | 6% | 6% 
Facility Solutions | 9% | 8% | 8% 
Print Solutions | 21% | 17% | 14% 
Total Company | 11% | 10% | 9% 

Customers
We serve customers across a broad range of industry sectors, through a variety of means ranging from multi-year sales agreements to individual transactional sales. For many of its largest customers, the Company enters into multi-year contracts that set forth the terms and conditions of sale including product pricing and incentive agreements, which are generally based on sales volume targets. The Company's customers are generally not required to purchase any minimum amount of products under these agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the Company's consolidated net sales. 
Suppliers
We purchase our products from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, across different business segments. Although varying by segment, the Company's suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label products and, to a more limited extent, independent regional and private label suppliers. Suppliers are selected based on customer demand for the product and a supplier's total service, cost and product quality offering. 
Our sourcing organization supports the purchasing of well-known national and regional brand products as well as products marketed under our own private label brands from key national suppliers in the packaging, facility solutions and print industries. A portion of the Print Solutions segment operates as a direct ship business aligned with the Company's core supplier strategy. In addition, under the guidance and oversight of the sourcing team, our merchandising personnel source products not available within our core offering in order to meet specialized customer needs.
The product sourcing program is designed to ensure that the Company is able to offer consistent product selections and market competitive pricing across the enterprise while maintaining the ability to service localized market requirements. Our procurement program is also focused on replenishment which includes purchase order placement and controlling the total cost of inventory by proactively managing the number of days inventory on hand, negotiating favorable payment terms and maintaining vendor-owned and vendor-managed programs. As one of the largest purchasers of packaging, facility supplies, and paper and graphics products, we can qualify for volume allowances with some suppliers and can realize significant economies of scale. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 29% of our purchases were made from ten suppliers.
Competition
The business-to-business distribution industry is highly competitive, with numerous regional and local competitors, and is a mature industry characterized by slowing growth or, in the case of paper, declining demand. The Company's principal competitors include national, regional and local distributors, national and regional manufacturers, international paper manufacturers, other merchants and brokers and both catalog-based and online business-to-business suppliers. Most of these competitors generally offer a wide range of products at prices comparable to those Veritiv offers, though at varying service levels. Additionally, new competition could arise from non-traditional sources, group purchasing organizations, e-commerce, discount wholesalers or consolidation among competitors. Veritiv believes it offers the full range of services required to effectively compete, but if new competitive sources appear, it may result in margin erosion or make it more difficult to attract and retain customers.
The following summary briefly describes the key competitive landscape for each of Veritiv's reportable segments:
•Packaging – The packaging market is fragmented and consists of competition from national and regional packaging distributors, national and regional manufacturers of packaging materials, independent brokers and both catalog-based and online business-to-business suppliers. Veritiv believes there are few national packaging distributors with substrate neutral design capabilities similar to the Company's capabilities.
•Facility Solutions – There are few national, but numerous regional and local distributors of facility supply solutions. Several groups of distributors have created strategic alliances among multiple distributors to provide broader geographic coverage for larger customers. Other key competitors include the business-to-business divisions of big box stores, purchasing group affiliates and both catalog-based and online business-to-business suppliers.
•Print Solutions – While the Company believes there are few national distributors of paper and graphics products similar to Veritiv, several regional and local distributors have cooperated together to serve customers nationally. Competitors also include office supply and big box stores, online business-to-business suppliers, independent brokers and large commercial printers that broker the sale of paper in connection with the sale of their printing services. The publishing market is serviced by printers, paper brokers and distributors, and that market consists primarily of magazine and book publishers, cataloguers, direct mailers and retail customers using catalog, insert and direct mail as a method of advertising. 
We believe that our competitive advantages include the approximately 975 sales and marketing professionals we utilize and the wide selection of products, including high-quality private brands that we offer. The breadth of products and services offered, the diversity of the types of customers served, and our broad geographic footprint in the U.S. and Mexico buffer the impact of regional economic declines while also providing a network to readily service national accounts.
Distribution and Logistics
Timely and accurate delivery of a customer's order, on a consistent basis, are important criteria in a customer's decision to purchase products and services from Veritiv. Delivery of products is provided through two primary channels, either from the Company's distribution centers or directly from the manufacturer. Our distribution centers offer a range of delivery options depending on the customer's needs and preferences, and the strategic placement of the distribution centers also allows for delivery of special or "rush" orders to many customers. 
Working Capital
Veritiv's working capital needs generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory in our distribution centers to meet delivery requirements of our customers, as well as significant accounts receivable balances. As is typical in our industry, our customers often do not pay upon receipt, but are offered terms which are dependent on the specific circumstances of the sale. 
Human Capital
Veritiv’s key human capital management objectives include attracting, developing, engaging and retaining skilled and diverse talent, and promoting safety to drive the success of our business and to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers. These objectives are aligned with our Veritiv Values: Integrity, One Team, People Commitment, Customer Focus, Operational Excellence and Passion for Results.
Our workforce includes employees in sales, customer service, warehouse operations and corporate functions. By geography, approximately 90%, 8% and 2% of our workforce is located in the U.S., Mexico and the rest of world, respectively, with a presence in almost every state in the U.S. Approximately 67% of our workforce is male, and the other 33% is female.
As of December 31, 2022, Veritiv had approximately 5,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 7% were in collective bargaining units. Approximately 24% of those employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in 2023. Labor contract negotiations are handled on an individual basis by a cross-functional team including Human Resources and Operations, with legal support. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements on satisfactory terms. We consider labor relations to be good.
We reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefit programs; enhance the Company’s culture through our values and other engagement efforts; develop talent internally through job rotations and learning programs to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; and strive to make safety a key focus across the organization. Some examples of programs and initiatives designed to attract, develop, engage and retain our workforce and to promote safety include:
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI")
We recognize that our people are critical to the success of our business and our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers. We strive to build a workforce that reflects the diversity of our stakeholders in communities globally where we live and work, and ensures that all employees have opportunities to grow, thrive and advance. We have developed a multi-year diversity, equity and inclusion strategy with an emphasis on leadership and culture, talent acquisition and enhancing the employee experience. Our strategy has included broadening our applicant pools to attract diverse talent prioritizing employee development and advancement, and implementing micro-learning modules focused on educating our workforce on unconscious bias, cultural competence and inclusive leadership. This strategy has allowed us to refine our recruiting efforts, leadership accountability, performance management processes and other practices to support our diversity, equity and inclusion goals.
In 2022, we communicated our initial Company-wide DEI strategy and goals with all employees to gain alignment and adoption across the Company. The DEI strategy is led by our Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, with oversight from our senior lead team. We continue to develop and refine our strategy, measure our progress through regular evaluation of key metrics and communicate progress with our employees.
•Employee Engagement
We have been successful in engaging our employees to participate in our first Employee Engagement Survey. The survey launched to all employees except for our U.S. teams that are under collective bargaining agreements. All managers, along with their teams, established action plans based on opportunities identified in the survey results. We continue to make progress on in-depth action plans to address issues and feedback raised.
We launched our new Social and Points-based Recognition Platform BRAVO!. Our recognition platform is used to recognize and reward behaviors aligned to the Veritiv Values. We were also able to launch a variety of other recognition programs within the platform designated to incentivize specific behaviors and actions supporting our priorities.
We also launched the Veritiv Cultural Alliance ("VCA"). VCA was established to serve as boots on the ground, positioning a culture ally at almost every Veritiv location. Allies are tasked with increasing awareness and participation of our hourly worker population as well as supporting and championing corporate initiatives among all employees in our locations.
In 2022, Veritiv contributed $3.5 million to the Veritiv Charitable Giving Fund, a philanthropic fund that supports non-profit charities that are qualified under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3).
•Employee Well-Being and Safety
We provide comprehensive healthcare benefits to virtually all of our employees in the U.S. that are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of our diverse workforce. In addition, we provide free mental health, behavioral health and other wellness resources, including on-demand access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents. We are committed to providing all team members with a safe and healthy workplace and continuing to refine our culture of proactive safety. Managing and reducing risks at our facilities remains a focus, and in 2022, our Total Injury Rate for our operations in the U.S. and Mexico was 0.92. Total Injury Rate ("TIR") is calculated using the OSHA criteria for recordability and OSHA calculation methodologies. TIR is equivalent to Total Recordable Injuries x 200,000/Total Hours Worked. The 200,000 hours in the formula represent the equivalent of 100 employees working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year and provides the standard basis for the injury rate.
•Talent Development and Learning
We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees gain skills and develop in their careers through a multitude of training and development programs. These include online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats as well as executive assessment, coaching, talent and succession planning. We have a robust talent review and succession planning process, and our goal is to have at least one "ready now" candidate and one "ready in 1 – 3 years" candidate for each critical position to prepare candidates for critical roles. 
We support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and personal development. These educational opportunities include (i) tuition assistance for employees in the U.S. and Mexico and (ii) a unique Company-paid program that supports hourly warehouse workers to become certified, licensed truck drivers and provides opportunities to get licensed and gain required driver hours on work time. We sponsor a paid internship program that provides job experience to high school and college students in a variety of job functions and is a source for future full-time talent.  To identify our top talent and prepare them for future leadership roles, we launched two cohorts of our LEAD Program in 2022, which we designed in partnership with the University of Georgia Business School. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued our focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees in our distribution centers and our offices while meeting the needs of our customers and mitigating any interruptions to our business. We have continued to modify practices at our distribution centers and offices informed by guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health and governmental authorities. These practices include social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment. Our employees continue to adapt to the changes in work environment and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time. 
Government Relations
Our transportation operations are subject to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We are also subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding licensing and inspection of facilities, including compliance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and establish communication programs to transmit information regarding the hazards of certain chemicals present in specific products that we distribute.
We are also subject to regulation by numerous U.S. and Mexican federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers. Although we are subject to other U.S. and Mexican federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment and the discharge or destruction of materials, these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of the Company's facilities. Compliance with these laws has not had, and is not anticipated to have, a material effect on Veritiv's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous well-recognized trademarks, represented primarily by our private label brands. See the Products and Services section of this Item 1. Business for additional information related to our private label brand sales. Most of our trademark registrations are effective for an initial period of ten years, and we generally renew our trademark registrations before their expiration dates for trademarks that are in use or have reasonable potential for future use. Although our businesses rely on a number of trademarks that, in the aggregate, provide important protections to the Company, no single trademark is material to any one of these segments. Additionally, Veritiv does not have any material patents or licenses.
Seasonality
The Company's operating results are subject to seasonal influences.  Historically, our higher consolidated net sales have occurred during the third and fourth quarters while our lowest consolidated net sales have occurred during the first quarter. The Packaging segment net sales have traditionally increased each quarter throughout the year and net sales for the first quarter have typically been less than net sales for the fourth quarter of the preceding year.  Production schedules for non-durable goods that build up to the holidays and peak in the fourth quarter drive this seasonal net sales pattern.  Net sales for the Facility Solutions segment have traditionally peaked in the third quarter due to increased summer demand in the away-from-home resort, cruise and hospitality markets and from back-to-school activities. Within the Print Solutions segment, seasonality is 
driven by increased magazine advertising page counts, retail inserts, catalogs and direct mail primarily due to back-to-school, political election and holiday-related advertising and promotions in the second half of the year. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused minor disruptions to the Company's seasonal patterns in net sales across all segments and on a consolidated basis, primarily due to the impacts that the pandemic has had on many of Veritiv's customers. The duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and the magnitude of continuing seasonality disruption is difficult to predict.
