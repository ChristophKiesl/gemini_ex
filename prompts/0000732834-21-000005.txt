Item 1.    Business
General
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company formed in 1967 engaged in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas in the North, South and East regions of the United States. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in our key operating areas. The North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken, and the Red River units. The South region includes all properties south of Nebraska and west of the Mississippi River including various plays in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. The East region is primarily comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage east of the Mississippi River with no significant drilling or production operations. 
Our operations in the North region comprised 55% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 65% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana. Approximately 48% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 are located in the North region. Our operations in the South region comprised 45% of our crude oil and natural gas production, 35% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues, and 52% of our proved reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
We focus our activities in large new or developing crude oil and natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions for future drilling operations. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation), pad/row development, and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. 
As of December 31, 2020, our proved reserves were 1,104 MMBoe, with proved developed reserves representing 627 MMBoe, or 57%, of our total proved reserves. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled $4.65 billion at December 31, 2020. For 2020, we generated crude oil and natural gas revenues of $2.56 billion and operating cash flows of $1.42 billion. Crude oil accounted for 53% of our total production and 86% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2020. Our total production averaged 300,090 Boe per day for 2020, a decrease of 12% compared to 2019. 
The table below summarizes our total proved reserves, PV-10 (non-GAAP) and net producing wells as of December 31, 2020, average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and the reserve-to-production index in our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates.

(1)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $239 million. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.
(2)The Annualized Reserve/Production Index is the number of years that estimated proved reserves would last assuming current production continued at the same rate. This index is calculated by dividing annualized fourth quarter 2020 production into estimated proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2020.
Business Environment and Outlook
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the proliferation of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus). The ensuing economic turmoil caused by the pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in global and domestic demand for crude oil due to, among other things, changes in consumer behavior and restrictions implemented by governments to mitigate the pandemic. This demand destruction contributed to an unprecedented decline in crude oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate benchmark prices reaching all-time lows in April 2020. In response to the significant reduction in crude oil prices, we began voluntarily curtailing our production in April 2020 and ultimately curtailed approximately 55% of our operated crude oil production and associated natural gas in the 2020 second quarter. Additionally, in light of the challenges facing our business and industry, we implemented cost saving initiatives and significantly reduced our operated rig and completion crew counts in order to preserve our assets and better align our capital spending with expected available cash flows, resulting in a $1.5 billion, or 56%, decrease in our non-acquisition capital spending in 2020 compared to 2019. These actions, coupled with historically low crude oil prices, resulted in a material reduction in our production, revenues, and cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019. 
Crude oil prices began to stabilize in mid-2020 and generally improved in the second half of 2020 in response to the gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of economic activity, and the resulting increase in crude oil demand. In July 2020 we began to gradually restore our curtailed production and subsequently brought our remaining curtailed production back online in September 2020. As a result of our resumed production, coupled with strategic well completion activities in late 2020, our total average production improved to 339,307 Boe per day for the 2020 fourth quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020, yet still remaining 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Despite the gradual improvement in crude oil prices in the second half of 2020, we continued our commitment to operating in a disciplined, capital efficient manner. Improved revenues from higher commodity prices coupled with our tempered spending resulted in the generation of cash flows in excess of operating and capital needs in the second half of 2020 that allowed for a $210 million net reduction in our total debt at December 31, 2020 compared to June 30, 2020. Additionally, despite production curtailments during the year, we continued to drive our per-unit production expenses lower to $3.27 per Boe for 2020 compared to $3.58 per Boe for 2019. 
We remain committed to the responsible stewardship of our assets and continue to focus on maximizing cash flows, further reducing debt, delivering low-cost capital efficient operations, and generating shareholder value. The depth and quality of our asset base, the commodity optionality provided by our significant amount of acreage held by production, and our financial strength allow us to be adaptable in a variety of price environments. We remain flexible as we monitor and adapt to market conditions. 
For 2021, our primary business strategies will focus on generating shareholder value by:
•Continuing to exercise capital and operational discipline to maximize cash flow generation; 
•Reducing outstanding debt;
•Capitalizing on commodity optionality afforded to us by our crude oil and natural gas assets; and
•Maintaining low-cost operations. 
Our Business Strategies
Despite volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices, our business strategies continue to be focused on generating shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at low costs and attractive rates of return. The principal elements of this strategy include:
Growing and sustaining our premier portfolio of assets in a disciplined manner to maximize cash flow generation. We hold a portfolio of leasehold acreage, drilling opportunities, uncompleted wells, perpetually owned minerals, and water infrastructure assets in certain premier U.S. resource plays with varying access to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Our capital programs are designed to allocate investments to projects that provide the best opportunities to generate cash flows in excess of operating and capital requirements, capitalize on movements in strip pricing between crude oil and natural gas, convert our undeveloped acreage to acreage held by production, harvest our inventory of uncompleted wells, and improve hydrocarbon recoveries and rates of return on capital employed. We are strongly aligned with shareholders and our strategic vision is predicated on our desire to generate shareholder value through various means. 
Reducing outstanding debt. Maintaining a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and financial flexibility are key components of our business strategy. A cornerstone of our 2021 plan is to maximize cash flow generation to pay down debt. In 2021 and beyond we will continue our focus on paying down debt and preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry.
Capitalizing on commodity optionality afforded to us by our crude oil and natural gas assets. We have a deep inventory of both oil and gas assets across the Bakken and Oklahoma that allow us to be responsive to, and benefit from, changes in oil and gas commodity price fundamentals. This commodity optionality provides an inherent advantage to Continental. Not only do we have the ability to shift capital between our Bakken and Oklahoma assets, but within Oklahoma we have the ability to shift capital between oil-weighted or gas-weighted projects depending on which commodity has a stronger price outlook. We also have direct access to multiple premium markets from our Oklahoma assets, which allow us to pursue either oil or gas markets as prices and fundamentals warrant. For 2021, we plan to remain flexible and responsive with our drilling and completion programs to capitalize on relative movements in oil and gas prices. 
Maintaining low-cost operations. Our culture is defined by our low cost operations and in 2020 we again delivered low cost industry leadership despite the challenges facing our business. We continue to manage our business in the volatile commodity price environment by focusing on improving operating and capital efficiencies and reducing costs by exploiting technical innovations, pad and row development opportunities, and other means. Our key operating areas are characterized by large acreage positions in select unconventional resource plays with multiple stacked geologic formations that provide repeatable drilling opportunities and resource potential. We operate a significant portion of our wells and leasehold acreage and believe the concentration of our operated assets allows us to leverage our technical expertise and manage the development of our properties to enhance operating efficiencies and economies of scale. Our operational excellence has allowed us to achieve and maintain enviable low-cost operations. 
Our Business Strengths
We have a number of strengths to allow us to successfully execute our business strategies, including the following:
Large acreage inventory with access to both crude oil and natural gas resources. We held approximately 359,300 net undeveloped acres and 1.23 million net developed acres under lease as of December 31, 2020 concentrated in certain premier U.S. resource plays that provide optionality and access to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. We are among the largest leaseholders in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Being an early entrant in these plays has allowed us to capture significant acreage positions in core parts of the plays. 
Expertise with pad and row development, horizontal drilling, and optimized completion methods. We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and optimized completion methods and continue to be among industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad and row development strategies. Further, we are among industry leaders in drilling long lateral lengths. We have also been among industry leaders in testing and utilizing optimized completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage spacing to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties. 
Control operations over a substantial portion of our assets and investments. As of December 31, 2020, we operated properties comprising 88% of our total proved reserves. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used. Additionally, we capitalize on our geologic knowledge and land expertise to strategically acquire minerals in areas of future growth, thereby allowing us to enhance cash flows and project economics through the alignment of mineral ownership with our drilling schedule. Further, we continue to grow our significant portfolio of water gathering, recycling, and disposal infrastructure assets which allow for uninterrupted flow back and recycling capabilities, supports timely completion activities, and generates additional service revenues and cash flows. Our strategies for growing our mineral ownership portfolio and water infrastructure assets serve as additional avenues to generate shareholder value.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry and with operating in challenging commodity price environments. Our Executive Chairman, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 8 executive officers have an average of 41 years of oil and gas industry experience.
Financial Position and Liquidity. We have a credit facility with lender commitments totaling $1.5 billion that matures in April 2023. We had approximately $1.33 billion of borrowing availability on our credit facility at December 31, 2020 after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. Our credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants. 
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations
    Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole, production, seismic, and well test data.
The table below sets forth estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves information by reserve category as of December 31, 2020. Proved reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests are not material relative to our consolidated reserves and are not separately presented herein. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $4.65 billion at December 31, 2020. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020 are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 93% of our PV-10 and 95% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020. Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott’s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 at December 31, 2020 were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2020 through December 2020, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $39.57 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.99 per MMBtu for natural gas ($34.34 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.17 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). These average prices are significantly lower than 2019 levels, which resulted in significant downward price-related revisions to proved reserves in 2020. Additionally, in 2020 we reduced the scope of our future drilling programs in response to the reduction in consumer demand and lower prices prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the removal of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to 
be drilled within five years of initial booking. These revisions are further discussed below and contributed to significant decreases in our proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 in 2020 compared to 2019.
The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves by commodity and reserve classification as of December 31, 2020. 

 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe) | PV-10 (1)(in millions)

(1)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $239 million. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.

Proved reserves at end of year | 1,103,762 | | 1,619,265 | | 1,522,365

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions for 2020 are comprised of (i) the removal of 50 MMBo and 345 Bcf (totaling 107 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to a reduction in the scope of our future drilling programs based on adverse market conditions, reduced demand, and lower prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and our resulting allocation of capital to areas providing the best opportunities to improve efficiencies, 
recoveries, and rates of return, (ii) downward revisions of 29 MMBo and 172 Bcf (totaling 58 MMBoe) from the removal of PUD reserves due to changes in economics, performance, and other factors, (iii) downward price revisions of 214 MMBo and 1,043 Bcf (totaling 388 MMBoe) due to the significant decrease in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2020 compared to 2019 resulting from the economic turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, and (iv) net upward revisions of 43 MMBo and 31 Bcf (totaling 48 MMBoe) due to changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors.
Extensions, discoveries and other additions. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were due to successful drilling and completion activities and continual refinement of our drilling programs in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK plays. Proved reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 41 MMBoe, 160 MMBoe, and 251 MMBoe for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, while reserve additions in SCOOP totaled 49 MMBoe, 186 MMBoe, and 186 MMBoe for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Additionally, reserve additions in STACK totaled 1 MMBoe, 19 MMBoe, and 128 MMBoe in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2020 drilling activities. 
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of proved reserves in the past three years. 
Purchases of minerals in place. We had no individually significant acquisitions of proved reserves in the past three years.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2020 are located in the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK plays, our most active development areas, with those plays comprising 48%, 48%, and 4%, respectively, of our total PUD reserves at year-end 2020. The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2020 include 98 MMBoe of reserves associated with wells where drilling has occurred but the wells have not been completed or are completed but not producing ("DUC wells"). Our DUC wells are classified as PUD reserves when relatively major expenditures are required to complete and produce from the wells. 

 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe)
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 | 423,782 | | 2,928,354 | | 911,841

Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020 | 215,069 | | 1,567,713 | | 476,355 

Revisions of previous estimates. As previously discussed, in 2020 we removed 50 MMBo and 345 Bcf (totaling 107 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to a reduction in the scope of our future drilling programs based on adverse market conditions, reduced demand, and lower prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these removals, 31 MMBo and 90 Bcf (totaling 46 MMBoe) was related to Bakken properties, 18 MMBo and 224 Bcf (totaling 56 MMBoe) was related to SCOOP properties, and 31 Bcf (5 MMBoe) was related to STACK properties. Additionally, changes in economics, performance, and other factors resulted in downward PUD reserve revisions of 29 MMBo and 172 Bcf (totaling 58 MMBoe) in 2020. The significant decreases in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors resulted in downward price revisions of 145 MMBo and 813 Bcf (totaling 280 MMBoe). Finally, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors resulted in net upward revisions for PUD reserves of 13 MMBo and 6 Bcf (totaling 14 MMBoe) in 2020.
Extensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries were primarily due to successful drilling activities and continual refinement of our drilling programs in the Bakken and SCOOP plays. PUD reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 27 MMBo and 56 Bcf (totaling 36 MMBoe) in 2020, while SCOOP PUD reserve additions totaled 11 MMBo and 216 Bcf (totaling 47 MMBoe). 
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of PUD reserves in 2020.
Purchases of minerals in place. We had no individually significant acquisitions of PUD reserves in 2020.
Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2020, we developed approximately 12% of our PUD locations and 10% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2019 through the drilling and completion of 328 gross (149 net) development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately $439 million incurred in 2020. 
Our original capital budget for 2020 was $2.65 billion, which was reduced to $1.2 billion in March 2020 in response to the sudden, unprecedented decrease in crude oil prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Due to economic uncertainty from the pandemic, we significantly reduced our drilling and completion activities from previously planned levels in order to preserve financial flexibility and better align our spending with expected available cash flows. These factors adversely impacted our conversion of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves in 2020. 
Development plans. We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in the Bakken, SCOOP and STACK plays. Our drilling programs to date in those areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. While we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations, including our drilled but not completed locations. Our inventory of DUC wells classified as PUDs total 316 gross (121 net) operated and non-operated locations at December 31, 2020 and represent 20% of our PUD reserves at that date. The costs to drill our uncompleted wells were incurred prior to December 31, 2020 and only the remaining completion costs are included in future development plans. 
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves are projected to be approximately $732 million in 2021, $734 million in 2022, $889 million in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2024, and $448 million in 2025. These capital expenditure projections have been established based on an expectation of drilling and completion costs, available cash flows, borrowing capacity, and the commodity price environment in effect at the time of preparing our reserve estimates and may be adjusted as market conditions evolve. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2020 is expected to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be drilled within five years of initial booking because of changes in business strategy or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2020. We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2020 that remain undeveloped beyond five years from the date of initial booking. 
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Ryder Scott, our independent reserves evaluation consulting firm, estimated, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC, 93% of our PV-10 and 95% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K. The Ryder Scott technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Refer to Exhibit 99 included with this Form 10-K for further discussion of the qualifications of Ryder Scott personnel.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserves engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team is in contact regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott’s preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. Proved reserves information is reviewed by our Audit Committee with representatives of Ryder Scott and by our internal technical staff before the information is filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. Additionally, certain members of our senior management review and approve the Ryder Scott reserves report and on a semi-annual basis review any internal proved reserves estimates.
Our Vice President—Corporate Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, an MBA in Finance and 36 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations, acquisitions, engineering and evaluations. He has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering most of his career and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Vice President—Corporate Reserves reports directly to our Vice Chairman of Strategic Growth Initiatives. The reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by certain members of the Company's executive management.
Proved Reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities
Our year-end 2020 proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 estimates were prepared using 2020 average first-day-of-the-month prices of $39.57 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.99 per MMBtu for natural gas ($34.34 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.17 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than those used in our year-end estimates. 
Provided below are sensitivities illustrating the potential impact on our estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 at December 31, 2020 under different commodity price scenarios for crude oil and natural gas. In these sensitivities, all factors other than the commodity price assumption have been held constant for each well. These sensitivities do not take into account a potential increase in our drilling activities and associated booking of additional proved reserves that may occur at higher commodity prices and there is no assurance the outcomes reflected below will be realized. 
The crude oil price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 under certain crude oil price scenarios, with natural gas prices being held constant at the 2020 average first-day-of-the-month price of $1.99 per MMBtu.

The natural gas price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 under certain natural gas price scenarios, with crude oil prices being held constant at the 2020 average first-day-of-the-month price of $39.57 per Bbl.

Drilling Activity
During the three years ended December 31, 2020, we participated in the drilling and completion of exploratory and development wells as set forth in the table below. As previously discussed, we significantly reduced our drilling and completion activities in 2020 in response to reduced crude oil prices, which resulted in a significant decrease in the number of wells completed during 2020 compared to prior years.

As of December 31, 2020, there were 459 gross (156 net) operated and non-operated wells that have been spud and are in the process of drilling, completing or waiting on completion. 
Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
In the following discussion, we review our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures for 2021 in our key operating areas. Our 2021 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be funded from operating cash flows. Our drilling and completion activities and the actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our budget as a result of, among other things, available cash flows, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling and completion results, the availability of drilling and completion rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of transportation and processing capacity, changes in commodity prices, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and may scale back our spending should commodity prices decrease from current levels. Conversely, an increase in commodity prices from current levels could result in increased capital expenditures. 
The following table provides information regarding well counts and budgeted capital expenditures for 2021.

 | 2021 Plan 
 | Gross wells (1) | Net wells (1) | | Capital expenditures (in millions) (2)
North Region | 229 | | 94 | | | $ | 732 
South Region | 120 | | 57 | | | 380 | 
Total exploration and development | 349 | | 151 | | | $ | 1,112

Mineral acquisitions attributable to Franco-Nevada (3) | | | | 52 | 
Total 2021 capital budget | | | | $ | 1,452 | 

(1) Represents operated and non-operated wells expected to have first production in 2021.
(2) Represents total capital expenditures for operated and non-operated wells expected to have first production in 2021 and wells spud that will be in the process of drilling, completing or waiting on completion as of year-end 2021. Amounts exclude our pending acquisition of properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming for $215 million as discussed in Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies. 
(3)    Represents planned spending for mineral acquisitions by The Mineral Resources Company II, LLC ("TMRC II") under our relationship with Franco-Nevada Corporation described in Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16. Noncontrolling Interests. Continental holds a controlling financial interest in TMRC II and therefore consolidates the financial results and capital expenditures of the entity. With a carry structure in place, Continental will fund 20% of 2021 planned spending, or $13 million, and Franco-Nevada will fund the remaining 80%, or $52 million. 
North Region 
Our properties in the North region represented 48% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 56% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field.
Bakken Field
The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the largest crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2020, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Bakken with approximately 1.3 million gross (786,500 net) acres under lease. 
Our total Bakken production averaged 183,141 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2020, down 6% from the 2019 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our average daily Bakken production decreased 19% compared to 2019, reflecting our reduction in drilling and completion activities and the impact of voluntary production curtailments during the year. In 2020, we participated in the drilling and completion of 188 gross (77 net) wells in the Bakken compared to 379 gross (124 net) wells in 2019. Our 2020 activities in the Bakken focused on ongoing multi-zone unit development in core areas of the play. 
Our Bakken properties represented 46% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2020 and 54% of our average daily Boe production for the 2020 fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2020 were 509 MMBoe, a decrease of 39% compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to downward reserve revisions prompted by significantly reduced commodity prices and resulting changes in drilling plans. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Bakken totaled 849 gross (404 net) wells as of December 31, 2020.
For 2021, our budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the North region is $732 million. In 2021, we expect to have first production on 229 gross (94 net) operated and non-operated wells in the North region. We plan to average approximately seven operated rigs and three well completion crews in the North region in 2021. Our 2021 drilling and completion activities in the Bakken will continue to focus on multi-zone unit development in areas that provide opportunities to improve capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, improve recoveries and rates of return, and maximize cash flows.
South Region
Our properties in the South region represented 52% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 44% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our principal producing properties in the South region are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma. 
SCOOP
The SCOOP play extends across Garvin, Grady, Stephens, Carter, McClain and Love counties in Oklahoma and contains crude oil and condensate-rich fairways as delineated by numerous industry wells. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the SCOOP play. As of December 31, 2020, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in SCOOP with approximately 460,500 gross (273,800 net) acres under lease. 
SCOOP represented 43% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 32% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2020. Production in SCOOP averaged 107,060 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2020, down 4% compared to the 2019 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2020, average daily production in SCOOP increased 16% compared to 2019, reflecting additional drilling and completion activities in our Project SpringBoard which exceeded the impact of production curtailments in the play during the year. We participated in the drilling and completion of 123 gross (46 net) wells in SCOOP during 2020 compared to 207 gross (93 net) wells in 2019. Our total proved SCOOP field reserves as of December 31, 2020 were 478 MMBoe, a decrease of 17% compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to downward reserve revisions prompted by significantly reduced commodity prices and resulting changes in drilling plans. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in SCOOP totaled 262 gross (164 net) wells as of December 31, 2020.
STACK
The STACK play is located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and is characterized by stacked geologic formations with major targets in the Meramec, Osage, and Woodford formations. As of December 31, 2020, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in STACK with approximately 353,900 gross (191,600 net) acres under lease. 
Our STACK properties represented 9% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 12% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2020. Production in STACK averaged 42,281 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2020, down 18% from the 2019 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2020, average daily production in STACK decreased 30% compared to 2019, reflecting our reduction in drilling and completion activities and the impact of voluntary production curtailments during the year. We participated in the drilling and completion of 22 gross (8 net) wells in STACK during 2020 compared to 103 gross (19 net) wells in 2019. Proved reserves in STACK decreased 46% year-over-year to 98 MMBoe as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to downward reserve revisions prompted by significantly reduced commodity prices and resulting changes in drilling plans. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in STACK totaled 25 gross (9 net) wells as of December 31, 2020.
For 2021, our aggregate budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the South region is $380 million. In 2021, we expect to have first production on 120 gross (57 net) operated and non-operated wells in the South region. We plan to average approximately four operated rigs and two well completion crews in the South region in 2021. Our 2021 activities will focus on continued row development in Project SpringBoard in the SCOOP play and ongoing development in areas that provide opportunities to improve capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, improve recoveries and rates of return, and maximize cash flows.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of acquiring oil and gas leases covering fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records and production databases to determine fee mineral ownership and availability. Title, lease forms and terms are reviewed and approved by Company landmen prior to consummation. 
For acquisitions from third parties, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses, obtain physical well site inspections, and examine the seller’s internal records (land, legal, operational, production, environmental, well, marketing and accounting) upon execution of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement. Company landmen may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties. 
Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, Company landmen procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title defects, if any. Company landmen will not approve commencement of drilling operations until material title defects pertaining to the Company’s interest are cured. 
The Company has cured material title opinion defects as to Company interests on substantially all of its producing properties and believes it holds at least defensible title to its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The Company’s crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which do not materially interfere with the Company’s interest in the properties or affect the Company’s carrying value of such properties.
Marketing
We sell most of our operated crude oil production to crude oil refining companies or midstream marketing companies at major market centers. In the Bakken, SCOOP, and STACK areas we have significant volumes of production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining production primarily transported by truck to a point on a pipeline system for further delivery. We do not transport any of our oil production prior to sale by rail, but several purchasers of our Bakken production are connected to rail delivery systems and may choose those methods to transport the oil they purchase from us. We sell some operated crude oil production at the lease. Our share of crude oil production from non-operated properties is marketed at the discretion of the operators. 
We sell our operated natural gas production to midstream customers at our lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur. These contracts include multi-year term agreements, many with acreage dedications. Under certain arrangements, we have the right to take a volume of processed residue gas and/or natural gas liquids ("NGLs") in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream customer's processing plant in lieu of a monetary settlement for the sale of our operated natural gas production. We currently take certain processed residue gas volumes in kind in lieu of monetary settlement, but we do not currently take NGL volumes. When we do take volumes in kind, we pay third parties to transport the residue gas volumes taken in kind to downstream delivery points, where we then sell to customers at prices applicable to those downstream markets. Sales at the downstream markets are mostly under daily and monthly packaged volumes deals, shorter term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have the potential to enter into additional contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of products we elect to take in-kind in lieu of monetary settlement for our leasehold sales. Our share of natural gas production from non-operated properties is generally marketed at the discretion of the operators. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for crude oil and natural gas properties, minerals, and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In addition, as a result of depressed commodity prices in recent years, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be further increased in connection with any period of sustained commodity price recovery. Finally, the emerging impact of climate change activism, fuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing demand for alternative forms of energy, and 
technological advances in energy generation devices may result in reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. 
Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
All of our operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive with the frequent imposition of new or increased requirements. These laws, regulations and other requirements often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply and may have a significant effect on our operations and may increase the cost of doing business and reduce our profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us materially different than they will affect our similarly situated competitors.
The following is a discussion of certain significant laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that may affect us in the areas in which we operate.
Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids
Our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil are subject to anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). These laws, among other things, prohibit fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we can be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
We transport most of our operated crude oil production to market centers using a combination of trucks and pipeline transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of crude oil by pipeline. Further, our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids ("NGLs") is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. As the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, the regulation of such transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors.
Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis and offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity we are subject to proration provisions, which are described in the pipelines’ published tariffs. We generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors.
From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. The International Maritime Organization ("IMO"), an agency of the United Nations, has issued regulations requiring the maritime shipping industry to gradually reduce its carbon emissions over time by mandating a 1% improvement in the efficiency of fleets each year between 2015 and 2025. In conjunction with this initiative, the IMO issued regulations requiring ship owners to lower the concentration of the sulfur content used in their fuels from 3.5% to 0.5% beginning on January 1, 2020. To achieve and maintain compliance with the new regulations, it is expected ship owners will either have to switch to more expensive higher quality marine fuel, install and utilize emissions-cleaning systems, or switch to alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas. Failure to comply with the regulations may result in fines or shipping vessels being detained, thereby resulting in exportation capacity constraints that inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell domestic crude oil production overseas, which may have a material impact on the markets and prices for various grades of domestic and international crude oil. The ultimate long-term impact of the IMO regulations is uncertain. 
We do not own or operate pipeline or rail transportation facilities, rail cars, or infrastructure used to facilitate the exportation of crude oil. However, regulations that impact the domestic transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business 
and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States. We do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
We are also required to observe the aforementioned anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and CFTC in connection with physical sales of natural gas and any derivative instruments relating to natural gas. Additionally, the FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to increase competition and make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis and has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. We cannot provide any assurance the pro-competitive regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken by the FERC will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers.
The gathering of natural gas, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the potential to increase costs for our purchasers and reduce the revenues we receive for our natural gas stream. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. We do not believe such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers on a comparable basis, the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
The U.S. Department of Energy (“U.S. DOE”) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or “LNG”). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) with the United States providing for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE’s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without an FTA is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices and could inhibit the development of LNG infrastructure.
Regulation of production
The production of crude oil and natural gas is regulated by a wide range of federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Each of the states where we own and operate properties have laws and regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, the plugging and abandonment of wells, the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and limitations or prohibitions on the venting or flaring of natural gas. These laws and regulations directly and indirectly limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells and locations we can drill, although we can and do apply for exceptions to such laws and regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax on the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with the above laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors are generally subject to the same laws, rules, and regulations as we are.
Environmental regulation
General. We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:
•require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations;
•restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with crude oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;
•limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals;
•require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and
•impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.
These laws, rules and regulations may restrict the level of substances generated by our operations that may be emitted into the air, discharged to surface water, and disposed or otherwise released to surface and below-ground soils and groundwater, and may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production to a rate that is economically infeasible for continued production. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and federal and state legislators and agencies frequently revise environmental laws, rules and regulations and with party control of Congress shifting in January 2021, there is potential for the Biden Administration to pursue new legislation and regulatory initiatives that revise the permitting or leasing policies pursued under the Trump Administration that could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. Moreover, President Biden has issued, and may continue to issue, executive orders in pursuit of his regulatory agenda. Any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation requirements for the crude oil and natural gas industry or restrict, delay or ban oil and gas permitting or leasing on federal lands could have a significant impact on our operating costs and production of oil and gas. Failure to comply with these and other laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation in a particular area. Additionally, certain of these environmental laws may result in imposition of joint and several or strict liability, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners or other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Certain environmental laws also provide for certain citizen suits, which allow persons or organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental laws. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The following is a description of some of the environmental laws, rules and regulations that apply to our operations.
Air emissions and climate change. Federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations have been and, in the future, will likely be enacted to address concerns about emissions of regulated air pollutants, including the potential effects of carbon dioxide, methane and other identified “greenhouse gas” emissions on the environment and climate worldwide, generally referred to as “climate change.” For example, since 2015 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") under the Obama Administration has made revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone, making the standard stricter. Since that time, the EPA under the Trump Administration has issued attainment and nonattainment designations and, on December 31, 2020, published notice of a final action, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard, electing to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS in 2020 without revision on a going-forward basis. However, this December 2020 final action is subject to legal challenge, and the NAAQS may be subject to further revision under the Biden Administration. State implementation of the revised NAAQS for ground-level ozone could result in stricter permitting requirements, a delay or prohibition on our ability to obtain such permits, or result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
With respect to climate change and the control of greenhouse gas emissions, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases as well as to restrict or eliminate future emissions. Federal regulatory initiatives have focused on establishing construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources, requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. For example, in 2016 the EPA under the Obama Administration finalized new regulations (New Source Performance Standard Subpart OOOOa, commonly referred to as “Quad Oa”) setting methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. However, in recent years following the beginning of the Trump Administration in 2017, the EPA has undertaken several measures to delay implementation of the methane standards. Recently, in September 2020, the EPA issued 
its final policy and technical amendments to the 2016 final rule. The policy amendments, effective September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and volatile organic compound requirements for the remaining sources that were established by former President Obama's Administration, whereas the technical amendments, effective November 16, 2020, included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules for gathering and boosting compressor stations and low-production wells, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and more. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the original 2016 standards and the EPA’s September 2020 final rules and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that, among other things, directed the EPA to reconsider the technical amendments and issue a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding those amendments by no later than September 2021. A reconsideration of the September 2020 policy amendments is expected to follow. The January 20, 2021 executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored "Paris Agreement," which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. While the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement under the Trump Administration, on January 20, 2021 President Biden issued an executive order recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating the United States’ nationally determined emissions reduction goal under the agreement. With the United States recommitting to the Paris Agreement, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement’s goals, which could require us to incur increased costs to comply with such requirements.
In addition, increasing concern over the threat of climate change arising from greenhouse gas emissions has given rise to a series of political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of hydrocarbons and emission of greenhouse gases. In addition to recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order, effective immediately, that suspends new crude oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. Building on this suspension, President Biden issued an executive order on January 27, 2021 that suspends new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive study of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. As of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 41,800 net undeveloped acres on federal lands.
The January 20, 2021 and January 27, 2021 executive orders do not apply to existing leases and the January 27, 2021 order further directs applicable agencies to eliminate subsidies for the oil and gas sector. Legal challenges to these orders are expected, with at least one industry group already filing a lawsuit in January 2021 in Wyoming federal district court and seeking to have the moratorium on leasing declared invalid. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other parties have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages, or that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for oil and gas producers, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to energy companies have also focused on sustainability issues and some of them may elect not to provide funding for energy companies. Limitation of investments in and financings for oil and gas producers could result in reduced access to capital, higher costs of capital and the restriction, delay, or cancellation of development and production activities.
While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change, we anticipate that initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will continue to develop. The adoption of state or federal legislation or regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide, could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions monitoring and control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in restrictions or cancellations in development and production activities, liability for infrastructure damages due to climate changes, or increases in the cost of consuming hydrocarbons and thereby reducing demand for crude oil and natural gas. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons, including the oil and gas we produce, which could lead to a reduction in our revenues. Also, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding for energy companies as President Biden recently signed an executive order calling for the development of a climate finance plan and, separately, the 
Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Finally, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events. Consequently, one or more of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
Environmental protection and natural gas flaring. One of our environmental initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, including the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota law permits flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well’s first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the North Dakota Industrial Commission ("NDIC") for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well. 
In addition, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans setting forth plans taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be connected within the first year of production. The NDIC currently requires us to capture 91% of the natural gas produced from a field. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficient rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of crude oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise crude oil production from such wells is not permitted to exceed 100 barrels of crude oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider temporary exemptions from the foregoing restrictions or for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect is a significant net increase in gas capture within one year of the date such relief is granted. Monetary penalty provisions also apply under this regulation if an operator fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. Ongoing compliance with the NDIC’s flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations.
We continue to strive to reduce natural gas flaring as much as practicable, but our efforts may not always be successful or cost-effective. Our levels of flaring are impacted by external factors such as investment from third parties in the development and continued operation of gas gathering and processing facilities and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners. Increased emissions from our facilities due to flaring could subject our facilities to more stringent air emission permitting requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs and potential construction delays.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies or to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies have studied the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would potentially increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance related to such activities. Also, the EPA has issued a final regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. We do not discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment works, so the impact of this regulation on us is not currently, and is not expected to be, material. 
In late 2016 the EPA published a final study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources in which the EPA indicated it found evidence that such activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. In its final report, the EPA indicated it was not able to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing activities or fully characterize the severity of impacts. Nonetheless, the results of the EPA’s study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. 
In 2016, the BLM under the Obama Administration published final rules related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. However, the BLM under the Trump Administration published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule in November 2018. Litigation challenging the BLM's 2016 final rule as well as its 2018 final rule rescinding the 2016 rule has been pursued by various states and industry and environmental groups. While a California federal court vacated the 2018 final rule in July 2020, a Wyoming federal court subsequently vacated the 2016 final rule in October 2020 and, accordingly, the 2016 final rule is no 
longer in effect. The Wyoming decision is expected to be appealed. Moreover, the BLM under a Biden Administration could seek to pursue regulatory initiatives that regulate hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. 
While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered but refused to adopt federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, there is a possibility that a Biden Administration will pursue such legislation. In addition to pursuing the revision of existing laws and regulations, President Biden has issued, and may continue to issue, additional executive orders in pursuit of his regulatory agenda with regards to limiting hydraulic fracturing.
In addition, regulators in states in which we operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”) has promulgated guidance for operators of crude oil and natural gas wells in certain seismically-active areas of the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. The OCC's guidance provides for seismic monitoring and for implementation of mitigation procedures, which may include curtailment or even suspension of operations in the event of concurrent seismic events within a particular radius of operations of a magnitude exceeding 2.5 on the Richter scale. If seismic events exceeding the OCC guidance thresholds were to occur near our active stimulation operations on a frequent basis, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have investigated whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. To address concerns regarding seismicity, some states, including states in which we operate, have pursued remedies that included delaying permit approvals, mandating a reduction in injection volumes, or shutting down or imposing moratoria on the use of injection wells. Moreover, regulators in states in which we operate have implemented additional requirements related to seismicity. For example, the OCC has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma utilizes a “traffic light” system wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA’s current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA’s future actions in this regard. 
The introduction of new environmental laws and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by oil and gas producers and we do not expect the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In recent years, we have increased our operation and use of water recycling and distribution facilities in Oklahoma that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits.
We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Employee Health and Safety. We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulation under Title III of the federal superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state laws and regulations require information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Human Capital
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,201 people, all of which were employed in the United States, with 716 employees being located at our corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and 485 employees located in our field offices located in Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana.  None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We believe our overall relations with our workforce are good.
Compensation
Because we operate in a highly competitive environment, we have designed our compensation program to attract, retain and motivate experienced, talented individuals.  Our program is also designed to align employee’s interests with those of our shareholders and to reward them for achieving the business and strategic objectives determined to be important to help the Company create and maintain advantage in a competitive environment.  We align our employee’s interests with those of our shareholders by making annual restricted stock awards to virtually all of our employees.  We reward our employees for their performance in helping the Company achieve its annual business and strategic objectives through our bonus program, which is also available to virtually all of our employees.  In order to ensure our compensation package remains competitive and fulfills our goal of recruiting and retaining talented employees, we consider competitive market compensation paid by other companies comparable to the Company in size, geographic location, and operations.
Safety
Safety is our highest priority and one of our core values. We promote safety with a robust health and safety program that includes employee orientation and training, contractor management, risk assessments, hazard identification and mitigation, audits, incident reporting and investigation, and corrective/preventative action development.   
Through our “Brother’s Keeper” program, we encourage each of our employees to be a proactive participant in ensuring the safety of all of the Company’s personnel.  We developed this program to leverage and continuously improve our ability to identify and prevent reoccurrence of unsafe behaviors and conditions.  This program recognizes and rewards any employee or contractor working on one of our locations who observes and reports outstanding safety and environmental behavior such as utilizing stop work authority, looking out for a co-worker, reporting incidents and near misses, or following proper safety procedures. This program positively impacts safety performance and has contributed to a substantial increase in our reporting rates and to decreases in recordable incident and lost time incident rates. Our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), a commonly used safety metric that measures the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time employees and contractors during a one year period, has decreased sequentially in each of the past three years and measured 0.40 for 2020, a 53% decrease compared to 2017.
Training and Development
We are committed to the training and development of our employees.  We believe that supporting our employees in achieving their career and development goals is a key element of our approach to attracting and retaining top talent.  We have invested in a variety of resources to support employees in achieving their career and development goals, including developing learning paths for individual contributors and leaders, creating the Continental Leadership Learning Center which offers numerous different instructor-led programs which foster employee development and acquiring a learning management system which provides access to numerous technical and soft skills online courses.  We also invest time and resources in supporting the creation of individual development plans for our employees. 
Health and Wellness
We offer various benefit programs designed to promote the health and well-being of our employees and their families. These benefits include medical, dental, and vision insurance plans; disability and life insurance plans; paid time off for holidays, vacation, sick leave, and other personal leave; and healthcare flexible spending accounts, among other things. In addition to these programs, we have a number of other programs designed to further promote the health and wellness of our employees. For instance, employees at our corporate headquarters have access to our fitness center. Additionally, we have an employee assistance program that offers counseling and referral services for a broad range of personal and family situations. We also offer a wellness plan that includes annual biometric screenings, flu shots, smoking cessation programs, and healthy snack options in our break rooms to encourage total body wellness.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, commencing in the first quarter of 2020, we have taken, and continue to take, proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. These measures have included the implementation of a voluntary testing program to provide our employees and their household members with reliable and timely test results when 
public testing options were limited and restricted, maintaining social distancing policies, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, reducing the number of people at our sites, requiring the use of masks in certain circumstances, suspending employee business travel, requiring employees to complete daily self-screening questionnaires, performing temperature checks, frequently and extensively disinfecting common areas, performing rigorous contact tracing protocols, and implementing self-isolation and quarantine requirements, among other things. We are committed to maintaining best practices with our COVID-19 response protocols and will continue to work under the guidance of public health officials to ensure a safe workplace as long as COVID-19 remains a threat to our employees and communities. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive workplace and career development opportunities to attract and retain talented employees. We recognize that a diverse workforce provides the best opportunity to obtain unique perspectives, experiences, ideas, and solutions to help our business succeed. To that end, we prohibit discrimination and harassment of any type and afford equal employment opportunities to employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other basis protected by local, state, or federal law. Further, we forbid retaliation against any individual who reports, claims, or makes a charge of discrimination or harassment, fraud, unethical conduct, or a violation of our Company policies. To sustain and promote an inclusive culture, we maintain a robust compliance program rooted in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which provides policies and guidance on non-discrimination, anti-harassment, and equal employment opportunities. We require all employees to complete periodic training sessions on various aspects of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies through an annual acknowledgement and certification process. We evaluate ways to enhance awareness of diversity and inclusion on an ongoing basis in an effort to continue improving our approach.
