Overview
 
Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring, developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. Fortress was incorporated in the state of Delaware on June 28, 2006. Fortress develops and commercializes products both within Fortress and through certain of our subsidiary companies, also referred to herein as the “Fortress Companies.” Additionally, the Company recently acquired a controlling interest in National Holdings Corporation, a diversified independent brokerage company (together with its subsidiaries, herein referred to as “NHLD” or “National”). In addition to its internal development programs, the Company leverages its biopharmaceutical business expertise and drug development capabilities and provides funding and management services to help the Fortress Companies achieve their goals. The Company and the Fortress Companies may seek licensings, acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and/or public and private financings to accelerate and provide additional funding to support their research and development programs.
Business Strategy
 
Our business approach is designed for maximum flexibility, allowing us to invest in a broad array of new technologies with clinical and commercial potential. It enables us to move quickly to take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities when necessary, and provides us with a range of options that allow us to select what we believe is the most advantageous corporate or financial structure for each drug candidate. We seek to acquire and invest in drugs, technologies and operating subsidiaries with high growth potential. In 2016, we made significant progress with our above initiatives and believe our novel business approach will provide opportunities to achieve synergies across multiple Fortress Companies.
 
At the end of 2016, in addition to National, we had several consolidated Fortress Companies, some of which contain product licenses, including Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (“Avenue”), Cellvation, Inc. (“Cellvation”), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”), Coronado SO Co. (“Coronado SO”), Helocyte, Inc. (formerly known as DiaVax Biosciences, Inc., “Helocyte”), Journey Medical Corporation (“Journey” or “JMC”), Mustang Bio, Inc. (formerly known as Mustang Therapeutics, Inc., “Mustang”), Escala Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Altamira Biosciences, Inc., “Escala”), and CB Securities Corporation. Caelum Biosciences, Inc. (“Caelum”) and Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc., both consolidated Fortress Companies that also hold product licenses, were formed in January 2017 and March 2017, respectively.
 
The Fortress Companies
 
Avenue Therapeutics, Inc.
 
Avenue was formed as a specialty pharmaceutical company to acquire, license, develop and commercialize products principally for use in the acute/intensive care hospital setting. Avenue’s lead product candidate is an intravenous (“IV”) formulation of tramadol HCl (“IV Tramadol”) for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe post-operative pain. In February 2015, we purchased the exclusive license to IV Tramadol for the U.S. market from Revogenex Ireland Limited (“Revogenex”) and transferred it to Avenue. In December 2016, Avenue received Notices of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for two continuation patent applications covering methods of administration for IV Tramadol; issuance of both patents occurred in February 2017. Avenue also completed an End-of-Phase 2 (EOP) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regarding IV Tramadol. Avenue anticipates initiation of the Phase 3 study for IV Tramadol in 2017. Avenue filed a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC on January 12, 2017. Avenue is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.

among adults and children in the United States. Based on the National Hospital Discharge Survey, there were approximately 2.5 million TBIs in the United States in 2010. There is no approved therapy for the treatment of TBI. The Cellvation therapeutics may reduce the inflammation and secondary injury associated with TBI, representing a novel approach to a condition with significant unmet medical need. Cellvation is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
 
Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc.
 
Checkpoint is an immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel, non-chemotherapy, immune-enhanced combination treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. Checkpoint aims to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing the rights or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-licensing or bringing the technologies to market. Checkpoint is currently developing a portfolio of fully human immuno-oncology targeted antibodies generated in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Marasco, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“Dana-Farber”). The portfolio of antibodies licensed from Dana-Farber includes antibodies targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (“PD-L1”), glucocorticoid-induced TNFR related protein (“GITR”) and carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”) (together, the “Dana-Farber Antibodies”). Checkpoint plans to develop these novel immuno-oncology and checkpoint inhibitor antibodies on their own and in combination with each other, as published literature suggests that combinations of these targets may work synergistically. Checkpoint expects to submit investigational new drug (“IND”) applications for its anti-PD-L1 antibody in 2017 and its anti-GITR and anti-CAIX antibodies in 2018. Checkpoint has also licensed and is developing three oral targeted anti-cancer therapies consisting of an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) mutations, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) protein, BRD4, and an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (“PARP”). Checkpoint submitted an IND application to the FDA for its EGFR inhibitor, which was accepted in August 2016, and the company began a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in September 2016. Checkpoint plans to submit an IND application for its BET inhibitor in 2017 and is currently developing a clinical program for its PARP inhibitor, which is expected to commence in the next 12 months. Checkpoint will additionally seek to add additional immuno-oncology drugs as well as other targeted therapies to create wholly-owned proprietary combinations that leverage the immune system and other complementary mechanisms. Checkpoint is a Delaware corporation and a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress.
 
Coronado SO Co.
 
Coronado SO was formed in March 2014 as an oncology subsidiary. In January 2015, Coronado SO entered into an exclusive license agreement with a third party for a license for a Phase 2, Uracil Topical Cream used in the treatment and prevention of hand-foot syndrome, a common painful side effect of chemotherapeutics. In June 2015, the U.S. FDA accepted specific components of a planned Phase 2 study. Coronado SO is a Delaware corporation and is a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
Cyprium Therapeutics, Inc.
 
Cyprium was formed in March 2017 to develop novel therapies for the treatment of Menkes disease and related copper metabolism disorders. In March 2017, Cyprium and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“NICHD”), part of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), executed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) to advance the clinical development of Phase 3 candidate CUTX-101 (copper histidinate injection) for the treatment of Menkes disease. Cyprium and NICHD also entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement to develop and commercialize AAV-based ATP7A gene therapy for use in combination with CUTX-101 for the treatment of Menkes disease and related copper transport disorders. Cyprium is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
Escala Therapeutics, Inc.
 
Escala is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel agents for the treatment of rare, neglected or orphan disorders. Escala is currently developing N-acetyl-D-mannosamine monohydrate (“ManNAc”), for the treatment of GNE Myopathy (also known as Human Inclusion Body Myopathy, or HIBM), and other disorders, in partnership with the NIH. In July 2015, Escala acquired the NIH’s license and cooperative research and development agreements from New Zealand Pharmaceuticals Limited (“NZP”). NZP will continue to manufacture ManNAc and remain the exclusive global supplier of ManNAc to Escala. ManNAc is currently under investigation in an open label Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of GNE Myopathy. A Phase 1 study to further investigate ManNAc safety and tolerability in a range of kidney disorders (glomerular nephropathies) associated with hyposialylation is ongoing. Escala is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
Helocyte, Inc.
 
Helocyte is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of cancer and infectious disease (and in particular, cytomegalovirus or “CMV”), a common virus that affects people of all ages. The Centers for
 
5


Disease Control estimate that 50% to 80% of Americans are infected with CMV by the age of 40. While the virus is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it can cause severe and life-threatening disease in those with weakened or uneducated immune systems. Patients undergoing allogenic stem cell and solid organ transplantation are at particularly high risk of experiencing complications associated with CMV. Helocyte’s PepVax and Triplex vaccines are engineered to induce a robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to control CMV in transplant recipients. Triplex and PepVax are currently being investigated in multicenter Phase 2 studies for CMV control in stem cell transplant recipients. Helocyte’s Pentamer vaccine is designed to induce a neutralizing antibody response to prevent the transmission of CMV from mother to fetus, the most common congenital infection. There is no approved therapy for the prevention or treatment of congenital CMV. While current antiviral therapies have reduced the rate of CMV disease-related mortality in transplant recipients, such treatments have been linked to increased toxicity, delayed immune reconstitution and late onset of CMV. The Helocyte vaccines can educate the body’s innate immune system to fight CMV. Helocyte is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
 
Journey Medical Corporation
 
Journey was formed in October of 2014 as an innovative company focused on developing, acquiring, licensing and commercializing branded dermatology products. Journey launched four products in 12 months, beginning in October 2015.  Three of those products are under the Journey name, and one is a co-promote agreement. Most recently, Journey launched TargadoxTM, a 50 mg immediate-release doxycycline hyclate coated tablet. Targadox is indicated as adjunctive therapy for severe acne. In 2016, Journey launched Luxamend® Wound Cream and CeracadeTM Skin Emulsion. Journey also has an agreement to co-promote Dermasorb HC for Crown Labs. Journey is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
Mustang Bio, Inc.
 
Mustang is developing novel immunotherapies based on the Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) research of Dr. Stephen Forman and Dr. Christine Browne of City of Hope (“COH”), an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Mustang was formed to help bring this CAR research to as many patients as possible. Mustang, through a research agreement with COH, is developing CARs across multiple cancers, with the initial focus on acute myeloid leukemia and brain cancer. Both of the lead programs are in Phase 1 clinical studies. Mustang believes that harnessing the body’s own immune system to treat cancer is the next generation of cancer therapies that may prove curative across tumor types that have proved resilient to standard pharmacological and biological treatments. A patient case study from the Phase 1 clinical trial of MB-101, a lead development candidate of Mustang for the treatment of glioblastoma, was recently published in the December 29 edition of The New England Journal of Medicine. Mustang is a Delaware corporation and a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress.
 
In a private placement offering that concluded on January 31, 2017, Mustang raised aggregate gross proceeds of $94.5 million, including $39.1 million that was collected during the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with the offering, Mustang paid its placement agent, OPN Capital Markets (“OPN”), the healthcare-related investment banking and research division of National Securities Corporation, $9.5 million or 10%, of which $3.9 million was paid in 2016. Mustang also issued to OPN approximately 1.5 million warrants to purchase Mustang’s common stock, of which 0.6 million warrants were issued in 2016.
 
National Holdings Corporation

Product Candidates held by Fortress
 
In July 2016, Fortress entered into a License Agreement with GeneMedicine, Inc. (“GeneMedicine”) to develop products using Gene Medicine’s oncolytic adenovirus technology. In connection with the license agreement, Fortress agreed to provide GeneMedicine $0.3 million in funding for an 18-month research study in connection with the technology. In October 2016, Fortress paid a fee of $0.1 million to GeneMedicine to initiate the research program.
 
In September 2016, Fortress entered into a Development and License Agreement with Effcon Laboratories, Inc. (“Effcon”) for the extended release formulation of methazolamide. Fortress made an upfront payment to Effcon of $0.2 million. Seven additional milestone payments totaling up to $5.3 million may become payable upon the achievement of certain developmental and sales milestones. Fortress agreed to fund a related development budget of up to $1.6 million.
 
Fortress continues to develop CNDO-109, a lysate (disrupted CTV-1 cells, cell membrane fragments, cell proteins and other cellular components) that activates donor Natural Killer (“NK”) cells. CTV-1 is a leukemic cell line re-classified as a T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (“ALL”). In November 2007, we entered into a license agreement, since amended, with University College London Business PLC (“UCLB”) under which we received an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize CNDO-109 to activate NK cells for the treatment of cancer-related and other conditions and a non-exclusive license to certain clinical data solely for use in the IND for CNDO-109. In consideration of the license from UCLB, we will be required to make future milestone payments totaling up to approximately $22.0 million contingent upon the achievement of various regulatory milestones and, in the event that CNDO-109 is commercialized, we may be obligated to pay to UCLB royalties ranging from 3% to 5% of net sales of the product or, if commercialized by a sublicensee, a percentage of certain consideration we receive from such sublicensee (ranging from 20%-30% of such consideration depending on the stage of clinical development at the time of the sublicense). The manufacturing process for CNDO-109 activated NK cells is currently under development. We have produced a master cell bank and a working cell bank of CTV-1 cells in collaboration with BioReliance Corp, and we have contracted with Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC and WuXi AppTec for services related to development, manufacture and testing services. We have sponsored a Phase 1/2 study in patients with AML who were in their first complete remission (“CR1”) and who were at a high risk of relapsing. This study has completed enrollment but is remaining open to follow the long-term relapse-free survival status of patients.
 
Intellectual Property

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our and, in some cases, our subsidiaries’ product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where
 
7


appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our and, in some cases, our subsidiaries’ product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our and our subsidiaries’ management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we and our subsidiaries currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we and our subsidiaries require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
Under the GeneMedicine license, we have an exclusive, worldwide license under three patent families assigned to GeneMedicine to develop and commercialize certain compositions of matter directed to (i) recombinant vectors comprising a transcriptional regulatory sequence operably linked to a therapeutic transgene, such as tumor suppressor gene, cytotoxic gene, anti-angiogenic gene and the like; (ii) methods of co-expression of IL-12 and IL-23; and (iii) a method of enhancing transduction efficiency of a recombinant adenovirus expression vector into a tumor cell in a solid tumor.  The foregoing three patent families include counterparts in Europe and selected Asian jurisdictions, scheduled to expire in 2024, 2028 and 2026, respectively.  The granted U.S. counterparts of the first two patent families enjoy patent term adjustments, which extend the terms of these patents out to 2027 and 2030, respectively, without taking into account any further potential extensions under patent term restoration provisions of U.S. patent laws.
 
With respect to CNDO-109, we have exclusive rights to International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2006/000960 and all pending United States and foreign counterpart applications including granted U.S. Patents No. 8,257,970 and 8,637,308 and the corresponding national phase applications granted in Australia and India and filed in Canada, Europe and Japan, directed to the stimulation of NK cells and related CNDO-109 compositions and methods including methods for the treatment of cancer and other conditions. This patent family has been in-licensed on an exclusive basis from UCLB. The CNDO-109 patent has an expiration date of January 2029 in the absence of any patent term extension. By way of an amendment to the license agreement with UCLB, we also have exclusive rights to International Application No. PCT/GB2010/051135 and all pending United States and foreign counterpart applications including pending United States Patent Application Serial No. 12/833,694 and the corresponding national phase applications filed in Europe, Brazil, China, Israel, Singapore and South Africa, directed to the preservation of activated NK cells and related compositions and methods. The CNDO-109 patents that may issue from the former patent family would expire in July 2030 in the absence of any patent term extension. The amendment includes rights to certain additional confidential technologies as well.
 
National owns the following federally registered marks: vFinance, Inc.®, vFinance.com, Inc. ®, AngelSearch® and Gilman Ciocia®.
 
Competition - Fortress
 
We and our subsidiaries operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our and our subsidiaries’ competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us and our subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
Each cancer indication for which we or any of our subsidiaries may develop products has a number of established therapies with which our candidates will compete. With respect to CNDO-109, most major pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs, including both therapies with traditional, as well as novel, mechanisms of action. Some of the anticipated competitor treatments for AML include Genzyme Corporation’s Clolar (clofarabine), currently approved as a treatment for ALL, Eisai Corporation’s Dacogen (decitabine), currently approved as a treatment for Myelodysplastic Syndromes (“MDS”), Celgene Corporation’s Vidaza (azacitidine), currently approved as treatments for MDS, and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s vosaroxin and Ambit Bioscience, Inc.’s quizartinib, which are currently being developed as a treatment for AML, any or all of which could change the treatment paradigm of acute leukemia. Each of these compounds is further along in clinical development than is the CDNO-109 activated NK cell product.

Competition - National
 
National is engaged in a highly competitive business. With respect to one or more aspects of its business, National’s competitors include member organizations of the New York Stock Exchange and other registered securities exchanges in the United States and Canada, the U.K., Europe and members of FINRA. Many of these organizations have substantially greater personnel and financial resources and more sales offices than National. Discount brokerage firms affiliated with commercial banks provide additional competition, as well as companies that provide electronic on-line trading. In many instances, National is also competing directly for customer funds with investment opportunities offered by real estate, insurance, banking, and savings and loans industries.
 
The securities industry has become considerably more concentrated and more competitive since National was founded, as numerous securities firms have either ceased operations or have been acquired by or merged into other firms. In addition, companies not engaged primarily in the securities business, but with substantial financial resources, have acquired leading securities firms. These developments have increased competition from firms with greater capital resources than those of National.
 
Since the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, commercial banks and thrift institutions have been able to engage in traditional brokerage and investment banking services, thus increasing competition in the securities industry and potentially increasing the rate of consolidation in the securities industry.
 
National also competes with other securities firms for successful sales representatives, securities traders and investment bankers. Competition for qualified employees and independent contractors in the financial services industry is intense. National’s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and independent contractors and to retain and motivate its existing employees and independent contractors.
 
In addition, National’s tax preparation business is also subject to extensive competition. National competes with national tax return preparers such as H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, and Liberty Tax, among others. The remainder of the tax preparation industry is highly fragmented and includes regional tax preparation services, accountants, attorneys, small independently owned companies, and financial service institutions that prepare tax returns as ancillary parts of their business. To a much lesser extent, National competes with the on-line and software self-preparer market.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval - Fortress
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we and our subsidiaries are developing.
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical (drug and biologic) products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product-development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Product Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9



• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA/ BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA/BLA.
--+----------------------------------------

 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
 
Products for somatic cell therapy are derived from a variety of biologic sources, including directly harvested autologous, allogeneic, or cultured cell lines. Product safety requires that these sources be well characterized, uniform, and not contaminated with hazardous adventitious agents. Also, cells directly from humans pose additional product safety issues. Because of the complex nature of these products, a controlled, reproducible manufacturing process and facility are required and relied on to produce a uniform product. The degree of reliance on a controlled process varies depending on the nature of the product. Because complete chemical characterization of a biologic product is not feasible for quality control, the testing of the biologic potency receives particular attention and is costly.
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB or ethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to administer and conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from these trials. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards could adversely impact the subject product development program. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is usually introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA/BLA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be requested by the FDA as a
 
10


condition of approval.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
United States Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA/BLA requesting approval to market the product.
 
The NDA/BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA/BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA/BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, our subsidiaries or our suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which we or our subsidiaries receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.
 
The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA or BLA. In June 2012, we were notified by the FDA that CNDO-109 was granted orphan drug designation and in September 2012, the USPTO issued the first U.S. patent covering CNDO-109. If CNDO-109 is commercialized, we will be obligated to pay UCLB annual royalties based upon the net sales of product or if we sublicense CNDO-109, a portion of sub-licensing revenue we receive, if any.
 
If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such
 
11


designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another person if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. If the FDA approves someone else’s application for the same drug that has orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its FDA approval for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs and BLAs or supplements to NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the treatment is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a product if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within a specific time frame.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our and our subsidiaries’ activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we and our subsidiaries receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us and our subsidiaries to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act.
International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Government Regulation and Supervision - National
 
The securities industry, the Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries, and National’s investment adviser businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, FINRA, NFA, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. The principal purpose of these regulations is the protection of customers and the securities markets. The SEC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the federal securities laws. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA, that adopt rules, subject to approval by the SEC, which govern their members and conduct periodic examinations of member firms' operations. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the states in which they are registered. All of the Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and members of FINRA. They are licensed to conduct activities as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
 
12


In addition, as registered broker-dealers and members of FINRA, the Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries are subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 (“Rule 15c3-1”), which is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer and requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. Net capital is defined as the net worth of a broker-dealer subject to certain adjustments. In computing net capital, various adjustments are made to net worth that exclude assets not readily convertible into cash. Additionally, the regulations require that certain assets, such as a broker-dealer's position in securities, be valued in a conservative manner so as to avoid overstating of the broker-dealer's net capital.
 
National Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1, which, among other things, requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. In February 2015, pursuant to a directive form FINRA, National Securities reverted back to using the alternative method of computing net capital from the aggregate indebtedness method. At September 30, 2016, National Securities had net capital of $6.2 million which was $6.0 million in excess of its required net capital of $250,000. National Securities is exempt from the provisions of Rule 15c-3-3 since it is an introducing broker-dealer that clears all transactions on a fully disclosed basis and promptly transmits all customer funds and securities to clearing brokers. Calculations of net capital and claimed exemptions are reviewed by an independent audit firm on an annual basis.
 
vFinance Investments is also subject to Rule 15c3-1, which, among other things, requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined in Rule 15c3-1, shall not exceed 15 to 1. At September 30, 2016, vFinance Investments had net capital of $2.2 million which was $1.2 million in excess of its required net capital of $1.0 million. vFinance Investments ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.8 to 1. vFinance Investments is exempt from the provisions of Rule 15c-3-3 since it is an introducing broker-dealer that clears all transactions on a fully disclosed basis and promptly transmits all customer funds and securities to clearing brokers. Calculations of net capital and claimed exemptions are reviewed by an independent audit firm on an annual basis.
 
National’s tax preparation business is also subject to extensive regulation. Federal legislation requires income tax return preparers to, among other things, register as a tax preparer, set forth their signatures and identification numbers on all tax returns prepared by them, and retain all tax returns prepared by them for three years. Federal laws also subject income tax preparers to accuracy-related penalties in connection with the preparation of income tax returns. Preparers may be prohibited from further acting as income tax return preparers if they continuously and repeatedly engage in specified misconduct. In addition, authorized IRS e-filer providers are required to comply with certain rules and regulations, as per IRS Publication 1345 and other notices of the IRS applicable to e-filing.
 
IRS regulations require among other things, that all tax return preparers use a Preparer Tax Identification Number (“PTIN”) as their identifying number on federal tax returns filed after December 31, 2010; require all tax return preparers to be authorized to practice before the IRS as a prerequisite to obtaining or renewing a PTIN; causing all previous issued PTIN’s to expire on December 31, 2010 unless properly renewed; allowing the IRS to conduct tax compliance checks on tax return preparers; and defining the individuals who are considered “tax return preparers” for the PTIN applicants. The IRS also conducts background checks on PTIN applicants.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Trade Commission regulations require National to adopt and disclose customer privacy policies.
