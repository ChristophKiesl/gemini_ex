Item 1.    Business  
Introductory Note
The following describes the business of Cannae Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Except where otherwise noted, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” "Cannae", "Cannae Holdings", or the "Company," are to Cannae Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together.
Company Background
On November 17, 2017, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“FNF”, NYSE: FNF) redeemed each outstanding share of its FNF Ventures ("FNFV") Group common stock, par value $0.0001, for one share of common stock, par value $0.0001, of a newly formed entity, Cannae (the "Split-Off"). In conjunction with the Split-Off, FNF contributed to us its portfolio of investments unrelated to its primary insurance and real estate operations, which included majority and minority equity investment stakes in a number of entities and certain fixed income investments. On November 20, 2017, Cannae common stock began “regular-way” trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the “CNNE” stock symbol.
Description of Business
We are engaged in actively managing and operating a group of companies and investments, as well as making additional majority and minority equity portfolio investments in businesses, in order to achieve superior financial performance and maximize the value of these assets. Our primary investments as of December 31, 2020 include our minority ownership interests in The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation ("Dun & Bradstreet" or "D&B", NYSE: DNB), Ceridian HCM Holding, Inc. ("Ceridian", NYSE: CDAY), Optimal Blue Holdco, LLC ("Optimal Blue") and AmeriLife Group, LLC ("AmeriLife"); majority equity ownership stakes in O'Charley's Holdings, LLC ("O'Charley's") and 99 Restaurants Holdings, LLC ("99 Restaurants"); and various other equity and debt investments primarily in the real estate, financial services and healthcare technology industries. 
The Company conducts its business through our wholly-owned subsidiary Cannae Holdings, LLC ("Cannae LLC"), a Delaware limited liability company. The Company’s board of directors ("Board") oversees the management of the Company, Cannae LLC and its businesses, and the performance of Trasimene Capital Management, LLC (“Trasimene” or our “Manager”). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the Company transitioned to an externally managed structure (such externalization of certain management functions, the “Externalization”). In connection with the Externalization, the Company, Cannae LLC, and our Manager entered into a Management Services Agreement dated as of August 27, 2019, as amended on January 27, 2021 (as amended, the “Management Services Agreement”).
We believe our operating structure provides our investors with a compelling opportunity to participate in the acquisition and growth of businesses by a world-class management team. Fundamentally, the Company seeks to take meaningful equity ownership stakes where we have an ability to control or significantly influence quality companies that are well-positioned in their respective industries, run by best-in-class management teams and that operate in industries that have attractive organic and acquired growth opportunities. Led by William P. Foley II ("Bill Foley") and facilitated through our Manager, we leverage our management team's operational expertise, long-term relationships and industry connections and capital sourcing capabilities to identify, structure and execute on investments with these characteristics. 
Our management team has a proven track record of growing industry-leading companies and we actively interact with and support management of our portfolio companies, directly or through our board of directors, to ultimately provide value for our shareholders. Bill Foley-led management teams are responsible for the growth of publicly traded companies such as FNF, Black Knight, Inc. ("Black Knight", NYSE: BKI), Ceridian, D&B and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE: FIS), which collectively had a market capitalization of approximately $139 billion as of December 31, 2020. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had the following reportable segments:
Dun & Bradstreet. This segment consists of our 18.1% ownership interest in D&B. Dun & Bradstreet is a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics. Its mission is to deliver a global network of trust, enabling clients to transform uncertainty into confidence, risk into opportunity and potential into prosperity. Clients embed D&B's trusted, end-to-end solutions into their daily workflows to enhance salesforce productivity, gain visibility into key markets, inform commercial credit decisions and confirm that suppliers are financially viable and compliant with laws and regulations. Dun & Bradstreet's solutions support its clients’ mission critical business operations by providing proprietary and curated data and analytics to help drive informed decisions and improved outcomes.
Dun & Bradstreet is differentiated by the scale, depth, diversity and accuracy of its constantly expanding business database that contains comprehensive information on more than 420 million total businesses as of December 31, 2020. Access to longitudinal curated data is critical for global commerce, and with only a small percentage of the world’s businesses filing 
public financial statements, D&B data is a trusted source for reliable information about both public and private businesses. By building such a set of data over time, D&B was able to establish a unique identifier that creates a single thread connecting related corporate entities allowing its clients to form a holistic view of an enterprise. This unique identifier, which D&B refers to as the D-U-N-S Number, is a corporate ‘‘fingerprint’’ or ‘‘Social Security Number’’ of businesses. D&B believes that it is the only scale provider to possess both worldwide commercial credit data and comprehensive public records data that are linked together by a unique identifier allowing for an accurate assessment of public and private businesses globally. D&B generates its revenue primarily through subscription-based contractual arrangements that it enters into with its clients to provide data, analytics and analytics-related services either individually, or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services. These arrangements occasionally include offerings from more than one business unit to the same client.
We account for our investment in Dun & Bradstreet using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours.
Optimal Blue. This segment consists of our 20.0% ownership interest in Optimal Blue. Optimal Blue is a leading provider of secondary market solutions and actionable data services. They operate a software-as-a-service, subscription-based mortgage marketplace, which supports a network of originators and investors in the residential mortgage market. The marketplace provides a broad set of critical functions utilized by banks, credit unions and mortgage brokerage companies throughout the mortgage processing life cycle. 
We account for our investment in Optimal Blue using the equity method of accounting; therefore, its results of operations do not consolidate into ours. 
Restaurant Group.  This segment consists of the operations of O'Charley's, 99 Restaurants, Legendary Baking Holdings I, LLC ("Legendary Baking") and VIBSQ Holdco, LLC ("VIBSQ") in which we have 65.4%, 88.5%, 100% and 100% equity ownership interests, respectively. O'Charley's, 99 Restaurants, Legendary Baking, VIBSQ and their affiliates are the owners and operators of the O'Charley's restaurant concept, Ninety Nine Restaurants restaurant concept, Legendary Baking bakery and the Village Inn and Bakers Square restaurant concepts. 
Corporate and Other.  This aggregation of nonreportable operating segments consists of our share in the operations of controlled and uncontrolled portfolio companies including our 9.5% ownership interest in Ceridian, 20.0% ownership interest in AmeriLife, 21.7% ownership interest in Coding Solutions Topco, Inc. ("CorroHealth"), 49.2% ownership interest in a joint venture (the "Senator JV") with affiliates of Senator Investment Group, LP ("Senator"), 22.5% voting equity interest in preferred stock of QOMPLX, Inc. ("QOMPLX"), 30.5% equity interest in Triple Tree Holdings, LLC ("Triple Tree"), majority-owned real estate and resort development businesses ("Cannae RE"), interests in sponsors of special purpose acquisition companies ("SPACs") and other various minority equity and debt investments. 
Ceridian is a global human capital management (“HCM”) software company that offers a broad range of services and software designed to help employers more effectively manage employment processes, such as payroll, payroll-related tax filing, human resource information systems, employee self-service, time and labor management, employee assistance programs, and recruitment and applicant screening. Ceridian's technology-based services are typically provided through long-term customer relationships that are anticipated to result in a high level of recurring revenue. 
AmeriLife is a leader in marketing and distributing life, health, and retirement solutions.
CorroHealth (formerly known as Coding Solutions) is a joint venture that has various medical coding technology platforms and back office functions supporting the health care revenue and billing cycles and focuses on acquiring and operating synergistic health care services companies in the provider and payer space. 
The Senator JV is an investment fund in partnership with Senator designed to provide a mechanism to allow us and Senator to jointly invest in CoreLogic, Inc. ("CoreLogic"). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), we exited our investment in CoreLogic completely and have no further material interest in the Senator JV. See further discussion under the header Recent Developments in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.
QOMPLX, formerly Fractal Industries, Inc., is an intelligent decision and analytics platform used by businesses for modeling and planning. QOMPLX offers an enterprise operating system and application platforms with capabilities ranging from data handling, analytics, and reporting to advanced algorithms, simulations, and machine learning, which have business uses for cybersecurity, insurance underwriting and quantitative finance.
Triple Tree is an independent, research-driven investment banking firm focused on mergers and acquisitions, financial restructuring, and principal investing services for innovative, high-growth businesses in the healthcare industry. 
Cannae RE and its subsidiaries operate and invest in golf and real estate properties and develop, manage and operate residential and recreational properties, including a 1,800-acre ranch-style luxury resort and residential community in Oregon and an 18-hole championship golf facility in Idaho. 
Refer to Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information on recent results of operations and transactions and other activity of our operating segments.
Strategy
Our strategy for the Company is to continue our activities with respect to the above described business investments to achieve superior financial performance, maximize and ultimately monetize the value of those assets and to continue to pursue similar investments in businesses and to grow and achieve superior financial performance with respect to such newly acquired businesses.
Dun & Bradstreet. We believe that Dun & Bradstreet has an attractive business model that is underpinned by highly recurring, diversified revenues, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and strong free cash flow. The proprietary and embedded nature of its data and analytics solutions and the integral role that D&B plays in its clients’ decision-making processes have translated into high client retention and revenue visibility. D&B has had relationships with 21 of its top 25 clients by revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 for more than 20 years, which reflects how deeply embedded D&B is in its clients daily workflows and decisioning processes. For both 2020 and 2019, D&B's annual revenue retention rate, reflecting the percentage of prior year revenue from its clients who were retained in the current year, was 96%. Dun & Bradstreet also benefits from strong operating leverage given its centralized database and solutions, which allows it to generate strong contribution margins and free cash flow.
Subsequent to our investment in D&B in the first quarter of 2019, D&B quickly began implementing changes to address operational and execution issues at D&B that led to stagnant revenue growth and declining profitability over the last decade. The new investors in D&B immediately brought in a new senior leadership team, which commenced a comprehensive transformation to improve and revitalize D&B's business for long-term success. The new senior leadership team saw significant opportunity to create value by transforming the organization and improving the platform with new business unit leaders, enhanced technology and data, solution innovation and a client-centric go-to-market strategy.
D&B's transformation strategy is based on a proven playbook of enhancing stockholder value through organizational re-alignment and re-investment. As of December 31, 2020, these initiatives have resulted in approximately $242.0 million of net annualized run-rate savings, and D&B believes there are incremental opportunities to further rationalize its cost structure. In light of the changes that have been made or identified by D&B's management team, we believe D&B is well-positioned to execute on its strategies of driving stockholder value through consistent revenue growth, managing cost initiatives and innovating and improving the way it adds value and solves the increasingly challenging and complex needs of its clients.
Restaurant Group. Our restaurant operations are focused in the family dining and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry. The Restaurant Group's strategy is to achieve long-term profit growth and drive increases in same store sales and guest counts. We have a highly experienced management team that is focused on enhancing the guest experience at our restaurants and building team member engagement. We also utilize a shared service platform that takes advantage of the combined back-office synergies of our restaurant operating companies. Our goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet for our Restaurant Group to provide stability in all operating environments. 
On January 27, 2020, American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC ("Blue Ribbon") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Blue Ribbon Reorganization"). The Blue Ribbon Reorganization did not involve or affect the operations of O’Charley’s or 99 Restaurants, which are not part of Blue Ribbon. 
As a result of the Blue Ribbon Reorganization, we deconsolidated Blue Ribbon as of January 27, 2020 because the bankruptcy court and committee of creditors formed are deemed to have control of Blue Ribbon. On July 10, 2020, Blue Ribbon filed its Debtor's Chapter 11 Plan (the "Chapter 11 Plan") with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"). 
On October 2, 2020, the Chapter 11 Plan became effective and Blue Ribbon emerged from bankruptcy as a set of reorganized companies, including VIBSQ and Legendary Baking. Upon Blue Ribbon's emergence from bankruptcy, we acquired the assets and uncompromised liabilities of Legendary Baking and VIBSQ in exchange for $15.5 million of the outstanding balance under our debtor in possession loan (the "DIP Loan") with Blue Ribbon. Subsequent to Blue Ribbon's emergence from bankruptcy, we own 100% of the equity of VIBSQ and Legendary Baking. Refer to Note I to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for further discussion of our accounting for our acquisition of VIBSQ and Legendary Baking upon their emergence from bankruptcy.
We believe the Blue Ribbon Reorganization will facilitate the Legendary Baking, Village Inn and Bakers Square brands' evolution to a healthy core of restaurants and bakery operations and support an approach to the brands that is most beneficial for all stakeholders.
Acquisitions, Dispositions, Minority Owned Operating Affiliates and Financings. Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy and dispositions are an important aspect of our strategy of rebalancing our portfolio of companies and providing our shareholders with prudent risk-based returns on investment. On an ongoing basis, with assistance from our Manager and outside advisors, we actively evaluate possible transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions of business units and operating assets and business combination transactions.
In the future, we may seek to sell certain investments or other assets to increase our liquidity. Further, we may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to, or synergistic with, our current operating segments. In the past we have obtained majority and minority investments in entities and securities where we see the potential to achieve above market returns. 
There can be no assurance that any suitable opportunities will arise or that any particular transaction will be completed. We have made a number of acquisitions and dispositions over the past several years to strengthen and expand our investment base and expand the service offerings and customer bases of our businesses, to expand into other businesses or where we otherwise saw value, and to monetize investments in assets and businesses.
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies. In 2020 and early 2021, we made investments in the sponsors of, and forward purchase commitments to purchase equity of, three SPACs, which are companies formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. See discussion under the header Forward Purchases of Equity of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for further information on our investment commitments. The following summarizes the Company's equity commitments by entity:

SPAC | Ticker | IPO Date | Cannae Equity Purchase Commitment (1)
Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp. II ("FTAC II") | BFT | August 21, 2020 | $ | 500.0
Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp. ("FTAC") | WPF | May 29, 2020 | 400.0 | 
Trebia Acquisition Corp. ("Trebia") | TREB | June 19, 2020 | 75.0 | 

_____________________________________
(1) Represents Cannae's commitment as of the date of this Annual Report to purchase equity of the listed SPAC and its target upon consummation of each SPACs initial business combination
SPACs have proven to be not only an efficient means for private entities to go public, but also a unique opportunity for companies to partner with sponsors who provide invaluable industry, operational and capital market experience. We believe our investments in the SPACs sponsored or co-sponsored by Trasimene and led by our chairman Bill Foley provide an opportunity for Cannae to participate in the growth and transformation of businesses with compelling characteristics similar to other of our management team’s prior investments, including Dun & Bradstreet, FNF, Black Knight and Ceridian. The sponsors intend to focus on prospective target businesses that have unseen potential for revenue growth and/or operating margin expansion with high recurring revenue and cash flow, defensible intellectual property and strong market positions within their industries. 
On December 7, 2020, FTAC II entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with Paysafe Limited (“Paysafe”), a leading integrated payments platform (the "FTAC II Paysafe Merger"). Upon closing of the FTAC II Paysafe Merger, the newly combined company will operate as Paysafe and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PSFE. The FTAC II Paysafe Merger reflects an implied pro-forma enterprise value for Paysafe of approximately $9.0 billion. The FTAC II Paysafe Merger will be funded with the cash held in trust at FTAC II, forward purchase commitments, private investment in public equity ("PIPE") commitments and equity of Paysafe. Completion of the FTAC II Paysafe Merger is subject to approval by FTAC II stockholders, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with the transaction, and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The FTAC II Paysafe Merger is expected to close in the first half of 2021.
On December 7, 2020, Cannae entered into an agreement to purchase 35,000,000 shares of Paysafe for $350.0 million as part of a subscription to the PIPE (the "Paysafe Subscription Agreement"). Paysafe has agreed to pay us a placement fee of $5.6 million as consideration for our subscription. Upon consummation of the FTAC II Paysafe Merger, our aggregate investment in Paysafe is expected to be $504.7 million in Paysafe, inclusive of Cannae's investment commitments under our forward purchase agreement with FTAC II (the "FTAC II FPA") and Paysafe Subscription Agreement and our prior $4.7 million investment in the sponsor of FTAC II, and we are expected to receive 54,290,000 shares of common stock of Paysafe which represents approximately 7.5% of the pro forma outstanding common equity of Paysafe and 8,134,067 warrants to purchase one share of Paysafe common stock at $11.50 per share.
Further information on the FTAC II Paysafe Merger can be found in Paysafe's Registration Statement on Form F-4 filed with the SEC on December 21, 2020 and amended on February 1, 2021.
On January 25, 2021, FTAC entered into a business combination agreement with Alight Solutions ("Alight"), a leading cloud-based provider of integrated digital human capital and business solutions (the "FTAC Alight Business Combination"). Under the terms of the FTAC Alight Business Combination, FTAC will combine with Alight and Alight will become a publicly traded entity under the name “Alight, Inc.” and symbol ALIT. The FTAC Alight Business Combination reflects an implied pro-forma enterprise value for Alight of approximately $7.3 billion at closing. The FTAC Alight Business Combination will be funded with the cash held in trust at FTAC, forward purchase commitments, PIPE commitments and equity of Alight. Completion of the FTAC Alight Business Combination is subject to approval by FTAC stockholders, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with the transaction, and other customary closing conditions of SPAC business combinations, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The FTAC Alight Business Combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.
On January 25, 2021, Cannae entered into an agreement to purchase 25,000,000 shares of Alight for $250.0 million as part of a subscription to the PIPE (the "Alight Subscription Agreement"). Alight has agreed to pay us a placement fee of $6.3 million as consideration for our subscription. Upon consummation of the FTAC Alight Business Combination, our aggregate investment in Alight is expected to be $404.5 million, inclusive of Cannae's investment commitments under our forward purchase agreement with FTAC (the "FTAC FPA") and Alight Subscription Agreement and our previous $4.5 million investment in a sponsor of FTAC, and we are expected to receive 44,639,500 shares of common stock of Alight which represents approximately 8.6% of the pro forma outstanding common equity of Alight and 8,026,666 warrants to purchase one share of Alight common stock at $11.50 per share.
Further information on the FTAC Alight Business Combination can be found in FTAC's current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 27, 2021.
Business Trends and Conditions
Dun & Bradstreet. Businesses rely on business-to-business data and analytics providers to extract data-driven insights and make better decisions. For example, in commercial lending and trade credit, the scarcity of readily available credit history makes the extension of credit a time-consuming and imprecise process. In procurement, businesses face increasingly complex and global supply chains, making the assessment of compliance and viability of all suppliers prohibitively difficult and expensive if not conducted effectively. In sales and marketing, businesses have benefited from the proliferation of customer relationship management, Marketing Automation and Sales Acceleration tools designed to help identify, track and improve both customer management and prospecting growth activities. While these tools are helping to fill sales funnels and improve the progression of opportunities, key challenges remain in salesforce productivity, effective client segmentation and marketing campaign activation. Common stumbling blocks include incorrect, or outdated, contact information, duplicated or inaccurate firmographic data and a lack of synchronization between the various platforms in the marketing technology ecosystem.
D&B helps its clients solve these mission critical business problems. D&B believes the total addressable market (‘‘TAM’’) in which it operates is large, growing and significantly underpenetrated. D&B participates in the big data and analytics software market, as defined by Interactive Data Corporation, or IDC, which represents a collection of software markets that functionally address decision support and decision automation. This market includes business intelligence and analytics tools, analytic data management and integration platforms and analytics and performance management applications. Within the broader market of data and analytics solutions, D&B serves a number of different markets, including the commercial credit data, sales and marketing data and Governance, Risk and Compliance ("GRC") markets to provide clients with decisioning support and automation. As D&B continues to drive innovation in its solutions, it expects to address a greater portion of this TAM as new use cases for its data assets and analytical capabilities are introduced.
D&B believes there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment generating additional growth in D&B's TAM and increasing the demand for its solutions, including growing recognition by business of the value of analytics and data-informed business decisioning, growth in data creation and applications driven by the proliferation of new technologies with new data sets and applications, advances in analytical capabilities that are unlocking the value of data, and heightened compliance requirements in the regulatory environment for business driven by the growth of new technologies.
Restaurant Group. The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns; changes in general economic conditions; public safety conditions or concerns; demographic trends; weather conditions; the cost of food products, labor, energy and other operating costs; and governmental regulations. Higher labor costs due to state and local minimum wage increases and shopping pattern shifts to e-commerce and “ready to eat” grocery and convenience stores have had a negative impact on restaurant performance, particularly in the casual and family dining restaurants in which the company operates.
The restaurant industry is also characterized by high capital investments for new restaurants and relatively high fixed or semi-variable restaurant operating expenses.  Because of the high fixed and semi-variable expenses, changes in sales in existing restaurants are generally expected to significantly affect restaurant profitability because many restaurant costs and expenses are not expected to change at the same rate as sales. The most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and 
beverage are beef, seafood, poultry, and dairy, which accounted for approximately half of our overall cost of food and beverage in the past. Generally, temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to guests; however, in the past, we have adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature.
Average weekly sales per restaurant are typically higher in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters, and we typically generate a disproportionate share of our earnings from operations in the first and fourth quarters. Holidays, severe weather and other disruptive conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. 
Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors that are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.
COVID-19. In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a national health emergency in the United States and worldwide. The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. The Company has been closely monitoring developments related to COVID-19 and its impacts to our portfolio of investments and financial markets. We are working with management of our subsidiaries to evaluate business-specific risks and respond to any financial and operational disruptions. At the holding company level, we believe our operating model, low financial leverage and access to capital uniquely positions us to weather economic disruptions. See further discussion of our financial resources in the Liquidity and Capital Resources subsection in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.
As a result of the unprecedented social restrictions related to COVID-19, our Restaurant Group brands experienced a significant reduction in guest counts beginning in the last two weeks of March 2020 and continuing through the end of the year. In response to the outbreak and these changing conditions, our Restaurant Group brands closed the dining rooms in substantially all of our restaurants in late March 2020 with substantially all remaining closed to dine in customers through early May 2020. During this time, most of our restaurants we were solely operating to-go and delivery services in the jurisdictions where government regulations permit restaurants to continue to operate and where the guest demand made such operations sustainable. We temporarily closed certain restaurants, modified work hours for our Restaurant Group employees and identified and implemented cost savings measures throughout our Restaurant Group operations. 
Timing of reopening stores and resulting guest traffic has varied by jurisdiction. In the second half of 2020, our Restaurant Group experienced a gradual increase in guest traffic and revenues compared to the first half of 2020; however, the volume of customers visiting our stores has remained below our historical levels. We have seen an increase in revenues from to-go and delivery sales from historical experience; however, comparable store sales across all of our restaurant brands remained depressed compared to previous years. 
We have been in discussions with our Restaurant Group businesses’ major suppliers, and during the COVID-19 outbreak we have not experienced and do not currently expect to experience material disruptions in our supply chain. 
The COVID-19 outbreak and these responses have affected and are projected to continue to adversely affect our Restaurant Group brands' guest traffic, sales and operating costs. See further discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our Restaurant Group in the Results of Operations subsection in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.
See Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for further discussion of risk factors related to COVID-19.
Competition
Dun & Bradstreet. Dun & Bradstreet primarily competes on the basis of differentiated data sets, analytical capabilities, solutions, client relationships, innovation and price. D&B believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories across its business segments. D&B's competitors vary based on the client size and geographical market that its solutions cover.
For Dun & Bradstreet's finance and risk solutions segment, its competition generally varies by client size. D&B has a leading presence in the enterprise market as clients place a high degree of value on our best-in-class commercial credit database to inform their critical decisions around the extension of credit. D&B’s main competitors in the enterprise and mid-market include Bureau van Dijk (owned by Moody’s Corporation) in Europe and Equifax and Experian in North America. In the small and mid-size company market, commercial credit health becomes increasingly tied to consumer credit health. D&B's competition in this market generally includes Equifax, Experian and other consumer credit providers that offer commercial data. Additionally, there is a fragmented tail of low cost, vertical and regionally focused point solutions in this market that may be attractive to certain clients, but lack the scale and coverage breadth to compete holistically.
For Dun & Bradstreet's sales and marketing solutions segment, its competition has historically been very fragmented with many players offering varying levels of data quantity and quality, and with data being collected in ways that may cross ethical and privacy boundaries. Dun & Bradstreet strives to protect the data and privacy of its clients and to maintain the highest standards in the ethical acquisition, aggregation, curation and delivery of data. D&B's direct competitors vary depending on use cases, such as market segmentation, digital marketing lead generation, lead enrichment, sales effectiveness and data management. In the market for contact data, D&B's competition generally includes ZoomInfo and a few consultancies building 
bespoke solutions. For other sales and marketing solutions such as customer data platform, visitor intelligence, audience targeting and intent data, D&B faces a number of smaller competitors.
Overall, outside North America, D&B's competitive environment varies by region and country, and can be significantly impacted by the legislative actions of local governments, availability of data and local business preferences. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, D&B's direct competition for its finance and risk solutions segment is primarily from Bureau van Dijk, Creditsafe and Experian. Additionally, in D&B's sales and marketing solutions segment, the landscape in these markets is both localized and fragmented, where numerous local players of varying sizes compete for business. In Asia Pacific, D&B faces competition in its finance and risk solutions segment from a mix of local and global providers. D&B competes with Sinotrust International Information & Consulting (Beijing) Co., Ltd., in China and local competitors in India. In addition, as in the United Kingdom, D&B's sales and marketing solutions landscape throughout Asia is localized and fragmented.
Restaurant Group. The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes. Competition for our restaurant brands varies by location. In general, our restaurant brands compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. Restaurants are increasingly competing with grocery stores who are expanding their offerings of quick serve, ready-made meals and meal kits and with meal kit delivery services, which have increased market share over the last couple years. We expect to continue to compete in these areas.
Competitive Strengths
Proven management team.  Our Board and executive management team, led by Bill Foley, has a proven track record of investment identification and management. Bill Foley has led the creation of several multi-billion dollar companies with hundreds of acquisitions across diverse platforms, including, FNF, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Black Knight, Ceridian, D&B and FGL Holdings, Inc. Our Board and executive management's breadth of knowledge of capital markets allows us to identify companies and strategic assets with attractive value propositions, to structure investments to maximize their value, and to return the value created to shareholders. We believe the Externalization under the Management Services Agreement will enhance our executive management team’s ability to provide these services.
Intellectual Property
Dun & Bradstreet. D&B owns and controls various intellectual property rights, such as trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and applications to the foregoing. These rights, in the aggregate, are of material importance to Dun & Bradstreet's business. D&B believes that the Dun & Bradstreet name and related tradenames, marks and logos are also of material importance to its business. Dun & Bradstreet is licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by it. Dun & Bradstreet's trademarks, service marks, databases, software, copyrights, patents, patent applications and other intellectual property are proprietary and accordingly it relies on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, etc.) and contract and liability safeguards for protecting them throughout the world.
Dun & Bradstreet owns patents and patent applications both in the U.S. and in other selected countries. The patents and patent applications include claims, which pertain to certain technologies and inventions that D&B has determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection. The protection of its innovative technology and inventions, such as its proprietary methods for data curation and identity resolution, through the filing of patent applications, is part of Dun & Bradstreet's business strategy. Filing of patent applications may or may not provide Dun & Bradstreet with a dominant position in the fields of technology. However, these patents and/or patent applications may provide Dun & Bradstreet with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third-parties and later asserted against it. Where appropriate, Dun & Bradstreet may also consider asserting or cross-licensing its patents.
Restaurant Group. We regard our Restaurant Group's service marks, including "O'Charley's", "Ninety Nine", "Village Inn", "Legendary Baking", "Bakers Square", and other service marks and trademarks as important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our brands' menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our Restaurant Group's service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where we have restaurants. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.
We license the use of our registered trademarks and service marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees' and licensees' activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and service marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks and service marks.
Information Security
We and our unconsolidated affiliates are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information.
We and our unconsolidated affiliates remain focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect the clients and information systems of our operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services. As the primary products and services of our operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established risk management policies, including those related to information security and cybersecurity, designed to monitor and mitigate information security related risks.
Human Capital Resources
Employees
As of January 31, 2021, Cannae and our consolidated subsidiaries had 14,509 employees, which includes 14,358 in our Restaurant Group and 151 in the various majority-owned businesses comprising our Corporate and other segment. None of our employees are unionized or represented by any collective agency. We believe that our relations with employees are generally good.
Our Manager and Cannae LLC rely on the experience and expertise of a small number of highly qualified and experienced employees which make up our management team. We continually assess our management team's capabilities and capacity with a view toward the long term sustainability of the Company's operations.
Diversity
We stand committed to our philosophy that all employees deserve an inclusive workplace, one where each employee feels heard and empowered. All employees – regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identification – are given equal access to opportunities throughout the organization. We believe that having a variety of employee ideas, perspectives, and experiences are key components of our success. The diversity of our employees and directors allows us to connect to our investees in important ways and offer them meaningful insights to our business operations. We have a written nondiscrimination policy that is distributed to all employees as part of our employee handbook. Employees must acknowledge our employee handbook and specifically our nondiscrimination policy annually.
Our Board leads by example in its commitment to diversity. In 2019, our Board codified its commitment to consider all aspects of diversity when selecting new director nominees, including candidates with a diversity of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identification by integrating it into the director selection criteria in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. In February 2021, Barry Moullet and David Aung, both of whom identified themselves as having diverse backgrounds, joined our Board.
