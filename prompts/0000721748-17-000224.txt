Industry and Regulatory Overview
 

1
-

As of March 31, 2017, 28 states and the District of Columbia legally allow their citizens to use cannabis for medicinal or recreational use governed by state specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis use is in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. However, on August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a memorandum providing that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing cannabis-related use, and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems, the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics laws. The memorandum further stated that the U.S Justice Department’s limited investigative and prosecutorial resources will be focused on eight priorities to prevent unintended consequences of the state laws, including distribution of cannabis to minors, preventing the distribution of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not, and preventing money laundering, violence and drugged driving.
 
On December 11, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice issued another memorandum with regard to its position and enforcement protocol with regard to Indian Country, stating that the eight priorities in the previous federal memo would guide the United States Attorneys' cannabis enforcement efforts in Indian Country. On December 16, 2014, as a component of the federal spending bill, the Obama administration enacted regulations that prohibit the Department of Justice from using funds to prosecute state-based legal medical cannabis programs.

Competition
 
Our competitors include professional services firms dedicated to the regulated cannabis industry, as well as suppliers of equipment and supplies commonly utilized in the cultivation, processing, or retail sale of cannabis. We compete in markets where cannabis has been legalized and regulated, which includes various states within the United States, it’s territories and Indian Country therein and Canada. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis products. We believe that by being well established in the industry, our experience and success to date, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our operations and results. 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have 6 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, all of whom are U.S based, primarily in Colorado at our Denver headquarters. None of our U.S employees are represented by a labor union.
