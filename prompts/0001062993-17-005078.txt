 Lexarias consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
 In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common shares refer to the shares in our common stock. References to CAD$ refers to Canadian dollars. 
 As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms "we", "us", "our" and "our company" mean Lexaria Bioscience Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, Lexaria CanPharm Corp., a Canadian corporation, our 51% owned (100% as of October 2017) subsidiary PoViva Tea, LLC (PoViva"), an entity incorporated in the state of Nevada, and our 50% ownership of Ambarii Trade Corporation (Ambarii), a Canadian corporation, unless otherwise stated. 
 General and Historical Overview of Our Business 
 The Company was formed on December 9, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada as an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties in the United States and Canada. In March of 2014, the Company began its entry into the bioscience and alternative health and wellness business and discontinued its involvement in the oil and gas business in November 2014. In May 2016, the Company also commenced out-licensing its patented technology for improved delivery of bioactive compounds that promotes healthy ingestion methods, lower overall dosing and higher effectiveness in active molecule delivery. The Company has its office in Kelowna, BC, Canada. 
 Effective at the opening of trading on October 28, 2009, our shares of common stock began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (formerly, Canadian National Stock Exchange) under the trading symbol LXX. 
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol "LXRP" and on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol LXX. 
 In 2014, the Company submitted an application to enter the legal medical marijuana business in Canada and also launched a hemp oil-based food supplement company in the USA.
 The Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Enertopia Corp for a prospective medical marijuana business under the Canadian Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) for a 49% net ownership interest in the business (Enertopia 51%) utilizing an identified location in Burlington, Ontario. On September 15th, 2017, the Company issued 625,000 shares of its common stock from the exercise of warrants previously granted for proceeds of $93,750. All warrants were exercised by third parties who are neither officers nor directors of the Company. 
 4 

On June 26, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Enertopia Corp. and Shaxon Enterprises Ltd. to sell its 49% interest in the Burlington Joint Venture and the MMPR application number 10MMPR0610. Pursuant to the agreement, the joint venture received a non-refundable $10,000 deposit and is entitled to receive up to $1,500,000 in milestone payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. All payments made pursuant to the agreement would be divided 51% to Enertopia Corp. and 49% to Lexaria Bioscience. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company can neither guarantee nor provide a meaningful time estimate regarding the grant of a production license for the Burlington facility. 
 The Companys food sciences activities include the development of our proprietary nutrient infusion technologies for the production of superfoods, and the production of enhanced food products under our two consumer product brands, ViPova and Lexaria Energy. The Companys patented lipid nutrient infusion technology DehydraTECHTM is believed to improve taste, rapidity and delivery of bioactive compounds that include cannabinoids, vitamins NSAIDs Nicotine and other molecules compared to what is possible without lipophilic enhancement technology. This can allow for lower overall dosing requirements and/or higher effectiveness in active molecule delivery. Lexaria has caused to be filed several patent pending applications with the US Patent Office, and also internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). On October 26, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 9,474,725 (granted June 15 2017 in Australia No. 2015274698), Cannabinoid Infused Food and Beverage Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof, pertaining to Lexarias method of improving bioavailability and taste of certain cannabinoid lipophilic active agents in food products. Lexaria hopes to reduce other common but less healthy ingestion methods, such as smoking, as it embraces the benefits of its technology for public health.
 As at August 31, 2017, we only had one reportable segment, being the development and usage, including licensing of our proprietary nutrient infusion technology. 
 We maintain our registered agent's office and our U.S. business office at Nevada Agency and Transfer Company, 50 West Liberty, Suite 880, Reno, Nevada 89501. Our telephone number is (755) 322-0626. 
 The address of our principal executive office is 156 Valleyview Rd, Kelowna BC Canada V1X3M4. We have administrative functions located in Vancouver, British Columbia and Phoenix, Arizona.
 Our Current Business
 Our companys business plan is currently focused on the development of strategic partnerships with licensees for our patented technology in exchange for up front and/or staged licensing fees over time. Secondarily and more generally, we continue to investigate national and international opportunities for development and distribution of the Companys enhanced functional food and supplement product offerings; to investigate expansions and additions to our intellectual property portfolio; and, to search for additional opportunities in alternative health sectors. This includes the acquisition or development of intellectual property if and when we believe it advisable to do so. We announced issuance of our first patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on October 26, 2016 and have received a Notice of Acceptance from the Australian Patent Office with related patent issuance date June 15 2017 No. 2015274698. We announced on November 2, 2017 a new Notice of Allowance from the USPTO that included the delivery of additional molecules such as psychoactive cannabinoids, vitamins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and nicotine all utilizing our DehydraTECHTM delivery technology. We are seeking additional patent protection for what we believe to be a unique process for the nutritional delivery of certain molecules such as cannabinoids, Nicotine, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and Vitamins. To achieve sustainable and profitable growth, our company intends to control the timing and costs of our projects wherever possible.

 On January 19, 2017, the Company and NeutriSci International Inc. (NeutriSci) announced the successful development and initial trial of the industrys first zero-sugar cannabinoid / pterostilbene edible tablet utilizing both NeutriScis and Lexarias proprietary and patented technologies. NeutriSci and Lexaria confirmed that the companies expect to officially bind the JV agreement to market and commercialize a line of edible products. Product development is continuing.
 On February 8, 2017, the Company through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary Lexaria CanPharm Corp., signed and entered a master collaborative research agreement with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) to investigate technical aspects and new opportunities associated with bioavailability enhancement of lipophilic active ingredient compositions. Under the agreement, the Company and the NRC will both provide up to CAD$125,000 in funding for this research, a total investment of up to CAD$250,000. The master research agreement has an 18-month term, during which a number of shorter-term studies will be undertaken. The collaboration will investigate and define the chemical nature of the molecular association that Lexaria`s patented technology is believed to effectuate between lipophilic active agents and fatty acids as solubility and bioavailability enhancing agents. The first phase of research under this agreement was underway as of August 31, 2017. 
 On February 8, 2017, the Company issued 29,091 shares of its common stock in settlement of $16,000 service fee, previously recognized within accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 On February 27, 2017, the Company received a Notice of Acceptance from the Australian Patent Office that Lexarias Australian patent application 2015274698 was accepted with a patent issuance date expected in June, 2017. The Notice of Acceptance covers Lexaria patent application entitled Food and beverage compositions infused with lipophilic active agents and methods of use thereof, which has been accepted with the same set of claims previously issued in US Patent No 9,474,725 specific to non-psychoactive cannabinoids. Subsequently the Company received a Certificate of Grant for a Standard Patent No. 2015274698 dated June 15 2017 with a twenty year term. 
 On March 14, 2017, the Company commenced the formal design phase for studies to be conducted under the master collaborative research agreement with the NRC.

Subsequent to August 31, 2017, the company plans to hold an annual and special meeting of stockholders at the office of our law firm, Macdonald Tuskey located in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to include as part of the proceedings the approval of the plan of conversion whereby our corporate jurisdiction will be changed from the State of Nevada to the Province of British Columbia, Canada by means of a process called a conversion and a continuation. Important details for stockholders related to the conversion and the associated risks for the company and stockholders are included in the S-4 Registration Statement to be released, as of the writing of this document. There are risks associated with not proceeding with the conversion regarding the increasing complexity of compliance with the regulatory framework and the associated increasing costs, the restrictions on the promotion and sale of our stocks to US investors that limit the potential liquidity of our stock, and an increasingly complex environment that can negatively impact Lexaria even as an ancillary involved company via technology licensing to entities in the state legal cannabidiol and cannabis markets. As at the time of the writing of this document the date of the meeting had not been specified.
 Food Science and Technology 
 Lexaria is a Biotechnology and food science company focused on developing and out-licensing its proprietary technology for improved taste, rapidity, and delivery of bioactive compounds in foods and other ingestible products Lexaria is focusing its capital and management time on its pursuit of intellectual property, technology licensing opportunities, an expanding portfolio of patent pending applications, and functional food and supplement formulations.
 On November 11, 2014, the Company acquired 51% of PoViva Tea LLC and executed an operating agreement to develop a business of legally producing, manufacturing, importing/exporting, testing, researching and developing, a line of hemp oil with cannabidiol-infused teas, drinks and foods. Lexaria oversees all aspects of the business including, but not limited to, production, product quality, licensing, testing, product legality, accounting, marketing, capital investment, capital raising, sales, branding, advertising and fulfillment. Pursuant to the agreement, there is a Management Committee, whereby there are two representatives from Lexaria and one of the founding members of PoViva. On October 31, 2017, Lexaria purchased all remaining ownership interest to own 100% of Poviva Tea LLC.
 The Company introduced an expanding variety of hemp fortified consumer food products throughout 2015 to demonstrate Lexarias DehydraTECHTM technology to both consumers and potential licensees. From January 2015 to December 2015, seven (7) flavors of teas; hot chocolate; coffee, and two (2) flavors of protein energy bars were introduced  all utilizing Lexarias patented technology DehydraTECHTM for the more efficient delivery of bioactive molecules infused within those food products. 
 In the production of the products, for each raw material to be used in ViPova -branded products, the Company assesses if the product inputs and the completed products comply with all applicable food and drug laws, and that the inputs and the finished products meet all applicable legal and quality standards including and as it relates to hemp oil content; THC content; molds and mildews; heavy metals; and may measure additional components.
 The US Federal government, through the US Department of Health and Human Services, owns US Patent #6630507, which among other things, claims that 
  Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia. 

For reference, cannabinoids are compounds that affect cannabinoid receptors located on many human cells. CB1 receptors are widely found within the human brain; and CB2 receptors are found with the human immune system and have been linked to anti-inflammatory and other responses. 
 Despite independent scientific findings in many locations around the world, some regulatory agencies do not officially recognize that a human endocannabinoid system exists.

Over one hundred different cannabinoids have been isolated from the cannabis plant, most of which do not have psychoactive properties. One that does have psychoactive properties is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Endocannabinoids are produced naturally in the human body while phytocannabinoids are produced in several plant species, most abundantly in the Cannabis plant. 
 Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the major phytocannabinoid forms of cannabinoids and is not psychoactive, often contributing more than 35% of the extracts from the cannabis plant resin. Cannabidiol occurs naturally in other plant species beyond cannabis. For example, the most widely acknowledged alternative source of phytocannabinoid is in the better understood Echinacea species, in widespread use as a dietary supplement. Most phytocannabinoids are virtually insoluble in water but are soluble in lipids and alcohol. The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) has exempted CBD from its 2018 list of banned substances. 
 The Alternative Health sector is large and growing. A long term Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was conducted from 2002 until 2008 with at least 29,370 subjects asked repeatedly if they had seen any kind of health care practitioner in the previous six months. The survey recorded whether the health care provider was a complementary and alternative medicine care professional, including homeopathic, naturopathic, or herbalist.
 Between 5.3% and 5.8% of the survey group at any one time reported that they had seen a complementary or alternative medicine provider. Based on the US population of ~323,000,000, this suggests between 17.1 million and 18.7 million Americans are seeking an alternative health care professional at any given time. 
 Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an April 2011 NCHS Data Brief, reported that more than 50% of the population uses dietary supplements of one kind or another. Detailed findings from that report included: 
 

Use of dietary supplements is common among the U.S. adult population. Over
 40% used supplements in 1988 1994, and over one-half in 20032006. 

Multivitamins/multiminerals are the most commonly used dietary supplements,
 with approximately 40% of men and women reporting use during 20032006. 

Use of supplemental calcium increased from 28% during 19881994 to 61%
 during 20032006 among women aged 60 and over. 
 Status of operation; Consumer product development and sales 
 More than 150 million Americans drink tea every day, amounting to some 79 billion servings of tea in America every year. Our launch of ViPova Tea brand is meant to tap into this existing demand. Part of our corporate strategy is to build national brands through products that large groups of potential customers are already familiar and comfortable with.
 PoViva Tea LLC has filed patents pending to bind active hemp oil ingredients with a lipid, potentially allowing for more efficient and comforting delivery of the CBD. 
 Lexaria began producing cash flows from its products in January 2015; focused on the immediate opportunities in the hemp-oil-sectors that are federally legal. Cannabinoids have been found by many researchers to have antioxidant properties and Lexaria plans to use the DehydraTECHTM patented process to infuse hemp oils into a number of popular food and beverages.
 Lexaria has launched a line of premium products, always relying on our DehydraTECHTM patented infusion process, to bring hemp oil into the mainstream. Because hemp oil does not have psychoactive properties we expect our products to appeal to the widest possible customer base. To date we have focused our sales efforts across the continental USA. Some studies have found that 3% of the Canadian population regularly consumes hemp food products, while 1% of the American population regularly consumes hemp food products. We believe the consumption of hemp based food products offers exceptional growth possibilities. 
 According to Nutrition Business Journal, the Organic Food sector was a $246 billion industry in the USA during 2014, while Dietary Supplements was a $34.6 billion industry. According to Arcview, state-legal Cannabis was a $4.7 billion US industry in 2015 and expected to grow to over a $20 billion sector before 2025 but is clearly a much smaller industry sector than the more established food sectors. Lexaria has not yet determined whether our hemp oil-infused products will be accepted into any or all three of these particular sectors.

Lexaria has a main corporate website as well as smaller e-commerce focused websites devoted to consumer products. The majority of product sales have taken place through the e-commerce websites. A contracted national distribution center ensures rapid and accurate fulfillment of all orders. A 1-800 ordering center has also been placed into operation.
 Lexaria had previously launched the Lexaria Energy brand that is 100% owned by the Company. Under this brand, the Company plans to develop hemp oil-infused food products for people with active lifestyles, such as protein bars, protein shakes and other similar products. On November 3, 2015, Lexaria Energy10 protein bars became available for retail sales with two flavors. The original contract manufacturer of these protein bars was unable to fulfill additional orders and we have not currently been able to locate and contract an alternative location to manufacture this more complicated food product, with the result that the product is temporarily discontinued while we search for a suitable manufacturing location. 
 Through the November 2014 acquisition of 51% of Poviva Teas LLC, and October 2017 100% acquisition, Lexaria acquired control of certain patents pending, allowances and grants with the United States Patent Office. Lexaria has worked to broaden the patents and extend their utility to molecules other than those originally named. 
 On June 11, 2015, Lexaria initiated the simultaneous filing of a U.S. utility patent application and an International patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) procedure, both at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These applications follow the Companys 2014 and 2015 family of provisional patent application filings in the U.S. and serve two additional broad purposes: 
 
1. | Lexaria is seeking protection of its intellectual property under international treaties. To this end Lexaria has filed for PCT patent application protection. There are 148 countries that are signatories to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, including such major markets as Canada, China, India, much of Europe and the Middle East, the United Kingdom and Japan among others. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Lexaria believes its lipid infusion technology has applications beyond the delivery of just cannabinoids. Based on further formulation testing, Lexaria has included additional lipophilic molecules that may be delivered via food and beverage formats utilizing its technology, widely encompassing three major new market opportunities for the Company: Nicotine; Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatories (NSAIDs); and Vitamins. 

 In December 2015, the Company filed two further provisional patent applications in the U.S. These new applications served to further broaden the variety and applicability of base compounds that can be used when formulating the Companys lipid based technology. The first of these applications identify compounds like edible starches (e.g., tapioca starch) that are commonly used in food products today and could, therefore, serve as a base for formulating and incorporating the Companys Technology into a wide variety of every day food products. The second of these applications identify emulsifier compounds like gum Arabic that are commonly used in beverage products today in order to facilitate similar flexibility for formulating the Companys Technology in every day, shelf-stable beverages. 
 On October 26, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S Patent No. 9474725, Cannabinoid Infused Food and Beverage Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof, pertaining to our method of improving bioavailability and taste of certain cannabinoid lipophilic active agents in food products. This is the Companys first patent granted and has a publish date of October 27, 2016 (June 10 2017 in Australia No. 2015274698) and protects our technology for twenty years.
 The Company does not know and cannot know whether these strategies will be successful, or if successful, how long it will take to gain consumer acceptance and customer loyalty. It can be a challenge to be successful by introducing new consumer products to a competitive retail marketplace, and we can offer no assurances that our products will be a commercial success.

International patent protection 
 When Lexaria first began examining the legal medical cannabis market in 2013, the Company believed it could make an impact in perhaps both the Canadian and U.S. marketplaces. Our pursuit and development of technology has expanded our potential area of impact, both geographically and by sector. Because of the applicability of our technology to markets outside of the legal cannabis sector, we have taken the necessary steps to protect that intellectual property within larger global markets, regardless of whether they lie within the medical cannabis sector or in other unrelated sectors. 
 Additional molecules 
 NICOTINE. More than 99% of all nicotine that is consumed worldwide is delivered through smoking cigarettes. Approximately 6,000,000 deaths per year, worldwide, are attributed primarily to the delivery of nicotine through the act of smoking according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also estimates that over $170 billion per year is spent just in the USA on direct medical care costs for adult smokers. 69% of U.S. adult smokers want to quit smoking and 43% of US adult smokers have attempted to quit in any twelve-month period. 
 Worldwide, retail cigarette sales were worth $722 billion in 2013, with over 5.7 trillion cigarettes sold to more than 1 billion smokers.
 RELEVANCE: Lexaria postulates that delivery of nicotine to satisfy current demand, utilizing our patent pending lipid-delivery technology in common food groups, could shift demand from smoking cigarettes to alternative nicotine-based food products. Since most of the adverse health outcomes of nicotine consumption are associated with the delivery method and only to a lesser degree to the actual ingestion of nicotine, there could be a vast positive community health outcome through the reduction in smoking cigarettes. Additional research and regulatory compliant investigations would need to be conducted before otherwise healthy foods such as tea, coffee or energy bar snacks containing nicotine could be introduced. Nicotine is a named molecule in the latest Lexaria patent applications.
 NSAID. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatories are the second-largest category of pain management treatment options in the world. The global pain management market was estimated at $22 billion in 2011, with $5.4 billion of this market being served by NSAIDs. The U.S. makes up over one-half of the global market. The opioids market (such as morphine) form the largest single pain management sector but are known to be associated with serious dependence and tolerance issues. 
 Some of the most commonly known NSAIDs are ASA (Aspirin), Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and Acetaminophen (Tylenol). (Acetaminophen is not accepted by all persons to be an NSAID.) Although NSAIDs are generally a safe and effective treatment method for pain, they have been associated with a number of gastrointestinal problems including dyspepsia and gastric bleeding. 
 RELEVANCE: Lexaria postulates that delivery of NSAIDs through a lipid-based mechanism could provide the beneficial properties of pain relief with lessened negative gastrointestinal effects, and also potentially deliver lower dosages of active ingredients with similar pain management outcomes as current pill forms at higher dosages. ASA, Piroxicam, Diclofenac, Indomethacin, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen are all named molecules in the latest Lexaria patent applications. 
 VITAMINS. The global vitamin and supplement market is worth $68 billion according to Euromonitor. The category is both broad and deep, comprised of many popular and some lesser known substances. Vitamins in general are thought to be an $8.5 billion annual market in the U.S. The U.S. is the largest single national market in the world, and China and Japan are the 2nd and 3rd largest vitamin markets. 
 Vitamin E is fat soluble and can be incorporated into cell membranes which can protect them from oxidative damage. Global consumption of natural source vitamin E was 10,900 metric tons in 2013 worth $611.9 million.
 12 

RELEVANCE: Lexaria postulates that delivery of fat soluble vitamins through its patent-pending lipid-based delivery mechanism may result in less waste and lower dosages required than most current pill forms. As well, ingestion of pills is an unpleasant experience for many people so it is possible that vitamin delivery through common food groups could vastly expand market demand for this sector. Vitamin E is a named molecule in the latest Lexaria patent applications. 
 On August 11, 2015, Lexaria signed a license agreement with PoViva Tea LLC for $10,000, granting Lexaria a 35-year non exclusive worldwide license to unencumbered use of PoViva Tea LLCs IP Rights, including rights of resale. This license agreement ensures Lexaria has full access to the underlying patent pending infusion technology. 
 Scientific testing and validation
 On August 24, 2015, the Company announced potential industry-changing achievements in enhanced gastro-intestinal absorption of cannabidiol (CBD) utilizing Lexarias patented technology. The third-party testing was conducted in two phases of in vitro tests beginning in June and completed in August, 2015. 
 The independent laboratory results delivered average CBD permeability of 499% of baseline permeability, compared to CBD permeability without Lexarias technology. These results exceed Company expectations. This was assessed in a strictly controlled, in vitro experiment using a human intestinal tissue model. Samples of Lexarias commercially available CBD-fortified ViPova black tea were administered in the model compared with concentration-matched CBD control preparations that lacked Lexarias patented formulation and process enhancements. Lexaria believes that its in vitro findings provide compelling evidence of the intestinal absorption enhancing capabilities of its technology, based on which it is exploring opportunities to progress to more advanced, follow-on bioavailability testing in animals.
 The tests also showed 325% of baseline gastro-intestinal permeability of CBD comparing Lexarias CBD-fortified ViPova black tea to a second control of CBD and black tea combined, without Lexarias patented formulation enhancements. This confirmed that the specialized processing undertaken by Lexaria during its manufacturing process together with its formulation enhancements, does indeed significantly improve absorption levels. 
 The bioavailability of CBD (or of THC) varies greatly by delivery method. Smoking typically delivers cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of 30% (Huestis (2007) Chem. Biodivers. 4:17701804; McGilveray (2005) Pain Res. Manag. 10 Suppl. A:15A  22A). By comparison, orally consumed cannabis edibles typically deliver cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of only 5% (Karschner et al. (2011) Clin. Chem. 57:6675).
 The Companys present findings suggest that its DehydraTECHTM technology may achieve a 5-fold improvement in cannabinoid absorption in edible form over that which can be achieved without its proprietary process and formulation enhancements. This conceptually supports that Lexarias technology represents a significant breakthrough in cannabinoid delivery by approximating the high absorption levels achieved as though through administration by smoking, but without the associated negative effects on human health caused by smoking. 
 The tests were completed in two phases culminating with testing using simulated intestinal fluid conditions that delivered these findings. These results were stronger than earlier iterations of the tests that did not use a simulated intestinal fluid environment and contributed to Lexarias understanding of the mechanisms at work. For these and other reasons, Lexaria believes that bioavailability testing in animals is likely to yield even stronger absorption results in the presence of natural intestinal fluid conditions. 
 CBD has been repeatedly found to provide beneficial pain relieving, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, neuroprotection, anti-psychotic, and anti-convulsive effects among others. Lexarias DehydraTECHTM technology could significantly reduce individual serving requirements for CBD to consumers. This could lead to reduced costs of consumption for consumers and increased profitability for Lexaria. 
 Lexaria believes that the same technology used to enhance the absorption of CBD in laboratory tests, is applicable to THC, nicotine, NSAIDs and other lipophilic compounds that are widely used today. 
 During January 2015, Lexaria conducted a study of nitric oxide levels in humans, as a biomarker for absorption of cannabidiol, with the expectation that it would provide additional evidence of the efficient absorption of cannabidiol from Lexaria food products enhanced with hemp oil, by demonstrating the elevation of nitric oxide in the human body in response to product ingestion. 
 13 

The study data from human subjects demonstrated significant elevation of systemic nitric oxide levels as a surrogate biomarker for cannabidiol (CBD) bioabsorption in response to ingestion of Lexaria's products. This provided clinical support for the CBD bioavailability enhancing properties of Lexaria's patented DehydraTECHTM technology, on the premise that bioavailable CBD is known to elevate levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the human body which, in turn, stimulates release of nitric oxide in the vascular system.
 In summary, consuming Lexaria and ViPova food products resulted in elevated levels of nitric oxide within the body. The results of the study indicated that all Lexaria and ViPova food products elicited significant increases in salivary nitric oxide, achieving levels from 110 µM to as high as 220 µM in the test subjects. The beverage products generally had faster initial responses in as little as 15 minutes after product ingestion, whereas the initial responses from the protein-energy bars required 30 minutes. The faster response time with the beverage products was to be expected, given the relative ease of digesting liquids versus solids. All products sustained their maximum levels of nitric oxide detection through to the 60-minute end-points used in the study, indicating a need for additional study to determine the length of time that nitric oxide levels remain elevated following production consumption. 
 The study assessed six flavors of ViPova tea (Yunan Black, Herbal Cherry Black, Earl Grey, Herbal Bengal Chai, Herbal Masala Chai and Decaf English Breakfast), ViPova Columbian Supremo Coffee, ViPova Hot Chocolate and Lexaria Energy Foods Chocolate Berry Date and Cashew Berry Date protein-energy bars. 
 Six healthy human subjects (3 male and 3 female) between the ages of 22 and 65 years of age were recruited for the study. Subjects were screened for cardiovascular and allergic response to hemp products, were non-smokers and did not have any history of substance or alcohol abuse. One product was studied per day across all six subjects, with each subject consuming a full product serving size. Subjects were required to refrain from eating food or using vape products for at least 12 hours before test article administration on each day of the study. Nitric oxide levels in the test subjects were assessed using a commercially available, colorimetric test kit designed to quantify systemic nitric oxide via a detectable salivary marker. Immediately before test article administration each day, all subjects were required to demonstrate a negative baseline nitric oxide saliva test. Subjects were considered to have a negative test strip reading at a level of 20 µM according to the test strip scale, and positive readings anywhere above this. Subjects performed salivary nitric oxide testing at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post-consumption of each product. All subjects remained sedentary from baseline through to the completion of testing for each product. 
 Product distribution agreements 
 On January 28, 2016, Lexaria signed a distribution agreement with Telluride Coffee Roasters, LLC. This agreement has since ended and will not be renewed due to inactivity. 
 Technology out-licensing 
 On May 14, 2016, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement allowing the Licensee, for a two-year period, to utilize the Companys technology to create, test, manufacture, and sell marijuana-infused consumable and/or topical products, in the state of Colorado, with an option of extending the terms of the Licensing Agreement to Washington, Oregon, and California. In addition to the granting of the license, the Company will provide support services to the Licensee in connection with the use of the Companys technology during the term of the Licensing Agreement. The Licensing Agreement is the first contracted, predictable, and significant revenue stream to be achieved as a direct result of Lexarias technological advantage in the marketplace. Under the terms of the Licensing Agreement, the Licensee will pay a minimum of $122,000 in pre-defined staged payments to Lexaria over the initial two-year term. As per the Licensing Agreement, if the Licensee were to introduce certain product lines utilizing Lexarias technology in each of the four states contemplated, Lexaria could expect to receive a maximum of $1,064,000 over approximately 3.5 years, and the Licensee would enjoy semi-exclusivity to introduce its products in each of those states. As of August 31 2017 the company had received all of the pre-defined payments to August 31 2017 for a total receipt of $70,000 corresponding to the areas under the license agreement where the licensee has been active to-date. 
 14 

The continuation of our business interests in these sectors is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful programs of development, and, ultimately, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 
 We are not yet profitable and have not yet demonstrated our ability to generate significant revenues from our business plan. We will require additional corporate funds if our existing capital is not sufficient to support the Company until potential future profitability is reached. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our long-term operations. We do not expect to require additional operating capital during our fiscal 2018 year. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other longer-term obligations as they become due. In such event, we could be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional long-term financing if we do in fact require it. 
 Our business plan does not anticipate that we will hire a large number of employees or that we will require extensive office space. We expect to be able to utilize contracted third parties for most of our production and distribution needs, instead focusing on our capital on higher value added aspects of the business such as research and development, and scientific testing. We have no current plans to build our own production facility. 
 Our company relies on the business experience of our existing management, on the technical abilities of consulting experts, and on the technical and operational abilities of its operating partner companies to evaluate business opportunities. 
 Competition 
 The legal marijuana industry is comprised of several sub-sectors, and is legal under different guidelines in many states though it remains illegal under most federal laws. Notwithstanding, the overall sector is generally recognized to be one of the fastest growing in the USA, with state-legal revenue of over $8 billion in 2016. Independent projections and publicized reports expect revenue of $20 billion or more in 2020, both as the sector gains in credibility and acceptance, and as more and more states legalize either medical use or adult recreational use; or both. In any fast growing industry, competition is expected to be both strong and also difficult to evaluate as to the most effective competitive threats. While we are an early adopter within the cannabinoid delivery sector, there are already reports of more than 300 public companies that have claimed to be involved in the sector in some fashion; and an unknown number of private companies. Our current strategies may prove to be ineffective as the sector grows and matures, and if so, we will have to adapt quickly to changing sectoral circumstances. Accordingly, the Company intends to aggressively pursue technology out-licensing opportunities not only within the cannabinoids sector where it is already active, but also across other sectors where its DehydraTECHTM technology is patent allowed and/or pending, including the opportunities in the vitamin and supplements sector, the pain relief sector and the nicotine products sector.
 Competition in alternative health sectors and in consumer products in the USA is fierce. We expect to encounter competitive threats from existing participants in the sector and new entrants. Although PoViva Tea LLC has filed numerous patent pending applications to protect intellectual property, there is no assurance that patent applications beyond those already allowed and issued will be granted nor that other firms may not file superior patents pending. Food supplements, organic foods, and health food markets are all well established and our Company will face many challenges trying to enter these markets. 
 Compliance with Government Regulation
 At least 24 States in the USA have passed some form of legislation related to that states permission to grow, cultivate, sell or use marijuana either for medical purposes or for recreational or adult use purposes; or both. The various state legislation is not necessarily harmonious with one another, leading to potential conflicts between state laws. It is most often not legal to transport cannabis-related products across state lines. 
 Lexaria does not touch the plant in any location within or outside of the USA. The Company complies with federal law that provides for certain exemptions for agricultural (industrial) hemp and certain byproducts to be manufactured and sold in the US. The DehydraTECHTM technology may have applications within the legal marijuana sector and Lexaria may seek to license that technology to companies that have met and comply with state regulations for the sale or distribution of cannabis related products in any particular jurisdiction.
 15 

Lexarias position is that, just as a telephone company provides communications services, and an electric company provides electrical power, our provision of technological services to a state-legal cannabis company is in compliance with laws and required regulations. 
 Lexarias patented DehydraTECHTM technology may also have application in completely separate sectors such as vitamins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and nicotine. We have no products nor operations in any of these sectors today. If we enter any of these sectors at any time, we will be exposed to and of necessity will have to comply with, all local, state and federal regulations in each of those sectors. As a result of the possibility of Lexaria being involved in a number of disparate business sectors, compliance with government regulations could require significant resources and expertise from our company.
 Our Former Planned Medical Marijuana Production Operations 
 On June 7, 2013 the Government of Canada implemented then-new legislation, the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR), concerning the production and sale of medical marijuana. The MMPR permitted the licensing of commercial growers beginning April 1, 2014, while eliminating existing regulations permitting the production of medical marijuana on a personal-use basis. The revised regulations created conditions for a commercial industry in Canada that is responsible for medical marijuana production and distribution, by eliminating small-scale, personal-use production. Commercial growers are now able to submit applications to Health Canada for the production of medical marijuana and, if licensed, supply patients who qualify for the product at a price that would be established by market forces and at the discretion of producers. As of June 2017, 50 producers have become licensed under the latest versions of Canadian regulations. 
 On June 26, 2015, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Shaxon Enterprises Ltd. and Enertopia Corp. to sell our 49% interest in our Burlington, Ontario medical marijuana project application, including the MMPR application (no. 10MMPR0610) for our proposed production facility. The Burlington MMPR license application has continued in the application process under new ownership. Pursuant to the agreement, the joint venture received a non-refundable $10,000 deposit and is entitled to receive up to $1,500,000 in milestone payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. These monies would be split 51% to Enertopia and 49% to our Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we can neither guarantee nor provide a meaningful time estimate regarding the grant of a production license for the Burlington facility and at this time believe it may be unlikely to be awarded. 
 Since June 12, 2015 the Company has had no direct involvement or ownership interest in any active or prospective operations or permit applications under the MMPR. The Company has no plans at this time to apply for a license in any jurisdiction for the production or sale of legal medical marijuana. 
 Market for Medical Marijuana in Canada 
 It is estimated by Health Canada that the overall market for medical marijuana in Canada under the new MMPR will be approximately $1.3 billion per year by 2024 (source: Health Canada/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). Health Canada projects that the number of licensed users will increase to over 450,000 by 2024. Health Canada formerly sold medical marijuana, produced on contract by Prairie Plant Systems (formerly the only licensed producer in Canada), for $5 a gram. It is estimated that the price per gram under the new licensing system will average $7.60 per gram as producers set prices without interference from government (source Health Canada/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).
 Despite these estimates the medical marijuana market is relatively new and largely unproven. The adoption rate of commercial medical marijuana by qualified patients is difficult to determine but a portion (approximately 13%) of the qualified patient population is already conditioned to purchasing government contracted producers under the old system (source: Health Canada). Furthermore, it is anticipated that the convenience of a wide selection of medical marijuana strains delivered directly to patients in a discrete and concealed package will be attractive. Healthcare practitioners are key stakeholders as they will be signing and providing the medical documentation needed for patients to register with commercial producers. Regulations under the MMPR are not significantly different for healthcare practitioners already familiar with the process under the former MMAR. Licensed producers are held responsible for quality of the product provided as the MMPR outlines strict rules for quality assessment and control, cleanliness, manufacturing, and pesticide use. Security and diversion to the black market remain a concern but MMPR outlines strict rules for segregation of duties and security clearances, background checks for employees and officers, tracking of product in and out of the premises, and camera surveillance.

The Use of Marijuana for Medical Purposes (source Cantech Letter: Canadas Medical Marijuana Industry: A Top Down Look) 
 The marijuana or cannabis plant, aka cannabis sativa, contains more than 80 cannabinoids, a group of chemical compounds which includes delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Research has shown that THC and CBD influence different regions of the central nervous system and have different effects on cannabis users [Borgwardt, Biol Psychiatry, 2008]. Most of the psychoactive effects associated with the use of cannabis are caused by THC, whereas CBD has been shown to have anti-anxiety, anti-nausea, anti-inflammatory, and anti-psychotic effects [Bergamaschi, Curr Drug Saf., 2011; Niesink, Front Psychiatry, 2013]. Cannabis smoking often leads to adverse effects such as increases and fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure, euphoria, anxiety, and impairment of cognition and memory. Cannabis also contains a similar array of detrimental and carcinogenic compounds compared to cigarette smoke, some of which are present even at higher concentrations [Leung, J Am Board Fam Med, 2011]. 
 Medical marijuana is used and has been tested in a variety of indications. In the last ten years, there have been estimated 300 individually registered trials used cannabis, THC, or CBD as the intervention. Excluding addiction, the indication that accounted for the majority (42%) of trials, medical marijuana has been tested in a wide range of indications to help patients cope with pain not only from disease itself, but also for relief from strong and sometimes toxic medication, such as chemotherapy. Neurological disorders, mental health, muscle and back problems, and inflammation (such as gastrointestinal disorders) are common indications under study. 
 Current Status of our Previous Medical Marijuana Business 
 Following the announcement of the MMPR in June, 2013, our management began identifying and evaluating opportunities for entry into the medical marijuana industry in Canada. We do not currently have any direct involvement in marijuana related activities in the United States or Canada.
Enertopia Joint Venture 
 On May 28, 2014, our company and Enertopia Corp. entered into a definitive agreement to develop a joint business for the production, manufacture, propagation, import/export, testing, research and development of marijuana in the Province of Ontario under the MMPR.
 On June 26, 2015, we signed a Definitive agreement to sell our interest in the Burlington joint venture along with the MMPR application number 10MMPR0610. The Burlington MMPR license application will continue in the application process under new ownership. Pursuant to the agreement, the joint venture received a non-refundable $10,000 deposit and is entitled to receive up to $1,500,000 in milestone payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. These monies would be split 51% to Enertopia and 49% to Lexaria. The Enertopia and Lexaria Master Joint Venture Agreement entered into on March 5, 2014 still governs the relationship between the Company and Enertopia. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we can neither guarantee nor provide a meaningful time estimate regarding the grant of a production license for the Burlington facility. There is no assurance that any monies will in fact ever be received from our sale of the license application.
 Marijuana Production in the United States 
 In the United States it is still illegal under federal law to grow, cultivate and sell medical or adult use marijuana. However more than twenty-five states have approved medical marijuana for use and at least eight states have approved adult use regulations. The United States Federal government justice department has released memos that will respect the individual states where strict guidelines are followed and enforced so that the health, safety and security are protected at all times by state authorities but there is no assurance that federal laws will not at any time be more vigorously enforced. If the individual state framework fails to protect the public the Federal government will act in enforcing the controlled substances act of 1970 and the DEA will enforce the federal law. 
 17 

As at the date of this document, our company has not entered into any prospective or definitive arrangements to produce or distribute marijuana products in the United States and has no intention of engaging in such marijuana related activities in the United States. However, our company continually reviews opportunities and monitors legal and regulatory developments related the medical marijuana sector in both Canada and the United States. We anticipate that we may re-evaluate our participation in the United States medical marijuana sector in the event that medical marijuana production becomes federally sanctioned and, in the meantime, we plan to limit our foray into the marijuana industry to ancillary involvement based on out-licensing of our DehydraTECHTM technology to state licensed producers.
 On November 8 2016 referendums held in various US states increased those areas in the USA where either medical or recreational use marijuana was state-legal. More than 50% of the US population now lives in a state where either medical or recreational marijuana use is permitted by state law, although it is still banned by US federal laws. 
 Contractors 
 The Company primarily uses sub-contractors and consultants in the intellectual property development and licensing, and alternative health product sectors. It primarily engages with consultants to serve our executive needs.
 On November 27, 2008, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with CAB Financial Services Ltd. (CAB") wholly owned by Christopher Bunka for $8,000 per month plus applicable taxes. Effective December 1, 2014, the Company updated the consulting agreement for consulting services of $10,000 a month plus applicable taxes.
 On December 1 2016 the Company entered into a new consulting agreement for consulting services of $12,000 a month plus applicable taxes with CAB, superseding the prior agreement. The term of the agreement is two years but can be terminated by either party by providing two months notice. The Company may pay Mr. Bunka a bonus from time to time, at its sole discretion. Mr. Bunka will be entitled to receive common stock-based and stock option based bonuses upon achieving certain milestones during the time of his consultancy with the Company. These milestones are during the first 12 months after the date of the agreement with CAB,:

Revenue Incentives A as defined above. 
 We do not expect any material changes in the number of contractors over the next 12 month period although individual personnel changes and fluctuations should always be expected. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed. However, with product advancement or retail acceptance of our new products, we may need to retain additional contractors particularly in the fields of product manufacturing, development, sales and distribution.

 Research and Development 
 Lexaria incurred $54,185 (2016 $9,024) in research and development expenditures over the last fiscal year. With the successful financing efforts during fiscal 2017, the Company announced a $1 million budget to conduct research and development and additional scientific testing. Specific R&D programs are in development at this time and will be tightly related to our financial ability to undertake such steps. Due to the notice of allowance in October 2017 significantly expanding the Companys portfolio coverage, Lexaria is examining accelerated timetable options for testing, research and development.

The Companys plans include in vitro absorption tests of our patented technology of molecules such as: Vitamin E, Ibuprofen, and Nicotine. We also plan to conduct our first ever in vivo absorption tests on CBD and on nicotine, all during the upcoming fiscal year.
 Depending on how many of these tests are undertaken, it could require budgets of as much as $1,000,000, or as little as $65,000, to do so. It is in our best interests to remain flexible at this early stage of our R&D efforts in order to capitalize on potential novel findings from early-stage tests and thus re-direct research into specific avenues that offer the most reward.
