 On October 1, 2018, we completed the previously announced sale of all the assets, including intellectual property, used primarily in our Riverside clinical and standardized testing business (“Riverside Business”). 
 Market Overview 
 We operate predominantly within the U.S. K-12 Education market, which represents over $650 billion of total spending annually. Specifically, we focus on the U.S. market for K-12 instructional materials and services, which we estimate to be approximately $11.0 billion in size.
 The U.S. Education market comprises approximately 13,000 K-12 public school districts, 130,000 public and private schools, nearly four million teachers and 50 million total student enrollment across public, private and charter schools. From Fall 2019 to Fall 2028, total elementary and secondary school enrollment, an important driver of long-term growth in the K-12 Education market, is projected to increase by 1.4% to 57.4 million students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

The primary sources of funding for public schools in the U.S. are state and local tax collections, with Federal funding accounting for approximately 9% of public education spending nationally. Consequently, general or localized economic conditions as well as legislative and political decisions which affect the ability of state and school districts to raise revenue through tax collections can have a significant impact on spending and growth in the K-12 Education market. Public K-12 education has been, and remains, a high priority for political leaders, accounting for more than one-fifth of all state and local government spending.
 
Education policy and curriculum choices have traditionally been local prerogatives in the U.S., but Federal law and policy also play an important role. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, reauthorized in 2015 by the Every Student Succeeds Act (“ESSA”), requires that states, as a condition to receiving Federal education funds, adopt challenging academic content standards, administer annual student tests aligned to those standards, develop systems of accountability tied to specific goals for student achievement, and take measures to identify and support low performing schools. ESSA gives states more flexibility than they had under prior law, but still requires standards-based, largely assessment-driven accountability with a focus on the achievement of students in all demographic subgroups.
 
One important change brought about by ESSA is that states are now permitted to use growth in student achievement as measured by statewide assessments, in addition to grade-level proficiency, as an academic indicator for purposes of accountability. Instructional solutions that incorporate interim assessments and data analytics to help monitor student performance in real time can be especially useful in states that incorporate student growth as a significant element of their accountability systems. Other changes brought about by ESSA include a greater emphasis on English language learners, with progress towards English proficiency now a required element of state accountability plans, a requirement that products and solutions paid for with Federal education funds have evidence of effectiveness, and new requirements and expectations for Federally funded educator professional learning programs. The new law also gives states and school districts greater flexibility in how they spend Federal dollars and how they demonstrate that Federal funds are used to supplement and not supplant state and local spending.
 
Title I, the largest program within ESSA, and other ESSA programs also provide targeted funding for specific activities, such as early childhood education, school improvement, dropout prevention, and before- and after-school programs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. In addition, school districts in many states are now able to spend educational funds on “instructional materials” that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services.
 
Academic content standards, which are grade-level expectations for student learning, are established at the state level. States generally review and revise standards in each of the various subject areas every six to eight years, and the revision or adoption of new standards typically gives rise to the need for new instructional materials and services aligned to the new or revised standards. A large percentage of states have adopted the Common Core State Standards (“CCSS”) in English language arts and mathematics or standards largely based on the Common Core, and, as of December 2018, 19 states had adopted Next Generation Science Standards (“NGSS”). Both the CCSS and NGSS are products of state-led collaborations. The adoption of these standards has led to greater uniformity among states, but has not completely eliminated differences or the need for customized state-specific instructional materials.
 Internationally, we export and sell K-12 English language education products to premium private schools that utilize the U.S. curriculum, who are located primarily in Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. We also participate in the U.S. consumer book publishing market, which is estimated to be approximately $16.0 billion per year according to the Association of American Publishers. 
 Education net sales and billings are derived from Core Solutions and Extensions. Core Solutions products address the core curriculum market with grade-level, educational standards-aligned materials. Extensions products address the markets for supplemental programs, intervention programs, and professional learning. HMH Books & Media products primarily address the consumer book publishing market.

Market Segments 
 Core Curriculum 
 Our core curriculum offerings cover state-level educational standards within a subject and include a comprehensive offering of teacher and student materials necessary to conduct grade-level instruction throughout the entire school year. Products and services include students’ print and digital resources and a variety of supporting materials such as teacher’s editions, formative assessments, whole group instruction materials, practice aids and ancillary materials. 
 Core curriculum programs traditionally have been the primary resource for classroom instruction in most K-12 academic subjects, and as a result, enrollment trends are a major driver of industry growth. Although economic cycles may affect short-term buying patterns, school enrollments, a driver of growth in the educational content industry, are highly predictable and are expected to trend upward over the longer term. 
 Demand for core curriculum programs is also affected by changes in state curriculum standards, which drive instruction, assessment, and accountability in each state. A significant change in state curriculum standards requires that assessments, teacher training programs, and instructional materials be revised or replaced to align to the new standards, which historically has driven demand for new comprehensive curriculum programs. 
 In the U.S., core curriculum is typically selected and purchased at the school district level and, in some cases, at the individual school level. In 19 states, before districts make their selections, programs are first evaluated at the state level for alignment to state academic standards and other criteria. These states are commonly referred to as “adoption states,” while states that do not have a state level review process are called “open states” or “open territory states.” The student population in adoption states represented approximately 51% of the U.S. public school elementary and secondary school-age population in 2016 (the most recent year for which the National Center for Education Statistics has provided this data). In some adoption states, districts are required to select materials from the state-adopted list; in other adoption states, the state list serves as a recommendation, and districts are free to purchase and use any materials they choose, whether or not adopted by the state. Adoption states typically review materials in the various subject areas on a six- to eight-year cycle. School districts in those states tend to follow the state review cycle and replace core programs in the year or years immediately following state adoption. In open territory states, each individual school or school district evaluates and purchases materials independently, typically according to a five- to ten-year cycle. As a result, in individual adoption states, purchases of core instructional materials in a particular subject area tend to be clustered in a window of one to three years, while in individual open territory states they may occur over several years.
 Supplemental 
 Supplemental resources encompass a wide variety of targeted solutions that enrich learning and support student achievement beyond core curriculum. Supplemental resources can be print and/or digital, and can include software, workbooks, test-prep materials, formative assessment, games, and apps. Newer technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with more sophisticated algorithms are also driving the rise in supplemental computer-adaptive practice solutions that can both support teachers who are often time and bandwidth constrained, as well as improve personalization of learning for students. 
 Many teachers augment their core curriculum with supplemental resources for additional practice and personalized instruction around particular areas of need, such as Math, Reading, Writing, or Vocabulary. Supplemental materials are purchased by districts, schools, or individual teachers. These purchases are typically not tied to adoption schedules and leverage funding from local, state and federal sources. We estimate this market to be $2.0 billion per year.
 6

Intervention 
 Intervention solutions are generally purchased by individual schools or districts. Demand for intervention materials is significant and growing in the United States. We estimate this market to be $1.5 billion per year. In the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress assessments conducted in 2017, more than 60 percent of public school students performed below proficiency in both literacy and mathematics. These students are strong candidates for intervention programs that are focused on improving outcomes and ensuring students perform at grade level. As demand for digital content and personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring. 
 Intervention products and services are funded through state and local funding as well as federal funding allocations pursuant to the ESSA and IDEA. Title I provides funding to schools and school districts with high concentrations of students from low income families and is often used to purchase intervention products and services. 
 Professional Learning 
 The professional learning market includes consulting and support services to assist individual schools and school districts in raising student achievement, implementing new programs and technology effectively, developing effective teachers, principals and leaders, as well as school and school-district turnaround and improvement solutions. We believe all districts and schools contract for some level of professional services. These services may include support for up-front training, in-classroom coaching, institutes, author workshops, professional learning communities, leadership development, technical support and maintenance, and program management. 
 Professional learning is directly addressed in ESSA. ESSA restructured Title II, the section of the law addressing teacher quality, and eliminated federal “highly qualified teacher” requirements. ESSA prohibits U.S. Department of Education mandates and incentives to evaluate teachers based on student test scores, which in recent years have channeled resources and attention to the development of educator evaluation systems, measurement tools, and related training. Title II now focuses instead on the role of the profession in improving student achievement, including new requirements to ensure professional development is not only sustained (“no one-day workshops”), but also “job-embedded,” “data-driven,” and “personalized.” It is expected that school districts will need to focus their applications for teacher training to ensure teacher alignment with high quality standards, as well as priorities for funds to low-performing schools where comprehensive support and improvement plans are in place. There are also significant funding opportunities for professional learning as part of state programs, especially in states where they have consolidated program funding and want solutions that are “evidence-based.”
 The professional learning market, which is relatively fragmented in the United States, is expected to grow as the transition to digital learning in classrooms increases the need for technology training and implementation support for educators. We currently estimate the professional learning market to be $2.3 billion per year. We believe that the use of interim data, differentiation, teacher content knowledge (in mathematics) and the use of technology in the classroom are the areas in which teachers and leaders are most seeking support. Also, demand for teacher training and professional development opportunities tied to the implementation of new or revised standards at the state level is expected to continue. In addition, the need for new teacher development over the next several years is expected to grow as we continue to see the “greening” of the teaching force, with approximately 355,000 new teachers hired every year and approximately 44% of teachers leaving within their first five years in the profession. 
 Consumer Book Publishing 
 The consumer book publishing market includes children’s, fiction, non-fiction, culinary and reference titles offered to consumers in print hardcover and softcover, ebook and audio formats, as well as multimedia extensions of the titles, content and intellectual property associated with these titles. Our sales in this market consist of frontlist titles (newly introduced titles, in their first year of publication) and backlist titles (current and updated copyright editions of titles sold after their first year of publication). In addition to new frontlist sales, market growth is driven by extended branding (e.g., movie tie-ins and anniversary releases of backlist titles) and new intellectual property creation (e.g., extension of characters and franchises into additional formats).
 7

Between 2017 and 2018, the consumer book publishing market grew 1.5% to $16.2 billion, according to the Association of American Publishers (the “AAP”). Since 2014, the same market has increased by approximately $760 million according to the AAP.
 Over the last five years, non-fiction books have seen the largest percentage sales growth with children’s and young adult non-fiction sales growing 38.5% from 2014 to 2018 and adult non-fiction revenue growing 22.8% over the same time period, according to the AAP.
 Digital formats have gained traction in recent years with downloaded audio sales growing 28.7% from 2017 to 2018 and 181.8% from 2014 to 2018, according to the AAP. However, print remains the primary format in which consumer books are produced and distributed. Within online retail channels, which is where most books are sold, 45.1% of 2018 sales were in print; 24.5% were ebooks; and 13.7% were downloaded audio.

 HMH Books & Media 
 Founded in 1832, HMH Books & Media develops, markets and sells consumer books in print and digital formats and licenses book rights to other publishers and electronic businesses in the United States and abroad. Our principal distribution channels for this segment are retail stores (both physical and online) and wholesalers. Reference materials are also sold to schools, colleges, libraries, office supply distributors and other businesses. 
 HMH Books & Media offers an extensive library of general interest, young readers and reference works that include well-known characters and brands. Our award-winning general interest titles include literary fiction, culinary, and non-fiction in hardcover, ebook and paperback formats, including the Mariner Books paperback line. Among the general interest properties are the popular J.R.R. Tolkien titles, the prolific The Best American Series and major cookbook brands such as Betty Crocker and Better Homes and Gardens in addition to recent best sellers including the How to Cook Everything series and The Whole30. 
 In young readers publishing, our list addresses a broad age group and includes recognized characters and titles such as Curious George and Martha Speaks, Five Little Monkeys, Gossie & Friends, Polar Express, Little Blue Truck, and many more. We also publish novels for young adults, a growing genre, including titles from Lois Lowry, author of The Giver, and Kwame Alexander. Our HMH Books & Media business collaborated on the launch of a new animated series Carmen Sandiego on Netflix as part of our strategy to expand our content across media platforms. In February 2019, we also launched HMH Audio with the goal of capitalizing on the growth of downloaded audiobooks; in Fall 2019, we released new audiobook editions of many of our adult and young reader frontlist books, as well as select titles from our substantial backlist.
 For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, HMH Books & Media net sales and Adjusted EBITDA were approximately $180.0 million and $14.9 million, $199.7 million and $21.9 million, and $180.6 million and $12.1 million, respectively. 
 Seasonality 
 Approximately 87% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were derived from our Education segment, which is a markedly seasonal business. Schools conduct the majority of their purchases in the second and third quarters of the calendar year in preparation for the beginning of the school year. Thus, over the latest three completed fiscal years, approximately 67% of our consolidated net sales were realized in the second and third quarters. Sales of K-12 instructional materials are also cyclical, with some years offering more sales opportunities than others based on the state adoptions calendar. The amount of funding available at the state level for educational materials also has a significant effect on year-to-year net sales. Although the loss of a single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business, schedules of school adoptions and market acceptance of our products can materially affect year-to-year net sales performance. 
 10

Competition 
 We sell our products in highly competitive markets. In these markets, product quality, innovation and customer service are major differentiating factors between companies. Other factors affecting competition include: (i) competitive pricing, sampling and gratis costs; (ii) digitization and innovative delivery; and (iii) educational effectiveness of the program. In addition to national curriculum publishers, we also compete with a variety of specialized or regional publishers that focus on select disciplines and/or geographic regions in the K-12 market. There are also multiple competitors in the HMH Books & Media, supplemental and assessment markets offering content that school districts increasingly are using as part of their core classroom instructional materials. In addition, school districts in many states are able to spend educational funds on “instructional materials” that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. Our larger competitors in the educational market include Savvas Learning Co. (formerly Pearson Education, Inc.), McGraw Hill Education, Cengage Learning, Inc., Scholastic Corporation, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Curriculum Associates, LLC, Benchmark Education, LLC, Accelerate Learning, Inc., and Amplify Education, Inc. Also competing in our market as a substitute are open educational resources. These resources are free, digital solutions that range from supplemental resources to full Core Solutions programs. 
 Printing and binding; raw materials 
 We outsource the printing and binding of our products, with approximately 44% of our printing requirements handled by one major supplier. We have procurement agreements that provide volume and scheduling flexibility and price predictability. We have a longstanding relationship with these parties. Approximately 25% of our printed materials (consisting primarily of teacher’s editions and other ancillary components) are printed outside of the U.S. and approximately 75% of our printed materials (including most student editions) are printed within the U.S. Paper is one of our principal raw materials. We purchase our paper primarily through one paper merchant and also directly through suppliers for limited product types. We maintain various agreements that protect against supply availability and unbound price increases. We manage our paper supply concentration by having primary and secondary sources and staying ahead of dramatic market changes. 
 Distribution 
 We operate three distribution facilities from which we coordinate our own distribution process: one each in Indianapolis, Indiana; Geneva, Illinois; and Troy, Missouri. We also utilize select suppliers to assist us with coordinating the distribution process for a limited number of product types. Additionally, some adoption states require us to use in-state textbook depositories for educational materials sold in that particular state. We utilize various delivery firms, such as United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Freight, etc., to facilitate the principally ground transportation of products. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 3,400 employees, none of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These employees are substantially located in the United States with 235 employees located outside of the United States. We believe that relations with employees are generally good. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our principal intellectual property assets consist of our trademarks and copyrights in our content. Substantially all of our publications are protected by copyright, whether registered or unregistered, either in our name as the author of a work made for hire or the assignee of copyright, or in the name of an author who has licensed us to publish the work. Ownership of such copyrights secures the exclusive right to publish the work in the United States and in many countries abroad for specified periods: in the United States, in most cases, either 95 years from publication or for the author’s life plus 70 years, but in any event a minimum of 28 years for works published prior to 1978 and 35 years for works published thereafter. In most cases, the authors who retain ownership of their copyright have licensed to us exclusive rights for the full term of copyright. Under U.S. copyright law, for licenses granted by an author during or after 1978, such exclusive licenses are subject to termination by the author or certain of the author’s heirs for a five year period beginning at the end of 35 years after the date of publication of the work or 40 years after the date of the license grant, whichever term ends earlier. 
 11

We do not own any material patents, franchises or concessions, but we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in connection with our publishing businesses. We believe we have taken, and take in the ordinary course of business, appropriate available legal steps to reasonably protect our intellectual property in all material jurisdictions. 
 Environmental matters 
 We generally contract with independent printers and binders for their services, and our operations are generally not otherwise affected by environmental laws and regulations. However, as the owner and lessee of real property, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the remediation of contaminated sites and the handling and disposal of wastes. It is possible that we could face liability, regardless of fault, and can be held jointly or severally liable, if contamination were to be discovered on the properties that we own or lease or on properties that we have formerly owned or leased. We are currently unaware of any material environmental liabilities or other material environmental issues relating to our properties or operations and anticipate no material expenditures for compliance with environmental laws or regulations. 
 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
 As a corporate citizen, we accept and promote a community responsibility to minimize our impact on the environment to ensure that we will be able to serve teachers, students and all readers for years to come. As such, we seek to make environmentally responsible choices in our business practices.  We set objectives for continual improvement of our environmental and sustainability management procedures.  Looking ahead, we are working to expand our company-wide sustainability efforts, setting additional goals and measuring progress in other areas material to our business.
 Responsible Paper Usage
 One of our on-going sustainability focus areas is our approach to how we source, use and dispose of paper related to our products. In 2019, we strengthened and updated our Paper Sourcing and Usage Policy that reflects our continuing commitments to our environment and surroundings.  Key 2019 progress highlights were:  99% of HMH purchased paper for education products was manufactured with no less than 10% recycled fiber; 81% of paper we procured domestically for HMH Books & Media segment products was Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified; and 86% of the paper we procured internationally for HMH Books & Media segment products was FSC-certified.
Transportation 
 
A major aspect of our business involves the transportation of our products, and we work to promote environmentally friendly modes of such transportation.  In 2019, HMH estimates that it saved 964,000 pounds of CO2 by managing our carbon footprint by consolidating shipments, shipping directly from vendors to end recipients when possible and utilizing intermodal rail shipments. 
 
HMH participates in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) SmartWay program.  The EPA’s SmartWay program helps companies advance supply chain sustainability by measuring, benchmarking, and improving freight transportation efficiency.  Through this program, HMH partners with the EPA to improve our shipping operations to achieve a more sustainable transportation process that directly facilitates a reduction in our carbon footprint.  In 2019, HMH estimates that it saved 208,000 pounds of CO2 by participating in the SmartWay program.
 
Waste Management and Recycling 
 
Whenever possible, we aim to recycle our excess product and waste generated at our Distribution Centers to avoid sending recyclable products and other waste to landfills.
