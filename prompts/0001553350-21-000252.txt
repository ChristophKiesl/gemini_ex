ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. (the "registrant" or "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota in November 1990 under the name Fonahome Corporation. On March 24, 2009, the Company reincorporated in the state of Nevada and merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fona, Inc., adopting the surviving companys name, Fona, Inc. The Company was originally formed to develop and market an interactive information and advertising service.

From December 1999 through October 2015, the Company had no significant business operations. On March 3, 2009, the Company held a shareholder meeting approving the Stock Purchase Agreement and an Agreement and Plan of Merger effectively changing the name of the Company to Fona Inc., a Nevada corporation (Re-incorporation Merger) and simultaneously adopting the capital structure of Fona Inc., which includes total authorized capital stock of 800,000,000 shares, of which 780,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are blank check preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series with such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolutions adopted by the Corporations Board providing for the issuance of such preferred stock or series thereof. On March 24, 2009, the Articles of Merger of Fonahome Corporation, a Minnesota Corporation, into Fona, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.

On June 6, 2014, Evolutionary Genomics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (EG), EG I, LLC (EG I) and Fona, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Fona), Fona Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Sub) and Fona Merger Sub, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (Sub LLC), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 2, 2015 (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which, on October 19, 2015 Sub merged with EG and Sub LLC merged with EG I, with each EG and EG I surviving as wholly owned subsidiaries of Fona. For accounting purposes, the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition with Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. as the acquirer and Fona as the acquired party. Subsequent to the Merger, Fona, Inc. was renamed Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. and our subsidiary was renamed from Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. to EG Crop Science, Inc. On May 9, 2016, we formed ICAM Therapeutics, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) as a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. We have not incurred any transactions in this company nor have we established any business plan for the future.

The Company maintains headquarters at the office of its Chief Executive Officer. The Company maintains a website at www.evolgen.com. The Company is not required to deliver an annual report to security holders and at this time does not anticipate the distribution of such a report. The Company will file reports with the SEC.

GENERAL BUSINESS PLAN

On August 14, 2000, the Company was issued patent number 6274319, titled Methods to identify evolutionarily significant changes in polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences in domestic plants and animals. On June 1, 2004, the Company was issued patent number 6743580, titled Methods for producing transgenic plants containing evolutionarily significant polynucleotides. These patents are for the core Adapted Traits Platform that we use for the discovery of genes in humans, animals and commercial crops. The Company has applied the Adapted Traits Platform in research projects including identifying genes believed to be responsible for increases in yield in corn, increases in yield in rice, salt tolerance and sugar content in tomatoes and pest/disease resistance in soybeans, bananas and multiple other crops. 
EG Technology  The Adapted Traits Platform (ATP)

Genomics research generates vast amounts of sequence data for thousands of genes. Some companies use this sequence data to try to predict the function of each gene and its potential to impact key traits. Others try to match the thousands of random deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) changes between individuals with differences in traits. Evolutionary Genomics approach is to first narrow the search to genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (positively selected genes) in an organism that has an adapted trait of potential commercial value. To identify genes with impact on commercially desirable traits, Evolutionary Genomics screens first for positively selected genes. Evolutionary Genomics then focuses functional genomics efforts on demonstrating the effects of these genes on the desired traits.

Evolutionary Genomics uses the Adapted Traits Platform to perform high throughput molecular evolution analysis to identify positively selected genes based on Ka/Ks analysis (as defined below). Ka/Ks analysis was developed to document the role of positive selection on known protein coding genes. Molecular-level adaptive evolution is indicated when comparisons of homologous protein coding sequences from closely related species show that the number of amino acid differences fixed due to selection exceeds what can be expected by neutral evolution. Molecular-level positive selection can be detected in protein-coding genes by pairwise comparisons of the ratios of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks). The algorithm, by comparing substitutions per site, takes into account, in rigorous fashion, the effect of bias and degeneracy in the genetic code, and also compensates for the effects of multiple hits at the same site. Ka/Ks ratios significantly greater than unity strongly suggest that positive selection has fixed greater numbers of amino acid replacements than can be expected as a result of chance alone. 

Dr. Walter Messier, a Company founder and our Chief Technology Officer, published a seminal paper in the field: Messier and Stewart (1997) Episodic adaptive evolution of primate lysozymes Nature 385:151-154. The work described in this publication demonstrated that a known lysozyme gene that had been recruited for a new function to aid in digestion of leaves as a food source in certain monkeys had the kind of adaptive genetic changes indicating that the lysozyme gene had evolved more rapidly than the neutral substitution rate, indicating Darwinian positive selection. Many groups have used such methods to document Darwinian positive selection in other proteins. It was Dr. Messiers insight that genes controlling a trait of interest could be identified by using molecular evolution analysis as a screen, comparing genes in a species with a trait to genes of a closely related species lacking the trait. The adapted genes found in such a screen could then be validated to determine their role in the presence or absence of the trait of interest. 

Agricultural Industry

In the past century, agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, selective breeding, mechanization, water contamination, and farm subsidies. Proponents of organic farming such as Sir Albert Howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

Advances in genetic research and modification of crop species have led to increased yield, drought tolerance and disease/pest resistance. These advances have also led to an increased concentration within the providers of seed to the industry. The top seed companies control much of the implementation of new seed varieties through patents and licensing agreements. Genetic traits providers, like Evolutionary Genomics, identify and develop genes that impact traits of interest to the industry and market those genes to these seed companies.

Business Model

Evolutionary Genomics primary source of revenue through March 31, 2020 had been contract services revenue for research performed by Evolutionary Genomics on behalf of other commercial entities and grant income received from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations for research performed. Ownership of the intellectual property in these projects varies from Evolutionary Genomics retaining all intellectual property rights to retaining none of the developed intellectual property for the crop that is the subject of the project. In addition to contract services revenue for research, Evolutionary Genomics intends to continue to pursue grant funding from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations. These sources of funding are often subject to limitations in available funds, funding priorities in areas other than our area of focus, political uncertainties, long approval processes and competition with other research proposals.

The goal of the grant funded research projects was to discover genetic intellectual properties with commercial value. Evolutionary Genomics soybean pest resistance project is a multiple year illustration of the evolution of a project from concept through marketing to seed companies. The project has yielded identified genes for pest resistance in soybeans with partial validation complete and full validation results expected in mid-2021. Evolutionary Genomics has had discussions with seed companies to commercialize the soybean genes and intends to continue those discussions in 2021 with two generation, whole plant validation results. The Company has extended this soybean pest resistance research to other crops including beans, tomatoes, cotton and maize.

Licensing revenue can be lump sum payments, milestone payments upon achievement of defined goals and/or percentages of revenue for products sold by licensee. These payments are often many years after completion of gene identification project as licensees engage in significant additional testing including field trials prior to integration into licensee commercial germplasm lines. There can be no guarantee that these licensing agreements will result in any additional revenue for Evolutionary Genomics as further development of licensed intellectual property is mostly controlled by the licensee.

Our banana pest resistance project is another project illustration. We identified a gene (FusR1) in bananas that appears to confer resistance to Fusarium Fungus which leads to Panama Disease. We marketed the gene to banana companies and, in August 2020, executed a Development and Commercialization Agreement (DCA) with Dole Food Company (Dole) which includes three years of development work funded by Dole and the framework for a long-term licensing relationship. While Dole is supplying significant funding for the three year development of this banana gene in the form of promissory notes, there can be no assurance that this development work will lead to licensing revenue as there are many risks involved in genetic trait development.

Evolutionary Genomics Business Strategy

The single most valuable step in the process of crop improvement is the identification of the key genes among the 30,000 in the genome that has the desired impact. EG set out to find genes in soybeans that impact pest and disease resistance. We identified two that showed promise and, in hairy root assays on one of these genes, EG261, at the University of Wisconsin  Madison, proved that EG261 impacted resistance. When we discussed these results with the larger seed companies, they indicated interest but wanted to see two generation, whole plant testing results before entering licensing negotiations. We have engaged the University of Missouri and the University of Wisconsins Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center (WCIC) to independently perform these validation studies for us. 

As a small company restricted by our limited resources, we cannot afford to generate vast numbers of transformation plant lines, known as events. Moderate success is important enough to indicate that further optimization can lead to significantly improved results. We must prove that there is enough evidence to warrant additional trials by companies with vastly more resources to build on our success but the single most valuable step in this process is the identification of the gene that has the desired impact and we have identified two of these genes, EG261 and EG19.

On April 29, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent 8,710,300 titled EXPRESSION OF DIRIGENT GENE EG261 AND ITS ORTHOLOGS AND PARALOGS ENHANCES PATHOGEN RESISTANCE IN PLANTS. On December 5, 2017 and March 3, 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued additional patents which extended the previous patent to include additional variations of the gene. During 2017, the Company was issued similar patents in Canada, Brazil and China and has additional patents pending in Argentina and India. On January 16, 2020, the Company filed a patent application on its second soybean pest/disease resistance gene, EG19, and has included that gene in its ongoing two generation, whole plant validation research. The Company has also discovered additional candidate genes that may impact pathogen resistance. There can be no assurance that any of these genes will be proven effective in validation testing or lead to licensing agreements or revenue.

We entered into a Service Agreement with WCIC under which they have transformed soybeans using our genes and helped to establish the right combinations to achieve a range of expression. WCIC grew events from seven constructs of EG261 and EG19 in their greenhouses. These plants were harvested in May 2020 for generation T2 seeds. Covid-19 closures of laboratories delayed the commencement of testing of these seeds until November 2020. The testing of these T2 generation seedlings at the University of Missouri is expected to last until July 2021. 

If results from the whole plant validation trials confirm the findings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison for EG261 and the effectiveness of the new gene, EG19, the Company intends to enter negotiations for a long-term research collaboration and licensing agreement with seed companies. If these negotiations are successful, this type of agreement will likely have an upfront payment, milestone payments during their testing and a licensing royalty stream once the genes are incorporated into commercial seed lines. The testing phase includes field trials which may proceed for several years prior to generating licensing revenue. There are many risks in this process including some that are outside of Evolutionary Genomics control and there can be no guarantee that we will ever generate any revenue from these potential agreements. 

The Company has identified pest/disease resistance genes in other commercially valuable crops. The Company is in various stages of projects identifying genes in tomatoes and corn that may lead to increased pest/disease resistance. If successful, we intend to market them to the seed industry. 
This strategy will require Evolutionary Genomics to incur significant research costs prior to any confirmation of commercial viability and there can be no guarantee that the desired results can be achieved or that commercialization can be reached. 

During the 1950s the global banana industry was devastated by a disease (caused by Fusarium fungus) that effectively wiped out the predominate variety of commercial bananas know as Gros Michel leading to the development of the Cavendish banana, which makes up well over 90% of the commercial banana market today. Cavendish was resistant to the strain of Fusarium that wiped out the Gros Michel variety but, in recent years, is being challenged by a new race of Fusarium that threatens to, once again, devastate the global banana industry. This crisis is imminent and has no solution. The recent emergence of Panama Disease TR4 in the Western Hemisphere makes a swift solution to the crisis even more urgent. A substantial part of the banana market consists of exports from Central and South America to the United States.

In 2018, the Company began a project to identify genes in wild banana relatives that are resistant to Fusarium. We have previously used our technology to identify genes in common beans and, in our project for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in common beans, proved that these genes provided increased resistance to Fusarium fungus. We used our platform to isolate a banana gene that controls Fusarium Wilt (FW), aka Panama Disease, Tropical Race 4. The gene, which we have named FusR1 (Fusarium Resistance 1), is a native gene in Musa species, including cultivated bananas. We have found that, for all FW-resistant banana cultivars/species that we have tested, one version of our gene exists while, in all FW-sensitive banana cultivars/species that we have tested, there is a different version of FusR1. And notably, a third version exists in semi-resistant varieties that has allowed us to identify the particular nucleotide changes that are crucial for resistance to Fusarium Wilt. 

We believe that this native banana gene can be introduced into cultivated bananas, particularly the Fusarium-sensitive Cavendish cultivar in order to make these cultivars resistant to Fusarium Wilt. Cavendish cultivars are sterile and seedless, but it should be possible to use MAB (marker assisted breeding), though perhaps difficult and time-consuming, to move FusR1 into Cavendish and other cultivated bananas. We believe that a gene transformation approach would be faster and easier. Given the threat of possible extinction for Cavendish, rapid approaches are not only warranted but essential and minimally genetically edited bananas will be accepted depending upon how the gene transfer is accomplished. Transfer of this native banana gene to cultivated bananas can also be accomplished with CRISPR technology, which allows a targeted, clean, and efficient transfer and which, as compared to more traditional genetic editing techniques, minimizes potential side effects. We believe that Cavendish bananas can be rendered Fusarium Wilt resistant by changing only a few base pairs. These sorts of minimal changes have been allowed by the USDA and FDA in several crops. Even in Europe, use of CRISPR technology has gained substantial traction. 

On June 26, 2019, we filed a United States patent application titled IDENTIFICATION AND RESISTANCE GENES FROM WILD RELATIVES OF BANANA AND THEIR USES IN CONTROLLING PANAMA DISEASE. We are awaiting review of these patents by the United States Patent Office.

On August 19, 2020, the Company entered into the DCA with Dole for the development of plant varieties within the Musa genus of the Musaceae family (including the Cavendish variety of banana) that exhibit resistance to Fusarium Wilt Tropical Race 4 (popularly known as Panama Disease). Subject to compliance with various provisions of the agreement, the agreement includes working capital funding from Dole to the Company over the next four years. In addition to working capital funding, Dole will reimburse the Company for the development of banana plants and incur additional costs for the commercialization of plants upon successful completion of the development portion of this project. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received $800,000 of working capital funding and $1,295,831 of reimbursement of development costs pursuant to this agreement. Per the Agreement, 50% of future royalties may be offset with the research funding provided by Dole. In the event that Dole terminates the agreement for material breach by the Company or the Companys bankruptcy, the Company must repay all funding provided by Dole within six months of termination. The parties have agreed to negotiate the terms of the long-term license agreement upon successful completion of the development portion of this project. We expect that the funding from these sources will be more than enough to cover our operating expenses for the next twelve months. If the funding does not arrive per the agreement, the Company may not be able to meet its obligations as they become due.

If we are able to successfully transform and validate our banana genes, which will likely take 24-36 months from the start of the project in September 2020, under the terms of the agreement with Dole, we expect to negotiate a long-term royalty contract for the commercialization of banana plants using our genes. This licensing arrangement will likely be exclusively with Dole and contain royalty payments based on the number of plants and/or hectares of plants. Even if EGs genes are proven to be effective, it is difficult to predict the future revenue stream that any licensing arrangement can generate and will be heavily dependent upon the speed with which Panama Disease spreads throughout the world necessitating a solution and any changes in the price of bananas based on supply and demand. Many articles are available in the public realm detailing the significance of the disease and the spread throughout the world.

Since bananas are seedless, they are propagated by clones which allows for very rapid production of plants. An initial batch of 100 successful plants can generate a secondary propagation of over 15,000 plants in one year (enough for 10 hectares) and 15 million in the next generation. There are over 400,000 hectares of banana production in Latin America from Mexico to Peru. Adoption of the new variety will be dependent upon its effectiveness and the infection rate of Panama disease.

There are many risks associated with achieving these desired results including but not limited to:


- | We may not be able to adequately establish patent protection for our intellectual property or others may have competing claims. 
- | Others may develop competitive approaches to compete with our genes. 
- | Our transformation academic labs may fail to develop enough events for testing. 
- | Our genes may cause unforeseen and undesirable changes beyond the pest resistance such as yield degradation or changes in the appearance or taste of the fruit. 
- | Our genes may fail to deliver the desired results of resistance to Fusarium. 
- | Globally regulations and/or consumer preference may prevent the successful commercial launch of bananas with genetics changed using our methods. 
- | We will be dependent on others for the successful production and marketing of bananas with our genes and many factors will be outside of our control. 
- | Our cash flow is highly dependent upon our only expected source of funding provided under our Development and Commercialization Agreement with Dole Food Company. 
- | Our expected future royalty revenue will be highly dependent upon the successful execution of the banana development project in the DCA with Dole and the negotiation of a long-term royalty licensing agreement expected in the third year of that agreement.

Competition

Evolutionary Genomics competition is very broad from the largest seed companies like Monsanto Company, Syngenta AG, Bayer Crop Science, Dupont Pioneer and Dow and others to the smallest grower who is successful in breeding new, improved varieties. These same competitors are also Evolutionary Genomics customers as Evolutionary Genomics seeks to license intellectual property for commercialization into their seed lines. Many of these companies are exponentially larger with many more resources at their disposal and there can be no assurance that EG can continue to compete with them or interest them in licensing our intellectual property.

Material Agreements

Effective March 1, 2012, Evolutionary Genomics entered into an Agreement for Contract Services with Smith Bucklin Corporation (the Contractor) on behalf of the United Soybean Board. The contract includes the payment of certain royalties, as defined in the Agreement. Evolutionary Genomics retains all ownership of patents and intellectual property developed in the project and is obligated to pay royalties to the United Soybean Board of ten percent of the sale of products derived from the soybean genes that were the subject of the research performed or from royalties received from the sale of products by a third party not to exceed 150% of the total amount paid to Evolutionary Genomics under this Agreement. Evolutionary Genomics recognized revenue of $262,476 from this contract, thus limiting any future royalties to a total of $393,714. The project term has expired but the royalty provisions remain in perpetuity. 

On February 21, 2015 the Company entered into the Sponsored Research Contract with The Curators of the University of Missouri for phenotyping of transgenic soybean samples on a per unit basis. We expect to continue this contract and will likely have additional amounts payable but the amount is indeterminable. Evolutionary Genomics retains sole ownership of all patents and intellectual property, royalty free for all materials (including previously identified genes) related to this project. 

On May 3, 2018 and amended on January 9, 2019, the Company entered into a Service Agreement with WCIC for the transformation and development of transgenic soybean plants using our EG261 and EG19 genes. Including the amendment, the total amount of this contract is $141,631, all of which has been recognized through December 31, 2020. Evolutionary Genomics will retain sole ownership of all patents and intellectual property, royalty free for all materials (including previously identified genes). 

On June 26, 2018, the Company was awarded an Advanced Industries Accelerated Grant by the State of Colorado in the amount of $250,000 to fund further research in the development of pest resistance genes in soybeans and other crops and sweetness genes in tomatoes. Through December 31, 2020, the Company has recognized all $250,000 of the revenue from the contract. The Company maintains ownership of all intellectual property developed from the use of the grant funds and is not required to repay grant funds or pay royalties.

On August 19, 2020, the Company entered into the DCA with Dole for the development of our banana genes. The DCA provides for payments from Dole to the Company of $800,000 upon execution, $800,000 by the twelve-month anniversary, $250,000 by the thirty-six month anniversary and $250,000 by the forty-eight month anniversary. Dole will also reimburse the Company for costs incurred at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) not to exceed $2,200,000 in coordination with the Standard Research Agreement that the Company entered into with UW on September 18, 2020 which includes payments from the Company to UW in the amount of $2,159,719 over the two-year expected term of the project. If the UW research is successful, Dole expects to incur costs of $750,000 to perform field trials.

The DCA also specifies that the Company will execute notes payable to Dole for the funding that Dole is providing up to $5,050,000. 
Upon receipt of the first $800,000 on August 26, 2020, the Company executed the first note under this DCA and recorded it as a long term note payable for financial statement purposes. Upon receipt of $1,295,831 on December 29, 2020, the Company executed the second note under this DCA and recorded it as a long term note payable for financial statement purposes. The notes are non-interest bearing and allow Dole to offset fifty percent of future royalty payments to the Company by reducing the amount of principal due on these notes. Other than this offset of future royalty payments, repayment of principal and interest is only required in the case of termination of the DCA by Dole for cause.

On September 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Standard Research Agreement with WCIC for the development of our banana genes. The agreement includes payments from the Company in the amount of $2,159,719 over the two-year expected term of the project. These costs will be reimbursed, in the form of notes payable by Dole in accordance with our DCA.
