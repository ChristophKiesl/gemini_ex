In addition, our European manufacturing operations produce flat cars, cars for coil steel and metals, gondolas, intermodal cars, sliding wall cars, hoppers and automobile transport cars. 
Marine Vessel Fabrication - We manufacture a broad range of Jones Act ocean-going and river barges for transporting merchandise between ports within the United States. Our primary focus is on the larger ocean-going vessels although we have the capability to compete in other marine-related products. Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility, located on a deep-water port on the Willamette River, includes marine vessel fabrication capabilities.
 Wheels, Repair & Parts Segment
 Wheel Services - We operate a wheel services network in North America. Our wheel shops provide complete wheel services including reconditioning of wheels and axles in addition to new axle machining, finishing and downsizing. Through a joint venture partnership we also provide axle machining, finishing and downsizing.
 Railcar Maintenance - We operate a railcar maintenance network in North America including shops certified by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Our shops perform routine railcar maintenance for third parties and for our leased and managed railcar fleets. 
 Component Parts Manufacturing - Our component parts facilities recondition and manufacture railcar cushioning units, couplers, yokes, side frames, bolsters and various other parts. We also produce roofs, doors and associated parts for boxcars.  
Leasing & Services Segment
 In February 2021 we announced a refined leasing strategy to grow our owned portfolio of leased railcars by approximately $200 million a year to create an incremental annuity stream of tax-advantaged cash flows while reducing our exposure to the new railcar order and delivery cycle. We are executing this strategy through GBX Leasing, a joint venture in which we own approximately 95%. GBX Leasing commenced operations in April 2021. GBX Leasing is financed with non-recourse debt and is expected to be levered approximately 3:1 debt to equity. We intend that GBX Leasing will aggregate leased railcars to obtain term or capital market financing. GBX Leasing is consolidated for financial reporting purposes within the Leasing & Services segment. Greenbrier Management Services provides management services to the GBX Leasing fleet. 
 Leasing - We operate a railcar leasing business in North America. Our relationships with financial institutions and operating lessors combined with our ownership of a lease fleet of approximately 8,800 railcars, which includes GBX Leasing, enables us to offer flexible financing programs to our customers including operating leases of varied intervals and “per diem” leases. The percentage of owned units on lease was 94.1% at August 31, 2021 with an average remaining lease term of 3.6 years and an average age of 5.1 years. We also originate leases of railcars, which are either newly built or refurbished by our operations, or bought in the secondary market, and sell the railcars and attached leases to financial institutions or other investors, typically with multi-year management services agreements. As an equipment owner and an originator of leases, we participate principally in the operating lease segment of the market. Under the majority of our leases, we are responsible for maintenance and administration of the leased cars. Assets from our owned lease fleet are periodically sold to accommodate customer demand, manage risk and maintain liquidity.
 Management Services - Our North American management services business offers a broad array of software and services that include railcar maintenance management, railcar accounting services (such as billing and revenue collection, car hire receivable and payable administration), total fleet management (including railcar tracking using proprietary software), fleet logistics, administration and railcar re-marketing. We currently provide management services for a fleet of approximately 444,000 railcars for railroads, shippers, carriers, institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in North America. In addition, our Regulatory Services Group offers regulatory, engineering, process consulting and advocacy support to the tank car and petrochemical rail shipper community, among other services.

Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 U.S. Axle Manufacturing - We have a 41.9% interest in Axis, LLC (Axis), a joint venture that manufactures and sells axles to its joint venture partners for use and distribution both domestically and internationally in traditional freight railcar markets and other railcar markets. 
Brazilian Railcar Manufacturing - We have a 60% ownership interest in Greenbrier Maxion-Equipamentos e Serviços Ferroviários S.A. (Greenbrier-Maxion), the leading railcar manufacturer in South America, located near São Paulo, Brazil. Greenbrier-Maxion also assembles bogies and offers a range of aftermarket services including railcar overhaul and refurbishment.  
 Brazilian Castings and Component Parts Manufacturing - We have a 29.5% ownership interest in Amsted-Maxion Fundição e Equipamentos Ferroviários S.A. (Amsted-Maxion) based in Cruzeiro, Brazil. Amsted-Maxion is a manufacturer of various castings and components for railcars and other heavy industrial equipment.  Amsted-Maxion has a 40% ownership position in Greenbrier-Maxion and is integrated with the operations of our Brazilian railcar manufacturer. 
 Other Unconsolidated Affiliates - We have other unconsolidated affiliates which primarily include joint ventures that produce rail and industrial components. 
 Backlog
 The following table depicts our reported railcar backlog subject to third party sale or lease in number of railcars and estimated future revenue value attributable to such backlog, at the dates shown:

 | August 31, | 
-------------------------------------------------+------------+-------
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
New railcar backlog units (1) | | 26,600 | | | 24,600 | | | 30,300
Estimated future revenue value (in millions) (2) | $ | 2,810 | | $ | 2,420 | | $ | 3,280 


(1) | Each platform of a railcar is treated as a separate unit.
----+----------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Subject to change based on finalization of product mix.
----+--------------------------------------------------------

 Approximately 7% of backlog units and 6% of estimated backlog value as of August 31, 2021 was associated with our Brazilian manufacturing operation which are accounted for under the equity method. 
 Based on current production schedules, approximately 14,500 units in the August 31, 2021 backlog are scheduled for delivery in 2022. The balance of the production is scheduled for delivery in 2023 and beyond. 
 Backlog units for lease may be syndicated to third parties or held in our own fleet depending on a variety of factors. Multi-year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice. A portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix. Under terms of the orders, the exact mix and pricing will be determined in the future, which may impact backlog. Marine backlog was $70 million and $51 million as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Our backlog of railcar units and marine vessels is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Certain orders in backlog are subject to customary documentation and completion of terms. Customers may attempt to cancel or modify orders in backlog. Historically, little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered, though the timing of deliveries may be modified from time to time. 
 Customers
 Customers across our segments include railroads, leasing companies, financial institutions, shippers, carriers and transportation companies. We have strong, long-term relationships with many of our customers. We believe that our customers’ preference for high quality products, our technological leadership in developing innovative products, our focus on being highly responsive to our customer’s needs and competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers.

In 2021, revenue from two customers accounted for approximately 26% of total revenue which represented 33% of Manufacturing revenue, 7% of Leasing & Services revenue and 2% of Wheels, Repair & Parts revenue. No other customers accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue.
 
Raw Materials and Components
 Our products require a supply of materials including steel and specialty components such as brakes, wheels and axles. Specialty components purchased from third parties represent a significant amount of the cost of most freight cars. Our customers often specify particular components and suppliers of such components. Although the number of alternative suppliers of certain specialty components has declined in recent years, there are at least two available suppliers for each of these components. 
 Certain materials and components are periodically in short supply which could potentially impact production at our new railcar and refurbishment facilities. We experienced an increase in the price and shortages of certain materials and components during 2021, in particular the cost of steel. In an effort to mitigate shortages and reduce supply chain costs, we have entered into strategic alliances and multi-year arrangements for the global sourcing of certain materials and components, we operate a replacement parts business which aids in our vertical integration and we continue to pursue strategic opportunities to protect and enhance our supply chain. We periodically make advance purchases to avoid possible shortages of material due to capacity limitations of component suppliers, shipping and transportation delays and possible price increases. 
 In 2021, the top ten suppliers for all inventory purchases accounted for approximately 47% of total purchases. The top supplier accounted for 18% of total inventory purchases in 2021. No other suppliers accounted for more than 10% of total inventory purchases. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers.
 Competition
 We are currently one of the two largest railcar manufacturers competing in North America. There are also a handful of specialty builders who focus on niche markets. We believe that in Europe we are in the top tier of railcar manufacturers. Through our 60% ownership interest in Greenbrier-Maxion, we are the leading railcar manufacturer in South America. The railcar manufacturing industry is becoming more global as customers are purchasing railcars from manufacturers outside of their geographic region. In all railcar markets that we serve, we compete on the basis of quality, price, reliability of delivery, product design and innovation, reputation and customer service and support.
 Competition in the marine industry is dependent on the type of product produced, proximity to delivery point, and manufacturing capacity. There are few competitors that build as wide an array of products types as we build. We compete on the basis of price, quality, reliability of delivery, launching capacity and experience with certain product types.
 Competition in the Wheels, Repair & Parts businesses is dependent on the type of product or service provided. There are many competitors in these businesses. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, timeliness of delivery, customer service, location of shops, price and engineering expertise.
 There are at least twenty institutions in North America that provide railcar leasing and/or services similar to ours. Many of them are also customers that buy new railcars from our manufacturing facilities and used railcars from our lease fleet, as well as utilize our management and maintenance services. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, price, delivery, reputation, service offerings and deal structuring and syndication ability. We believe our strong servicing capability and our ability to sell railcars with a lease attached (syndicate railcars), integrated with our manufacturing, maintenance shops, railcar specialization and expertise in particular lease structures provide a strong competitive advantage.

Marketing and Product Development
 In North America, we leverage an integrated marketing and sales effort to coordinate relationships in our various segments. We provide our customers with a diverse range of equipment and financing alternatives designed to satisfy each customer’s unique needs, whether the customer is buying new equipment, refurbishing existing equipment or seeking to outsource the maintenance or management of equipment. These custom programs may involve a combination of railcar products, leasing, refurbishing and remarketing services. In addition, we provide customized maintenance management, equipment management, accounting and compliance services and proprietary software solutions.
 
In Europe and South America, we maintain relationships with customers through market-specific sales personnel. Our engineering and technical staff works closely with their customer counterparts on the design and certification of railcars. Many European railroads are state-owned and are subject to European Union (EU) regulations covering the tender of government contracts.
 Through our research and customer relationships, insights are derived into the potential need for new products and services. Marketing and engineering personnel collaborate to evaluate opportunities and develop new products and features. Research and development costs incurred during the years ended August 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $6.3 million, $5.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively.
 Human Capital
 With the oversight of the Board, our CEO and senior leadership are thoughtfully invested in our global workforce. We regularly review our priorities and progress in each of the areas highlighted below. 
 Safety - We continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on a safe and healthy work environment for our global employees. Our safety performance is monitored regularly by senior leadership and our Board. We are proud of the sustained improvement in our safety statistics even while we have experienced significant fluctuations in headcount over the past 18 months.
Talent and Diversity - We recognize that a talented and diverse workforce is critical to our success. This year we continued our focus on leadership development and expanded our talent programs to include development for emerging leaders throughout our company, as well as invested in training and learning resources for employees at all levels in the organization. Employees are encouraged to invest their time and energy into these opportunities. 
 
Building upon our core value of Respect for People, we formally launched our IDEAL (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access and Leadership) commitment in the fall of 2020. We established a strategy, action plan and a roadmap to guide continual progress and achievement of measurable goals. Our IDEAL commitment is supported by our Board, senior leadership and a recently-constituted Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Committee (DISC). IDEAL has been embraced throughout our company.
 
Compensation and Benefits - We are facing an unusually competitive compensation environment which could impact our ability to attract and retain talent. To remain competitive and attract and retain top talent globally, we are evaluating our compensation programs. This includes reviewing base pay levels for equity both internally and externally and assessing the effectiveness of our short and long-term incentive programs. In addition, we strive to provide competitive health and wellness programs to our employees.
 
The items above support our overall emphasis on attracting a diverse talent base and fostering an inclusive culture for our global workforce.

The following table summarizes the approximate number of employees by segment as of August 31, 2021 at our consolidated entities:
 
 
 | Number of Employees | 
----------------------------------------+---------------------+-------
Manufacturing | | 9,400 
Wheels, Repair & Parts | | 600 
Leasing & Services (Includes Corporate) | | 300 
Total Employees | | 10,300

 
While our total number of employees at the end of August 31, 2021 remained relatively consistent with the headcount at August 31, 2020, we experienced a significant decline in the number of our employees during most of 2021 as volumes declined and strategic spending reductions were implemented. However, as production rates and volumes began to increase as we approached August 31, 2021, we increased our headcount to meet increasing demand.
 
In Manufacturing, 4,900 employees are represented by unions. At our Wheels, Repair & Parts locations, approximately 40 employees are represented by a union. 
 Patents and Trademarks
 We have a proactive program aimed at protecting our intellectual property and the results from our research and development. We have obtained a number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents of varying duration, and pending patent applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names. We believe that manufacturing expertise, the improvement of existing technology and the development of new products are at least as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage in our market. 
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions, wastewater discharge, solid and hazardous waste disposal and employee health and safety. Prior to acquiring facilities, we conduct investigations to evaluate the environmental condition of subject properties and may negotiate contractual terms for allocation of environmental exposure arising from prior uses. We operate our facilities in a manner designed to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental studies have been conducted on certain of our owned and leased properties that indicate additional investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be necessary.
Portland Harbor Superfund Site
 Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility (the Portland Property) is located adjacent to the Willamette River. In December 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified portions of the Willamette River bed known as the Portland Harbor, including the portion fronting our manufacturing facility, as a federal "National Priority List" or "Superfund" site due to sediment contamination (the Portland Harbor Site). Our company and more than 140 other parties have received a "General Notice" of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised us that we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation (which liability may be joint and several with other potentially responsible parties) as well as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. Ten private and public entities, including our company (the Lower Willamette Group or LWG), signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) of the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several additional entities did not sign such consent, but nevertheless contributed financially to the effort. The EPA-mandated RI/FS was produced by the LWG and cost over $110 million during a 17-year period. We bore a percentage of the total costs incurred by the LWG in connection with the investigation. Our aggregate expenditure during the 17-year period was not material. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. The EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) for the Portland Harbor Site on January 6, 2017 and accordingly on October 26, 2017, the AOC was terminated.
 9


Separate from the process described above, which focused on the type of remediation to be performed at the Portland Harbor Site and the schedule for such remediation, 83 parties, including the State of Oregon and the federal government, entered into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs associated with remediation of the Portland Harbor Site. Approximately 110 additional parties signed tolling agreements related to such allocations. On April 23, 2009, our company and the other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema Inc. et al v. A & C Foundry Products, Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Case #3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice, and the case has been stayed by the court until January 14, 2022.
 The EPA's January 6, 2017 ROD identifies a clean-up remedy that the EPA estimates will take 13 years of active remediation, followed by 30 years of monitoring with an estimated undiscounted cost of $1.7 billion. The EPA typically expects its cost estimates to be accurate within a range of -30% to +50%, but this ROD states that changes in costs are likely to occur as a result of new data collected over a 2-year period prior to final remedy design. The ROD identifies 13 Sediment Decision Units. One of the units, RM9W, includes the nearshore area of the river sediments offshore of the Portland Property as well as upstream and downstream of the facility. It also includes a portion of our company’s riverbank. The ROD does not break down total remediation costs by Sediment Decision Unit. The EPA's ROD concluded that more data was needed to better define clean-up scope and cost. On December 8, 2017, the EPA announced that Portland Harbor is one of 21 Superfund sites targeted for greater attention. On December 19, 2017, the EPA announced that it had entered a new AOC with a group of four potentially responsible parties to conduct additional sampling during 2018 and 2019 to provide more certainty about clean-up costs and aid the mediation process to allocate those costs. The parties to the mediation, including us, agreed to help fund the additional sampling, which is now complete. The EPA requested that potentially responsible parties enter AOCs during 2019 agreeing to conduct remedial design studies. Some parties have signed AOCs, including one party with respect to RM9W which includes the area offshore of our manufacturing facility. We have not signed an AOC in connection with remedial design, but will potentially be directly or indirectly responsible for conducting or funding a portion of such RM9W remedial design. The allocation process is continuing in parallel with the process to define the remedial design. 
 The ROD does not address responsibility for the costs of clean-up, nor does it allocate such costs among the potentially responsible parties. Responsibility for funding and implementing the EPA's selected cleanup remedy will be determined at an unspecified later date. Based on the investigation to date, we believe that we did not contribute in any material way to contamination in the river sediments or the damage of natural resources in the Portland Harbor Site and that the damage in the area of the Portland Harbor Site adjacent to our property precedes our ownership of the Portland Property. Because these environmental investigations are still underway, sufficient information is currently not available to determine our liability, if any, for the cost of any required remediation or restoration of the Portland Harbor Site or to estimate a range of potential loss. Based on the results of the pending investigations and future assessments of natural resource damages, we may be required to incur costs associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, we may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels from its launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River, and the river's classification as a Superfund site could result in some limitations on future dredging and launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business and Consolidated Financial Statements, or the value of the Portland Property.
 On January 30, 2017 the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation sued 33 parties including our company as well as the U.S. and the State of Oregon for costs it incurred in assessing alleged natural resource damages to the Columbia River from contaminants deposited in Portland Harbor. Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation v. Air Liquide America Corp., et al., U.S. Court for the District of Oregon Case No. 3i17-CV-00164-SB. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages the plaintiff will seek. The case has been stayed until January 14, 2022. 
 Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Regulation of Portland Manufacturing Operations
 We entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in which we agreed to conduct an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present operations at the Portland Property may have released hazardous substances into the environment. We have also signed an Order on Consent with the DEQ to finalize the investigation of potential onsite sources of contamination that may have a release pathway to the Willamette River. Interim precautionary measures are also required in the order and the Company is discussing 
 10


with the DEQ potential remedial actions which may be required. Our aggregate expenditure has not been material, however we could incur significant expenses for remediation. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. 
 Regulation
 We must comply with the rules of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the administrative agencies it oversees including the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. and Transport Canada (TC) in Canada, each of which administer and enforce laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. More specifically, the transportation of hazardous materials by rail is subject to rigorous oversight by FRA, PHMSA, and DHS. Railroads, acting through the Association of American Railroads (AAR), work in partnership with these and other local, state, and federal entities on hazardous materials-related issues, including train routing, security, tank car design and emergency response. Railroads also require compliance with certain industry best practices which at times exceed federal requirements for trains carrying hazardous materials. These regulations govern equipment and safety appliance standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate and international commerce throughout North America. The AAR promulgates rules and regulations governing the safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads and other railcar owners with respect to railcars in interchange, and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on North American railroads. These regulations require maintaining certifications with the AAR as a railcar builder and maintenance provider and component manufacturer, and products sold and leased by us in North America must meet AAR, TC, PHMSA and FRA standards.
 The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the ocean-going barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration of the USDOT, and private industry classing organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. 
 Our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social ("STPS") in Mexico. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims asserted against us for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
 The regulatory environment in Europe consists of a combination of EU regulations and country specific regulations, including a harmonized set of Technical Standards for Interoperability of freight wagons throughout the EU. The regulatory environment in Brazil consists of oversight from the Ministry of Infrastructure, the National Agency of Ground Transportation and the National Association of Railroad Transporters. In all other countries, we conform to country specific regulations where applicable.
