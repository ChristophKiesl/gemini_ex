Item 1. Business
Bentley Systems: The Infrastructure Engineering Software Company
We are a leading global provider of software for infrastructure engineering, enabling the work of civil, structural, geotechnical, and plant engineering practitioners, their project delivery enterprises, and owner‑operators of infrastructure assets. We were founded in 1984 by the Bentley brothers. Our enduring commitment is to develop and support the most comprehensive portfolio of integrated software offerings across professional disciplines, project and asset lifecycles, infrastructure sectors, and geographies. Our software enables digital workflows across engineering disciplines, distributed project teams, from offices to the field, and across computing form factors, including desktops, on-premises servers, cloud-native services, mobile devices, and web browsers. We deliver our solutions via on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. Our users engineer, construct, and operate projects and assets across the following infrastructure sectors:
•public works (including roads, rail, airports, ports, and water and wastewater networks)/utilities (including electric, gas, water, and communications). We estimate that this sector represents 51% of the net infrastructure asset value of the global top 500 infrastructure owners (the “global top 500 infrastructure owners”) based on the 2020 edition of the Bentley Infrastructure 500 Top Owners, our annual compilation of the world’s largest infrastructure owners ranked by net depreciated value of their tangible fixed assets;
•industrial (including discrete and process manufacturing, power generation, and water treatment plants)/resources (including oil and gas, mining, and offshore). We estimate that this sector represents 37% of the global top 500 infrastructure owners’ net infrastructure asset value; and
•commercial/facilities (including office buildings, hospitals, and campuses). We estimate that this sector represents 12% of the global top 500 infrastructure owners’ net infrastructure asset value.
We address both the project and asset lifecycle phases of infrastructure, each with applications and enterprise information systems. Our Project Lifecycle solutions encompass conception, planning, surveying, design, engineering, simulation, and construction, as well as the collaboration offerings required to coordinate and share the work of interdisciplinary and/or distributed project teams. Our Asset Lifecycle solutions span the operating life of commissioned infrastructure assets, allowing our accounts to manage engineering changes for safety and compliance and to model performance and reliability to support operating and maintenance decisions.
Our Solutions
We offer solutions for enterprises and professionals across the infrastructure lifecycle. Our Project Delivery and Asset and Network Performance solutions are systems provided via cloud and hybrid environments, developed respectively to extend enterprise collaboration during project delivery, and to manage and leverage engineering information during operations and maintenance. Our Design Integration and Digital Cities solutions are primarily desktop applications and cloud-provisioned solutions for professional practitioners and workgroups. Our cloud-native Digital Twins solutions introduce digital workflows, which can span our Project Lifecycle and Asset Lifecycle solutions.
Project Lifecycle Solutions. Our Project Lifecycle solutions span conception, planning, surveying, design, simulation, and construction, as well as the collaboration software services required to coordinate and share the work of interdisciplinary and/or distributed project teams.
Design Integration. Our Design Integration solutions consist of modeling and simulation applications. Our modeling applications are domain-specific authoring tools used by professionals for the 3D design and documentation of infrastructure assets. Our simulation applications enable engineers to analyze the functional performance of the designs created with our modeling applications (or those of competitive vendors), preferably in iterative digital workflows, to improve engineering outcomes and to ensure compliance with design codes.
Benefits of our Design Integration applications to infrastructure engineers include:
•Better designs. Our modeling and simulation applications work together to improve infrastructure engineering quality, for instance to eliminate “clashes” across respective disciplines’ work. Each application is for a specific purpose (asset-type or discipline; for example, OpenRoads for roadway design), and supports corresponding asset-specific engineering workflows (for example, the workflow a civil engineer would use in designing a road) by virtue of:
•Better engineering productivity. We endeavor to provide in our applications the most advanced and automated intelligence for transforming engineers’ conceptual decisions into complete, detailed, and editable deliverables; and
•Better configurability and continuity. We take care to enable users to continuously refine their modeling preferences and standards across successive generations of our applications. This capability enables engineers, throughout their careers, to maintain continuity and compatibility with their preferred interfaces, formats, and methodologies, while advancing their work at the leading edge of innovation;
•Better deliverables. Our applications share a common modeling environment to enable streamlined coordination and production of multi-discipline documentation; and
•Better handoff. Our comprehensive modeling environment and our supplemental cloud services enable projects to enrich information sharing (and to minimize problematic translations) across project delivery processes. For instance:
•by starting with reality modeling of existing conditions (often from drone surveying);
•by sharing engineering component definitions across disciplines and projects; and
•through “constructioneering” digital workflows, which automate the exchange of 3D design models to control GPS-enabled construction equipment (for earthmoving and paving), and to validate and preserve the resulting 3D as‑built models for maintenance.
Project Delivery. Our Project Delivery solutions support information and document management, engineering‑specific collaboration and work‑sharing for distributed project teams and enterprises, and construction planning, modeling and execution. The scope of these solutions is not limited to users of only our own design applications.
Often during the project delivery lifecycle, key data are constantly changing, with inputs received from multiple sources, resulting in the need for a single source of information that is used to collect, manage, and disseminate information for the whole project team. Our software assures that the rapidly-changing data are managed in a common data environment (“CDE”) such that only the correct milestone versions can be shared and referenced across the project. This functionality enables infrastructure project organizations to “virtualize” their talent so that the required work can be shared by all participants everywhere through our software, reducing the need for physical co-location of the project resources.
Our 4D construction modeling software spatially and temporally integrates a project’s 3D engineering models into its construction schedules to assess sequencing strategies and to visualize and understand planned and actual progress over the project timeline. Our solutions also enable project delivery teams to optimally define and manage discrete engineering, construction, and installation work packages, including the construction trades’ “workface planning,” which considers crafts and materials by day and zone. For work packages which increasingly take advantage of modular offsite fabrication and manufacturing, our software manages and enables 4D visualization of the necessary spatial and logistical interfaces.
Benefits of our Project Delivery solutions to project delivery enterprises include:
•Distributed work-sharing. Our solutions incorporate the rigorous workflow protocols required for structured coordination across engineering and construction supply chains, enabling global sourcing for integrated project delivery, while maximizing economics, quality, and safety;
•Comprehensive collaboration. Our software leverages cloud and hybrid environments to streamline the aggregation, distribution, and interaction for project deliverables, ensuring that the right project participants have the right information in the right format at the right time, including at the project site and on every device; and
•Construction visibility. Our solutions’ broad span and continuous detail across design integration, construction modeling and work packaging, and mixed‑reality 4D visualization, advances predictability, accountability, and safety throughout the construction process.
Asset Lifecycle Solutions. Our Asset Lifecycle solutions span the operating life of commissioned infrastructure assets, capturing and managing changes to engineering models and enterprise information for compliance and safety, and to model performance and reliability to support operating and maintenance decisions.
Asset and Network Performance. Our Asset and Network Performance solutions are used to manage engineering information and geospatial relationships for operating and provisioning infrastructure across all sectors, including linear networks for transportation and energy transmission and distribution. Our asset performance modeling provides the needed analytical context for “right-time” data, including from Internet of Things (“IoT”) sensor capabilities, to yield actionable insights.
Benefits of our Asset and Network Performance Solutions for owner‑operators include:
•Better compliance and assurance. Our systems intrinsically enforce the rigor appropriate for operating infrastructure assets in order to provide dependable visibility into the impact of changes;
•Better asset performance. Our solutions include operational dashboards that provide decision support insights to maintain and improve throughput and reliability; and
•Better risk management. Our solutions include predictive analytics that identify potential problems before they occur, and ensure the accessibility of best‑available engineering information and models for mitigation and resilience.
Digital Cities. Our Digital Cities solutions incorporate reality modeling (leveraging drone and mobile mapping “survey” inputs) and geospatial context to continuously capture as‑operated infrastructure conditions at city and regional scale. Our offerings support department‑level applications for municipal engineering, such as simulation of pedestrian and vehicle traffic, and water and drainage systems.
Benefits of our Digital Cities solutions to cities, regions, and their constituents include:
•Evergreen 3D city models. Our reality modeling software maintains engineering‑ready 3D models, incorporating incrementally updated surveys, and thus ensures that engineering departments can rely on up‑to‑date geospatial context for digital workflows;
•Better resilience. Our solutions can integrate geotechnical, structural/seismic, and hydrological engineering modeling with evergreen 3D city models to harden infrastructure from flood and other natural hazards, and to apply engineering simulations for mitigation and emergency response; and
•Resource conservation. Taking full advantage of our solutions can significantly increase efficiency and reduce waste. For instance, our water network modeling tools, applied to compare as‑designed specifications to observed flows and pressures, can help to non‑invasively locate subsurface water network leaks.
Infrastructure Digital Twins.
Our digital twins offerings enable our users to create and curate cloud‑native 4D digital representations of physical projects and resulting assets, incorporating underlying engineering information, and then to model, simulate, analyze, chronicle, and predict performance over time. Using digital twins, our users can more fully extend digital workflows across project delivery and asset performance, increasing the value of infrastructure engineers’ work.
Benefits of our digital twins solutions to project delivery firms and owner‑operators include:
•Advanced insights. For project delivery, digital twins can reveal insights beyond what would be visible with traditional workflows; for example, a digital twin can show 3D heat maps highlighting where changes in a design have been unusually pervasive, indicating possible design flaws. For asset performance, such insights from digital twins can be used to evaluate different strategies for optimizing operational efficiencies and throughput;
•Predictive analytics. For project delivery, digital twins and machine learning can compare the progress of a current project with similar projects that have been previously completed, and identify in advance potential bottlenecks, in time to take corrective action. For asset performance, a digital twin can track observations from various operational inputs against design intelligence to predict future failures and recommend maintenance actions to minimize downtime;
•Continuous and comprehensive design reviews. For project delivery, digital twins can aggregate and align design models and data from all sources “on the fly” (without interruptions for translations, and without specialized software) to present immersive 3D status visualization in a web browser for any authorized stakeholder to participate in ongoing interactive design reviews; and
•Convergence of OT, IT, and now ET. Infrastructure owner‑operators are increasingly able to instrument their assets with IoT sensors, producing torrents of Operational Technology (“OT”) data that are difficult to interpret. Software advances in Information Technology (“IT”) can in turn make data from enterprise transaction systems, such as maintenance work order history, accessible for analytics. But even OT and IT together cannot inform decisions for improved asset performance as sufficiently as when combined with accessibility to comparable analytics from the assets’ engineering models, which we refer to as the Engineering Technology (“ET”). Infrastructure digital twins notably enable the convergence of ET with OT and IT. With infrastructure digital twins, the design intent (the “digital DNA” captured in the digital twins’ engineering models and simulations) can serve as a baseline for comparison to IoT-monitored “as‑operated” performance, in light of the asset’s operations and maintenance history stored in IT systems, to enable integrated analytics to provide timely insights and recommended actions to optimize safety and performance.
Comprehensiveness of Our Offerings
Our offerings are comprehensive across professional disciplines, lifecycle stages, infrastructure sectors, and geographies, resulting in what we believe to be durable competitive advantages:
Professional Disciplines. Each infrastructure project requires seamless and deep collaboration among professional disciplines, which can include civil, structural, geotechnical, and process engineers, architects, geospatial professionals, city and regional planners, contractors, fabricators, and operations and maintenance engineers. Our open modeling and open simulation applications facilitate iterative interactions between disciplines and coordination across project participants. Additionally, we believe our collaboration systems lead the market in managing infrastructure engineering firms’ preferred work-in-progress workflows.
For example, to illustrate the benefits of interdisciplinary digital workflows in roadway design, our offerings’ comprehensiveness can enhance both safety and economics by enriching the interfaces between geotechnical (earthworks) and structural analyses to share full 3D modeling details. Previously, structural decisions tended to be based on just a single imported parameter for subsurface foundation strength, frequently resulting in designs that included specifications and reinforcing materials beyond what was necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.
The importance of integrating our offerings broadly across disciplines is also a reason that we have always prioritized interoperability with competitors’ design tools. For major projects, owners and their contractors want to have the choice of the best professionals in every discipline, rather than limiting their choices to those using a particular software vendors’ applications. Our offerings win acceptance within major organizations and projects both through our breadth of applications, and through each application’s virtuosity in interpreting and emulating formats beyond our own.
Lifecycle Stages. Both project delivery enterprises and owner‑operators benefit from our solutions, which enable digital workflows to extend between project and asset lifecycles, from design to construction and ultimately asset management. This capability allows our users’ digital engineering models to be leveraged as the context for real-time condition monitoring to achieve better and safer operations and maintenance.
For an example of advantageous digital workflows from projects to assets, consider our solutions for permitting and routing of over‑weight and over‑sized loads by departments of transportation. Instead of routing based merely on static maximum load ratings for each bridge, we use actual bridge design models for dynamic structural simulations, and 3D clearances of the actual load configurations. As a result, user organizations are able to engineer safe routes to maximize commerce while protecting bridge longevity.
Infrastructure Sectors. Most major engineering and project delivery firms pursue an ever‑changing mix of projects across the public works/utilities, industrial/resources, and commercial/facilities sectors and for flexibility tend to favor an infrastructure engineering software vendor whose portfolio correspondingly spans their full breadth. This comprehensiveness provides diversification for our own business, as an incidental advantage. For example, when there have been cyclical downturns in the primarily privately‑financed industrial/resources and commercial/facilities sectors, we have historically witnessed offsetting counter‑cyclical government investment in public works/utilities.
Geographies. While design codes may vary by country, infrastructure purposes and engineering practices are fundamentally the same throughout the world, which makes it possible for our infrastructure modeling applications to be used globally. Our offerings are available in most major languages, supporting country‑specific standards and conventions. Our development teams are also globally dispersed, due in part to acquisitions made in various countries, but also to provide any needed last mile localization of our applications. Our global comprehensiveness enables our project delivery accounts to compete more efficiently across geographic markets, thus also providing global supply‑chain sourcing choices for owners.
The Digital Twins Opportunity
We believe that digital progress in infrastructure advancement has to date lagged behind other economic domains for several reasons, including that:
•most existing infrastructure assets predate engineering modeling software;
•engineers’ work, including by way of building information modeling (“BIM”) or geographic information systems (“GIS”), has been sequestered in native file formats that amount to “dark data,” inaccessible without the software that was used to create it, and therefore unavailable for use in digital workflows or analytics; and
•construction processes are often fragmented and isolated from digital workflows altogether, resulting in engineering information being effectively abandoned between the project and the asset lifecycle phases of infrastructure.
Over our company’s history, as computing capabilities have advanced, the scope of infrastructure engineering software has correspondingly increased. However, project lifecycle and asset lifecycle software markets have developed independently from one another and connecting digital workflows have not been offered. We believe that the new advancement of BIM and GIS to “evergreen” infrastructure digital twins will have the effect of merging what have to date been separate market spaces.

Period | Project Lifecycle Software | Asset Lifecycle Software 
1985 – 1995 | 2D Drafting (“Computer Aided Design,” or “CAD”): Workstations and then personal computers make possible interactive graphical applications to automate the creation of previously manually drafted 2D engineering drawings. | 2D Mapping: Workstations and personal computers make possible interactive graphical applications to automate the creation of maps. 
1996 – 2005 | Collaboration: Networked personal computers and servers provide platforms for file-sharing and referencing. CDEs are introduced. | GIS: Networked personal computers and servers enable querying and visualization of geographic data. 
2006 – 2015 | 3D BIM: Increased personal computing power enables the development of 3D applications for design of specific asset types including buildings, process plants, roads, water networks, and buildings. CDEs and the internet lead to global work-sharing and collaborative BIM. | Geospatial: Increased computing address space enables geo-coordinated engineering models. GPS technology enables alignment of digital components and real-world coordinates.Asset Performance Management (“APM”): solutions are introduced for reliability-centered maintenance and risk-based inspection.
2015 – 2018 | Reality Modeling: Advances in digital imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs” or “drones”), and specialized software enable the automated capture of as-operated conditions of an asset or site in an engineering-ready, geo-coordinated 3D model. Cloud ubiquity enables Common Data Environments to evolve into Connected Data Environments. | APM evolves into Asset Performance Modeling, with engineering models recalibrated to reproduce and understand observed behaviors, and apply algorithms and analytics to derive insights and drive decisions. 


Period | Project Lifecycle Software | Asset Lifecycle Software
2019 – Present | 4D Digital Twins: Digital twins make possible the simulation of the behavior and the visualization of the changes of a project or infrastructure asset over time. Digital twins are continually updated in a cloud database and remain current and “evergreen,” over the full project and asset lifecycle, through continuous surveying of the physical context and embedded links to inputs from connected IoT sensors in the operating asset. With digital twins, users are empowered to better understand the impact of changes over time for projects and assets to improve project, construction, and operational efficiencies, predictability, and overall outcomes.

To enable infrastructure engineering to catch up and advance in “going digital,” we have enabled infrastructure digital twins, cloud‑provisioned digital representations of projects and assets that incorporate and converge their 3D physical conditions (“digital context”) for reality, their underlying engineering information (“digital components”) for veracity, and their 4D timeline of changes (“digital chronology”) for fidelity, enabling the merging of project lifecycle and asset lifecycle workflows.
Digital twins solutions are now made possible by new technologies including UAVs and their intrinsic “surveying” sensors, machine learning, cloud computing, open‑source development libraries, distributed ledger software, and mixed‑reality visualization.
Our software to leverage these advancements for our digital twins offerings includes:
•Reality modeling software, which processes any combination of overlapping digital photography, video, and scanned imagery to produce a 3D model. Our software then uses machine learning to recognize and classify components within the 3D model (such as equipment, structural elements, pipes, valves, tags, and nameplates). This process populates the digital twins’ digital context with digital components that add intelligence, especially when aligned with engineering models from the design stage;
•iModel distributed databases, which combine and align the digital components from all available sources for infrastructure projects and/or assets. iModels are created and bridged to our iTwins cloud services from our own engineering applications or from third‑party applications. Using our iModel distributed databases, “dark data” is opened and aligned semantically and spatially with all other relevant models, allowing this information to be accessed and for its value to be enhanced; and
•iTwins cloud services, which update distributed databases through change ledgers to synchronize digital twins, as required, with physical and engineering changes. Along with assuring that their fidelity can be relied upon for critical decisions, our iTwins cloud services maintain secure environments for infrastructure digital twins’ visualization and analytics visibility. Our iTwin services can be added to any user’s or accounts’ environments to generate incremental value by incorporating infrastructure engineering data within cloud-native evergreen digital twins. The go‑to‑market strategy for our iTwin cloud services is based on a dual-pronged sales strategy:
•Sales to enterprise accounts using ProjectWise and AssetWise, to more broadly propagate their project and asset engineering data, respectively, through iTwins Design Review Service for comprehensive project‑wide 4D status visibility, Immersive Asset Services, and PlantSight; and
•Sales to individual practitioners and their workgroups for ad-hoc iTwins Design Review Service, often to upgrade their use of 2D PDF tools to 3D.
We believe that the growing adoption of infrastructure digital twins will serve to overcome the factors that have held back the digital advancement of infrastructure engineering. Moreover, we believe that due to the comprehensiveness of our solutions across project and asset lifecycles, infrastructure digital twins and newly enabled digital workflows spanning design, construction, and operations, will most particularly benefit our users and enhance our competitiveness.
Our Growth Strategies
We employ the following growth strategies to address the infrastructure engineering software market opportunities:
•Accretion within existing accounts. Most of our accounts currently use a small portion of our overall portfolio, even though they are often working on projects and assets where a large portion of our portfolio could be applied. We believe we can further penetrate our existing accounts by broadening their use of our portfolio. There are three primary mechanisms for this expansion:
•New commercial formulations. We continually innovate with new commercial formulations to align the use of our software to the needs of our users. Presently, we offer our subscription solutions by the day, month, quarter, and year. Additionally, we offer options enabling unrestricted access to our comprehensive software portfolio. We believe the flexibility in our commercial models and deployment options will allow our accounts to grow usage continuously;
•Automating user engagement. We employ various technologies to drive user engagement. These technologies help to automate the user experience and drive engagement by suggesting and recommending best practices and appropriate software upgrades. We will continue to leverage these interactive technologies to virtually assist our users and drive engagement across our software offerings; and
•Adding new offerings. We have a history of building and maintaining leadership in infrastructure software engineering comprehensiveness and intend to continue to innovate and develop our software offerings. Selected recent examples of our product innovations include the 2019 introduction of new multi‑disciplinary modeling and simulation applications for 5G‑ready communications towers and for offshore wind turbines, and the 2019 integration of our acquisitions of new software for vehicle traffic simulation and mobile mapping. Over the near term, we believe our iTwins Cloud Services represent a compelling opportunity to enhance value for our accounts. We intend to continue to develop and integrate new products and capabilities over time.
•Focusing on Asia. We believe Asia represents a large market opportunity and will continue to do so over the foreseeable future. According to the Oxford Economics Outlook, a majority of expected infrastructure spending for the period between 2016 and 2040 is expected to occur in Asia. Additionally, we believe that in Asia there is an abundance of skilled engineers whose work can be virtually exported, as well as engineering organizations that are eager and aggressive to win mandates for engineering and construction projects around the world. We intend to continue investing in strategies to enhance our market position in Asia.
•Increasing inside sales. Historically, our account management resources have focused on larger firms. Smaller and medium‑sized engineering firms, however, represent a significant market opportunity and have the same needs for our comprehensive portfolio as the larger firms. While these firms have generally been served by our competitors’ channel partners, we believe they will prefer to deal directly with us. We will continue to expand our global inside sales resources and to multiply their reach and effectiveness with superior digital tools to convert leads and to provide the self‑service administration that engineering practitioners prefer.
•Digital co-ventures. We have forged substantial alliances with other major participants in the infrastructure engineering supply chain, primarily to jointly develop and offer digital twin cloud services that extend the scope of our software. These alliances include:
•Siemens AG (“Siemens”): Our partnership integrates leading industrial software and IoT capabilities for a broad joint development program focused on improving outcomes during infrastructure operations and maintenance through digital workflows enabled by digital twins cloud services; and
•Microsoft: Our partnership extends Azure‑powered machine learning and analytics through digital workflows for infrastructure professionals and enterprises.
•Investing in digital integrator businesses. We intend to pursue strategic investments to enhance and grow our core software business with the objective of cultivating an ecosystem of relatively service‑intensive, digital integrator businesses that stimulate pull‑through demand for our solutions. These investments may take the form of acquisitions, wholly owned start‑up initiatives, minority equity stakes, alliances, or loans. Certain of our recent digital integrator activities include:
•Digital Construction Works, Inc. (“DCW”): Our partnership with Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. (“Topcon”) integrates leading surveying technologies and geospatial machine control technologies for digital workflows between engineering and usage in the field. Our companies’ DCW joint venture provides expert services to major project delivery enterprises to incorporate these constructioneering workflows.
•The Cohesive Companies: These investments, spawned by our acquisition of Cohesive Solutions in 2020, focus on enterprise asset management, asset performance, and digital twin integration services.
•Digital Water Works: This wholly‑owned start‑up initiative focuses on the implementation, integration, and adoption services necessary to establish digital twin solutions for water and waste water utilities.
•iTwins Ventures: This $100 million corporate venture capital fund was announced to invest in promising technology companies addressing the emerging opportunity for infrastructure digital twin solutions strategically relevant to our business.
The forgoing investments in digital integrator businesses may have lower margins than the majority of our software business activities due to the services nature of digital integrator revenues or due to the early stage nature of the investments.

Our Commercial Offerings
Licensing Models
Our applications are offered through perpetual licenses or term licenses, priced dependent on the country of purchase and use. Most accounts owning perpetual licenses subscribe to our SELECT coverage which, in addition to providing support and upgrades, enables the use of their licenses for each product to be pooled within each country. For most larger accounts (generally a minimum of $250,000 annualized recurring revenues), we have traditionally offered an enterprise license subscription (“ELS”), which entitles unlimited use of any of our applications for an annual fixed fee, reset annually generally based on actual usage (within each country) for the previous year. During the fourth quarter of 2018, to respond to and improve upon new commercial models offered by peers and competitors, we introduced a new global consumption‑based plan with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, enterprise 365 (“E365”) subscription, which is priced uniformly per application per day of actual usage in any country, and inclusive of Success services (described below) by our colleagues to assist with expanding and gaining the most value from usage of our software. We have begun upgrading ELS accounts to E365, beginning with the largest global accounts.
Our systems, ProjectWise and AssetWise, are offered under our cloud services subscription (“CSS”) program, charged quarterly based on actual users of “passports” and “visas” for various levels of functionality. Passport and visa pricing include Azure provisioning at our cost, although some accounts elect to continue on‑premises and/or hybrid hosting. CSS commercial models entail an annual funding commitment, generally paid upfront, based on an estimation of services to be used for the upcoming year. Actual consumption is monitored and invoiced against the deposit on a calendar quarter basis. Accounts are charged only for what gets used, and deposited amounts never expire. At the end of 2020, accounts comprising approximately 65% of our total ARR had chosen to institute our new commercial models of CSS and/or E365 consumption funding for licensing of our software.
Success Plans
Over the past several years we have re‑deployed the post‑sale focus of our success force, comprising approximately 1,000 colleagues with experience and credentials in infrastructure engineering, from on‑demand professional services and training to instead fulfill “Success Plans.” Through Success Plans we assume proactive responsibilities to accounts to maximize their value from our solutions, which we accomplish by assigning our success force experts to be dedicated to serve multiple accounts requiring similar specializations. Typically, our success force engages with our accounts remotely. Success Plans are bundled into our new E365 commercial program and are growing rapidly among our major accounts.
Our success force also provides:
•Managed services, under Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”), to administer accounts’ instances of our Azure‑provisioned ProjectWise and/or AssetWise systems. SLAs vary as to our scope of responsibility, sometimes including Success Plans and/or our colleagues dedicated onsite;
•Professional services, mainly for implementation and integration of our ProjectWise and AssetWise systems within substantial enterprises, although we seek to minimize the need for this; and
•Digital Advancement Academies, where we convene industry participants to share best practices, including in programs with major owner‑operator accounts to onboard their supply chains for initiatives in going digital.
Our Accounts
We provide our software solutions to over 34,000 accounts in 172 countries worldwide. Our revenues are balanced and diversified between engineering and construction contracting firms who work together to deliver the design and construction of capital projects (representing 57%, 55%, and 54% of our 2020, 2019, and 2018 revenues, respectively), and their clients, the world’s public and private infrastructure asset owners and operators (representing 43%, 45%, and 46% of our 2020, 2019, and 2018 revenues, respectively).
We do not have material account concentration. No account, including any group of accounts under common control or accounts that are affiliates of each other, represented more than 2.5% of our revenues in 2020, 2019, or 2018.
Our Technology
Our business is singularly focused on software for infrastructure engineering, primarily for the world’s largest projects and assets. As a result, we manage our software products to meet constraints imposed for fitness to this purpose. Our market position is built on several reputational hallmarks, including:
•generational stability of file formats, corresponding to the long lives of infrastructure projects and assets;
•commitment to openness and interoperability with competitors’ file formats;
•continuity of software applications’ lifecycles, never jeopardizing users’ cumulative investments by requiring them to “start over”; and
•highest capacity and performance, versus competitors, for large infrastructure models and datasets.
Application Framework
Our software solutions are delivered using flexible, reusable, and open technology, which results in highly integrated applications and cloud services that support comprehensive digital workflows in a scalable manner. For example, our modeling and simulation applications, including MicroStation, leverage a set of reusable components for graphics editing, visualization, solid modeling, and other capabilities. This open framework supports the addition of domain specific features, allowing us to offer highly compatible and well-integrated discipline‑specific applications based on this common framework.
Microsoft Integration
Our software leverages Microsoft’s platform technologies. We seek to take full advantage of integration with Microsoft Office 365 and other horizontal applications such as Teams for workflows that unify our engineering applications within enterprise environments across all computing form factors and devices.
iModels and iModelHub
We support a rich format for digital twins called an iModel, a relational database encapsulated in a file, that stores aligned domain data from multiple source applications. iModels are synchronized with our design applications and we provide software development tools to enable iModels to be synchronized with third-party applications or services. We have created and maintain iModel connections to most of the significant applications used in infrastructure engineering. iModels provide a common data currency to support open and easy exchange between users and systems, and we believe that they have become a de facto standard for visibility and collaboration of digital engineering models. iModelHub, an iTwin cloud service, manages each iModel as a distributed database with an intrinsic ledger of changes (enabling alignment, accountability, and accessibility of digital components over the lifecycle of a project or an asset) to form the backbone of an infrastructure digital twin. To foster an expanded ecosystem of digital twin innovation, our iModel.js code is available on GitHub as an open source library under the MIT license.
Our Licensing and Administration Platform
All of our applications and systems share a cloud‑native platform for license pooling, management of subscription entitlements, and usage reporting for us and for accounts, including for commercial consumption metrics. Our platform also logs usage of particular “instrumented” functions within our applications to enable our success force to be of most value. Our platform can also provide in-application messaging to users from our success force.
Our Acquisitions
Since our founding, we have purposefully pursued a strategy of regularly acquiring and integrating specialized infrastructure engineering software businesses, including 21 acquisitions over the past five years. Our average historical annual revenue growth rate from acquisitions over the last five years has been approximately 1.7%. Our acquisitions have the following purposes:
•filling in the breadth and depth of our comprehensive applications portfolio across disciplines and infrastructure sectors, especially where the developer organizations have already worked on integration and compatibility with our platforms and Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”);
•extending our lifecycle comprehensiveness, especially for our Asset and Network Performance and Digital Cities product advancement units;
•adding new horizontal technologies that we can incorporate within our platforms for the benefit of our applications and systems at large, such as reality modeling; and
•adding new distribution capacity, such as to channel partners in geographies where we wish to accelerate our scale and growth.
Our executive management and our Portfolio Development team proactively identify and develop potential acquisition subject areas and unsolicited candidates. We also are prepared, experienced, and able to respond with agility when appropriate situations may appear opportunistically. We have a disciplined and proprietary diligence and valuation process for evaluating acquisition targets. Our general practice is to fully assimilate the acquired companies’ functions into our global functional structure as quickly as possible, supported by a dedicated team to manage and streamline the integration process.
We prioritize the retention and development of the acquired incoming colleagues from our acquisitions, including offering talent mobility for key personnel. Further, many of our current line executives are former founders and/or C‑level officers of companies we have acquired.
Examples of key recent acquisitions, along with their purposes, include:
•PLAXIS (2018), SoilVision (2018), and Keynetix (2019), to become what we believe be a world leader in geotechnical engineering modeling and simulation software and in geotechnical information management;
•SYNCHRO (2018), to become a leading provider of 4D construction modeling software;
•ACE Enterprise (2018), to integrate our systems with enterprise environments such as SAP and IBM’s Maximo;
•Citilabs (2019), to add vehicle traffic simulation software (CUBE) and roadway movement data (Streetlytics) to lead to improved mobility digital twins for Digital Cities;
•OrbitGT (2019), to add specialized capabilities for mobile mapping (such as vehicle‑based scanning and photogrammetry) to our reality modeling offerings for Digital Cities;
•GroupBC (2020), to bring additional common data environment solutions for construction projects and infrastructure assets, and federate to iTwin cloud services, extending the value of project and asset information through digital twins; and
•Cohesive Solutions (2020), to bring digital integrator expertise for the convergence, through digital twin cloud services, of digital engineering models (ET), with IT and OT, for infrastructure assets in the utilities, energy, and facilities sectors.
Our Competition
The market for our software solutions is highly competitive and subject to change. We compete against large, global, publicly‑traded companies that have resources greater than our own, and also against small, new, or geographically‑focused firms that specialize in developing niche software offerings. While we do not believe that any competitor offers a portfolio as comprehensive as ours, we do face strong competition, varying by infrastructure lifecycle phase and sector:
•our key competitors in public works/utilities applications include Autodesk, Inc., Trimble Inc., Hexagon AB, and Dassault Systèmes;
•our key competitors in industrial/resources applications include Hexagon AB and AVEVA Group plc;
•our key competitors in commercial/facilities applications include Autodesk, Inc., Nemetschek SE, and Trimble Inc.;
•our key competitors in project lifecycle systems include Autodesk, Inc. and Oracle Corporation with their Primavera P6 and Aconex offerings; and
•our key competitors in asset lifecycle systems include Aspen Technology, Inc., AVEVA Group plc, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., and General Electric Corp.
The principal competitive factors affecting our market include:
•product features, performance, and effectiveness;
•reliability and security;
•product line breadth, depth, and continuity;
•comprehensiveness of offerings across disciplines and infrastructure sectors;
•specification by and endorsement of infrastructure owners, and degree of adoption across the relevant supply chain;
•familiarity and loyalty by professionals throughout their training and careers;
•ability to integrate with other technology;
•capacity to operate at scale;
•capabilities for configurability and APIs;
•ease of use and efficient workflows;
•price, commercial model, and total cost of use;
•support of industry standards;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe we compete favorably against our competitors based on the factors above and that we distinguish ourselves through our comprehensive software portfolio, our commitment to both integration and interoperability across the entire infrastructure lifecycle, our flexible commercial models, and our direct sales channels.
Our Sales and Marketing
We bring our offerings to market primarily through direct sales channels that generated approximately 92% of our 2020 revenues. Our direct sales channel includes:
•Corporate Account Managers, who are responsible for our largest accounts;
•Inside Sales Specialists, who are responsible for servicing small‑ to mid‑sized (“commercial”) accounts in territories defined by geography and product lines; and
•Product Sales Specialists, who are technical experts in a specific product line who work with Corporate Account Managers and Inside Sales Specialists.
We rely on specialist channel partners in geographic regions where we do not currently have a meaningful presence and where, for many of our offerings, direct sales efforts are less economically feasible. Channel partners accounted for approximately 8% of 2020 revenue. We are establishing digital integrators such as DCW to serve as global channel partners. In addition, we have established a new business endeavor, DXW+, which offers practitioner subscriptions that include virtual support and advice from DXW’s engineering experts. DXW+ is available in selected and expanding geographies, and for individual professionals in any organization. We also benefit from additional sales resources and coverage from our digital co‑venturers through various forms, including bundles of our offerings with theirs.
Sales cycles for our applications tend to be relatively short, measured in weeks. The most prevalent transactions are increases by accounts in their use of our applications already in use. Our sales model allows and encourages accounts to try usage of our applications that are new to them with minimal obligation. We act upon our logs of such new usage to assign user success colleagues to help the new users in this expanded adoption.
Our system offerings, ProjectWise and AssetWise, are generally sold through either proactive proposals or responses to RFPs, so sales cycles for those offerings range from months to several quarters. We have a comprehensive global proposals team to assure appropriate business development resources are allocated, to quality‑assure efficient and effective proposal contents, and to maximize the capture ratio for our proposal pursuit.
Our marketing functions include:
•corporate marketing, to build brand awareness, brand equity, and thought leadership, including through corporate events and programs covering industry trends and challenges, and to conduct market research and industry studies;
•industry and product marketing, for demand generation through digital marketing channels, including our website, Internet advertising, webinars, and virtual events, and paid and organic social media, and through traditional marketing channels such as trade print advertising, press releases, editorial placements, industry‑specific trade shows and conferences, in‑person seminars, and locally‑sponsored events; and
•regional marketing, to localize and deliver our marketing programs throughout the world.
We also invest in our annual Year in Infrastructure Conference, which brings together leading infrastructure thought leaders from around the world for presentations on innovative projects, to learn about the latest advances to our applications and cloud offerings, and to network and share best practices. Our associated Year in Infrastructure Going Digital Awards, which we held virtually in 2020 due to the COVID‑19 pandemic, attracted over 400 project nominations from our accounts and are judged by independent juries in 19 categories for digital advancements in infrastructure engineering.
Our Research and Development
We continue to make substantial investments in research and development because we believe the infrastructure engineering software market presents compelling opportunities for the application of new technologies that advance our current solutions. Our research and development roadmap balances technology advances and new offerings with continuous enhancements to existing offerings. Our allocation of research and development resources is guided by management‑established priorities, input from product managers, and user and sales force feedback.
We had more than 1,400 colleagues engaged globally in software research and development as of December 31, 2020. Each of our product advancement groups for Design Integration, Project Delivery, Asset and Network Performance, and Digital Cities have research and development resources and responsibilities. Our iTwin Services group consists of over 250 colleagues and is entirely devoted to the rapid development of new and incremental cloud‑native services for infrastructure digital twins. Our separate Chief Technology Office assesses the potential of new software technologies and sources.
As part of our resource allocation process, we also conduct a cost‑benefit analysis of acquiring available technology in the marketplace versus developing our own solutions. Our Portfolio Development office, in addition to pursuing appropriate acquisitions and digital-integrator startups, allocates funding for internal “acceleration” projects, to “make” rather than “buy.” Each such project is staffed with colleagues dedicated to the “intrapreneurial” incubation of a new offering, which is brought back to its respective sponsoring product advancement group after market introduction.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our research and development spending was $185.5 million, $183.6 million, and $175.0 million, respectively, and as a percentage of total revenues was 23.1%, 24.9%, and 25.3%, respectively.
Digital co-ventures
In 2019, we and Topcon created an equally‑owned joint venture, DCW, to serve as a digital integrator for major construction projects and related enterprises. We and Topcon each contributed experienced colleagues in addition to the required capital commitments.
As part of our co‑venturing with Siemens, we undertake a program of joint research and development investment in which each company bears its own costs. These investments have led to jointly offered cloud services for infrastructure digital twins, some of which are already commercially available. We and Siemens have committed to a cumulative investment of over €100 million to fund the joint innovation investment program.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe that the success of our business depends more on the quality of our proprietary software solutions, technology, processes, and domain expertise than on copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. While we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable, we do not believe that our competitive position depends primarily on obtaining legal protection for our software solutions and technology. Instead, we believe that our competitive position depends primarily on our ability to maintain a leadership position by developing innovative proprietary software solutions, technology, information, processes, and know‑how. Nevertheless, we rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets in the United States and other jurisdictions to secure our intellectual property, and we use contractual provisions and non‑disclosure agreements to protect it. As of December 31, 2020, we had 115 patents granted and 54 patents pending in the United States, the first of which expires on September 21, 2021, and 22 patents granted and 43 patents pending internationally, the first of which expires on August 14, 2022. In addition, from time to time we enter into collaboration arrangements and in‑bound licensing agreements with third parties, including certain of our competitors, in order to expand the functionality and interoperability of our software solutions. We are not substantially dependent upon any one of these arrangements, and we are not obligated to pay any material royalty or license fees with respect to them.
Our patents cover systems and methods relating to various aspects of software for infrastructure design and modeling, collaboration and work sharing, and infrastructure asset operations. Among other things, our patents address a broad range of issues in infrastructure domains from analyzing building energy usage and structural analysis, railway system maintenance, water network design and operation and augmented reality, as well as techniques for creating, storing, displaying, and processing infrastructure models.
To innovate and increase our strategic position, our software developers are incentivized to alert our internal patent committee to innovations that might be patentable or of strategic value. In 2020, our patent committee reviewed 16 invention disclosures submitted by our software developers, and filed 17 U.S. and 11 foreign patent applications, while five U.S. and one foreign patents were granted. We also plan to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for aspects of our technology and solutions that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. We have registered 150 trademarks, including “Bentley,” “MicroStation,” “AssetWise,” and “ProjectWise,” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the United States.

Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K may appear without the ®, TM, or SM symbols, but the lack of those references is not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks, trade names, and service marks. We do not intend our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, trade names, or service marks to imply, and such use or display should not be construed to imply, endorsement or sponsorship of us by these other parties.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”)
Our mission is to leverage our leading software and services to drive impact through the world’s infrastructure – advancing both the global economy and the environment for improved quality of life. Our mission is rooted in the philosophy of corporate responsibility and ESG. As we scale, we are committed to continually improving our ESG profile. By nature, our products and services provide immense ESG opportunities through resource efficiency, optimization, safety, and mitigation of environmental harm in global infrastructure development. Our commitment is not only inherent to our product offerings, but integral to our business success, as our products and services are directly connected to the well‑being of the communities and environments where we work. 
As we enter the public markets, we are working to formalize our approach to ESG to ensure that all stakeholder needs and material ESG topics have appropriate strategies and governance in place. In working with an outside consultant, we are developing a formal framework for ESG that we will report on in the future. We look forward to enhancing our disclosures for ESG and welcome engagement from all interested stakeholders as we continue to make progress on this critical initiative.
Human Capital Management
Our global talent management is essential to attract and retain top talent, remain competitive, and ensure business success and continued growth. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,104 full‑time colleagues globally, including 1,566 in the Americas (the U.S., Canada, and Latin America (including the Caribbean)), 1,247 in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and 1,291 in Asia‑Pacific (“APAC”). Presently, none of our full‑time U.S. colleagues are unionized. Outside the U.S., a small overall portion of our colleagues in certain countries are represented by a colleague representative organization, such as a union or colleague association. Our colleagues bring 65 languages to fulfill the needs of our globally dispersed accounts and users. Our colleagues are highly qualified with an average of seven years of total service with the Company and advanced academic credentials, including 91 doctoral degrees and 1,002 master’s‑level degrees.
We believe our culture and values are a key driver for attracting, developing, and retaining highly talented colleagues. Our culture and values are rooted in the philosophy of corporate responsibility and ESG, which drive workforce motivation to make an impact on the world’s infrastructure and improve quality of life, a passion to solve our users’ challenging problems through innovation and creativity, a desire to connect and collaborate, and a commitment to deliver on our promises.
Our approach to talent management is guided by our strong sense of corporate culture. We do this by striving to remain competitive with our peers and to embed opportunity, engagement, diversity, inclusion, and continuous growth throughout the entire lifecycle of talent management.
