ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated in August 2020 as a Delaware corporation whose primary business purpose is to effect a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. We have not selected any potential business combination target and we have not generated any operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
We intend to continue to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify and acquire a business. In particular, we continue to intend to target early stage North American or European companies in the biotechnology sector of the healthcare industry where our management has extensive investment and operational experience. We may also pursue a transaction in which our stockholders immediately prior to the completion of our initial business combination would collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company.
Our Founders
Our sponsor is an affiliate of 5AM Venture Management, LLC, or 5AM, a leading venture capital firm focused on building next-generation life science companies solving important healthcare needs with cutting-edge breakthroughs in medicine and science. Founded in 2002, 5AM has invested over $1.4 billion in 96 companies across biotechnology, drug delivery technology and other life sciences sectors of the healthcare industry, with 52 active investments in its portfolio. We believe that 5AM’s track record of investing in early stage companies that subsequently are acquired or complete initial public offerings, or IPOs, at a preclinical or early clinical stage indicates that early stage investing is a “sweet spot” for 5AM. 5AM’s portfolio companies aim to spearhead novel approaches to prevent and treat a wide range of medical conditions. As of the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, had approved, cleared or authorized 21 products that were developed by 5AM portfolio companies, and 5AM’s portfolio companies have enrolled over 80,000 patients in more than 60 clinical trials.
As of January 27, 2022, 5AM’s 24 in-house investment professionals, venture partners and advisors possess strong scientific, medical, operational, legal and finance expertise. The 5AM team combines the talents of established venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, operating executives and leading scientists. Outside of their engagement with 5AM, 5AM’s team members have served as senior executives, chairpersons, board members, employees and/or advisors at life science companies such as Affymax, Affymetrix, Akcea Therapeutics, Amgen, Blueprint Medicines, Bristol Myers Squibb, Catalytica Pharmaceuticals, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, CV Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Ingenuity Systems, LJL BioSystems, Merck & Co., Moderna Therapeutics, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Nycomed Salutar, PTC Therapeutics, Relay Therapeutics, Sage Therapeutics, Sanofi Genzyme, Stemcentrx and uniQure. Most 5AM team members have forged long working relationships together and their mutual respect and cohesiveness is vital to 5AM’s long-term performance.
The 5AM team has compiled a long-term record as operating executives, scientists, and investment professionals in the life science industry and has invested in several successful, innovative and valuable life science companies. Since its inception in 2002 through the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, 5AM has delivered strong performance across its funds through investments in 96 private companies across biotechnology, drug delivery technology and other life sciences sectors, of which 20 companies have been acquired and 21 companies have successfully completed their IPOs. Of the 21 companies that have successfully completed their IPOs, 5AM Ventures team members hold or have held Chairman or director roles in 18 of these companies after going public. Recent representative investments include: Akouos (Nasdaq: AKUS), Aprea Therapeutics (Nasdaq: APRE), Artiva Biotherapeutics, Arvinas (Nasdaq: ARVN), Audentes Therapeutics (Nasdaq: BOLD, prior to acquisition by Astellas Pharma for approximately $3.0 billion), BlueLight Therapeutics, Cabaletta Bio (Nasdaq: CABA), Cidara Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CDTX), Cleave Therapeutics, CinCor Pharma (Nasdaq: CINC), Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: CRNX), EnLiven Therapeutics, Entrada Therapeutics, Escient Pharmaceuticals, Expansion Therapeutics, Faraday Pharmaceuticals, Homology Medicines (Nasdaq: FIXX), Ideaya Biosciences (Nasdaq: IDYA), Impel NeuroPharma (Nasdaq: IMPL), Kinaset Therapeutics, Neurogastrx, Nido Biosciences, NodThera, Nouscom, Novome, Novira Therapeutics (which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson for an undisclosed sum), Pearl Therapeutics (which was acquired by AstraZeneca for up to $1.15 billion), Pear Therapeutics (Nasdaq: PEAR), RallyBio (Nasdaq: RLYB), Relypsa (Nasdaq: RLYP, prior to acquisition by Galenica for approximately $1.5 billion), scPharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SCPH) and Vor Biopharma (Nasdaq: VOR).

Our Management Team
Members of our management team have spent most of their careers investing in the life science industry and have worked together over many years to help create stockholder value for 5AM’s portfolio companies. We believe that our management team is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing set of acquisition and investment opportunities within the biotechnology sector. Our management team (including our board members) have extensive experience in the sector as executives and directors for both publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. We believe our management team’s and directors’ experience with acquisitions, divestitures, corporate strategy and implementation will significantly benefit us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates. See Item 10 “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for more information regarding our management team.
The past performance of the members of our management team, 5AM or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management, 5AM or any of their respective affiliates’ or managed funds’ performance as indicative of our future performance.
Competitive Advantages
We believe that our management team is well-positioned within the biotechnology sector to identify potential opportunities for the reasons outlined below:

● | Track Record of Success: Members of our management team have established long-term track records as operating executives, scientists, and investment professionals in the biotechnology industry and have invested in several successful, innovative and valuable biotechnology companies. Since its inception in 2002 through the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, 5AM has delivered strong performance across its funds through investments in 96 private companies across biotechnology, drug delivery technology and other life sciences sectors, of which 20 companies been acquired and 21 companies have successfully completed their IPOs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive Transaction Sourcing: We believe our management team has access to high-quality deal flow, due in large part to their broad range of industry contacts, 5AM’s high profile in the biotechnology venture community and 5AM’s entrepreneurial scientific advisors. We place great emphasis on building and maintaining relationships throughout the global biotechnology industry (with executives, entrepreneurs, researchers, academics, venture capitalists, attorneys and bankers), which we believe will potentially give us access to attractive deal flow for a potential initial business combination. We expect our management team’s reputation at 5AM for having a well-defined focus and deep industry expertise will also attract referrals from industry colleagues. 5AM’s team sources, reviews and builds relationships with hundreds of early stage private investments every year. Many of these companies may not be known to late stage or public investors, and thus we believe our management team is in a strong position to identify attractive early stage investment and acquisition opportunities due to our relationship with 5AM.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Driving Value Creation Through Hands-on Involvement: 5AM and our management team have a history of working closely with portfolio companies as “operator friendly” company builders. The in-house 5AM team assists its portfolio company management teams by providing business, scientific, financial, intellectual property, recruiting and deal-making advice and often takes a hands-on approach to help devise strategic plans and drive stockholder value. We believe that input into operating plans, strategy and portfolio company management team development has a major impact on creating and realizing stockholder value. We believe that our management team’s blend of operating and investment experience will help us identify transformational technologies and subsequently assist companies in maximizing their potential value. Further, 5AM’s and our management team’s experience in building teams and shaping strategy provides us with deep experience in pursuing early stage acquisition targets, with potentially broad platform technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad Experience Across Private and Public Markets: 5AM has an established track record investing out of its seven early stage life sciences venture capital funds as well as two funds targeting investments in later stage private and public companies, called 5AM Opportunities I and 5AM Opportunities II. As of December 31, 2021, portfolio consisted of 17 public companies with a total value of $529 million based on the closing stock price as on December 31, 2021. Over the past five years, thirteen 5AM portfolio companies have completed IPOs During their time at 5AM, current 5AM team members have served as directors on the board for 18 biotechnology companies that successfully completed IPOs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2




● | Deep Relationships Across the Biotechnology Ecosystem: 5AM maintains extensive relationships with senior business development and R&D leadership across the biotechnology ecosystem, which we believe provides important access to high quality deal flow, top level talent, and significant insights into industry trends. Further, we believe that these relationships are attractive for potential portfolio companies because they may provide portfolio companies access to direct communication with senior leadership throughout the industry, allowing 5AM’s portfolio companies to explore potential strategic opportunities and exits. Companies affiliated with 5AM access the firm’s network of senior leadership through regular events including 5AM’s Portfolio Day attended by heads of business development from many major pharmaceutical companies, and the rEVOLUTION Symposium attended by senior R&D leadership of several biotechnology companies. Multiple 5AM portfolio therapeutics companies have been acquired by strategic purchasers, including by Amgen, Astellas Pharma, AstraZeneca, Biotie, EntreMed, Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, Roche, Takeda Pharmaceutical, The Medicines Company, Vifor Pharma, and WuXi AppTec.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Strategy
We believe that our management team is well-positioned to identify attractive acquisition opportunities as a result of our reputation, experience and track record of successful investments. Our acquisition strategy is to identify an attractive opportunity within our target industry that offers attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders.
As an affiliate of 5AM, we benefit from our access to 5AM’s infrastructure, in-house personnel, network and relationships. The 5AM team reviews hundreds of potential targets annually, with as many as 10 targets in active due diligence at a time. 5AM’s intensive due diligence efforts can range in duration from weeks to months and evaluate substantially all aspects of a potential target, including scientific, development, competitive, financial, management, deal structure and intellectual property assessments. 5AM’s ability to track companies supports identification of companies that our management is familiar with, that have raised venture capital financing and that may benefit from accessing the public markets. Further, we believe that the size of our offering will support a focus on companies which fall in 5AM’s “sweet spot” of investing and will differentiate us from larger special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, that may focus on later stage opportunities.
We believe that certain biotechnology companies will see material benefits from being publicly-traded, including greater access to capital, and more liquid securities. Based on 5AM’s and our management team’s experience as active participants in private financings and subsequent IPOs, we believe that we can provide a potential acquisition target with a fast and efficient path to going public by potentially combining a crossover financing and public offering into a single transaction, with a known investor syndicate and acquisition price negotiated upfront. Further, some SPAC merger events may include earnouts, and we believe that in some cases, the use of earnouts in SPAC merger events may positively distinguish merging with a SPAC from traditional IPOs, and may provide greater flexibility in pursuing early stage companies, while also providing assurance that investors and other equity holders in the private company can participate in the value creation through the granting of additional equity.
We have identified the following criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses, although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria. We intend to acquire one or more companies that we believe exhibit the following qualities:

● | Scientifically Differentiated: companies that are built on cutting-edge technologies and grounded in breakthrough science, specifically companies that are based on novel treatment modalities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Early Stage Companies: companies that have either (i) not established human proof-of-concept in clinical trials, but offer strong mechanistic rationale and preclinical data to support our conviction in future success and meaningful value creation, or (ii) established early clinical human proof-of-concept.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Addressing High Unmet Needs: companies addressing areas of significant unmet medical need that also represent meaningful commercial opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing Significant Benefits to Patients: companies developing therapies that have the potential to alter or significantly enhance the treatment paradigm for patients and physicians.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unique Competitive Positioning: companies developing therapies that are well-positioned to be potential “best-in-class” or “first-in-class” therapies in their respective categories and are expected to maintain a competitive advantage in the long-term.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Risk Diversification: companies with novel technology platform(s) or multiple assets under development that would offer risk diversification and opportunity to realize value inflection through multiple avenues.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value Arbitrage: companies with embedded or under-capitalized growth opportunities that are not widely recognized.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experienced Management Team: companies led by strong management and scientific teams that provide a platform for us to further develop the target’s management capabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company: companies that would benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experienced Investor Base: companies that have been funded to date by experienced biotechnology investors including venture capitalists, pharmaceutical companies and other institutional investors who have also provided strategic inputs to the company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Industry Opportunity
We believe that the biotechnology industry represents a significant and growing target market with a large number of potential acquisition opportunities. We believe that our investment strategy seeks to capitalize on the macro-environmental trends within the biotechnology industry. We believe that the biotechnology industry is attractive for a number of reasons, including:

● | Large and Growing End Markets: Global prescription drug sales are expected to grow from approximately $870 billion in 2019 to over $1.4 trillion in 2026, according to EvaluatePharma® World Preview 2020 report from July 2020 by Evaluate Ltd., driven by an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic disease and improved access to healthcare.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical Breakthroughs and Innovation: There has been a significant acceleration of medical research in recent years, leading to a better understanding of the molecular origins of disease and the identification of new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The biotechnology industry has also recently experienced an acceleration in discovery and validation of novel emerging treatment modalities such as genetic medicines and cell therapy, among others. Significant breakthroughs in medicine and science are leading to attractive investment opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Equity Market Environment: New biotechnology companies have been created at a significant pace over recent years, with a total of about 327 biotechnology companies completing IPOs in the United States between 2015 and 2021. Despite the equity market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a record year for biotechnology companies completing IPOs with more than $14.8 billion of capital raised in 77 IPOs and $23 billion of capital raised in 138 follow-ons, according to an analyst report.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for External Innovation at Larger Pharmaceutical Companies: Large and mid-cap pharmaceutical companies have become avid acquirers of biotechnology companies. They not only have the resources to acquire smaller biotechnology companies, but also the need to replenish their pipelines via external innovation. This has resulted in over 2,800 mergers and acquisition transactions within the biotechnology industry since 2015 through 2021, totaling more than $1,158 billion during this time period, according to data made available by PitchBook Data, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supportive Regulatory Environment: The significant pace of innovation is also reflected in the FDA’s recent drug approval rates, which have increased from 182 drug approvals in the five-year period from 2011 to 2015, to 256 drug approvals in the five year period from 2017 to 2021, reaching an all-time high in 2018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe early stage biotechnology companies will be significant creators of the future generations of medicines, and that we are well-positioned to benefit from this value creation via our investment and acquisition strategy.
Effecting a Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our IPO. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO offering and the private placement, additional placements of our shares, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that is preclinical and is not yet at the stage of commercial sales and marketing), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
5AM is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we will not consider a business combination or co-investment opportunity with any company that has already been selected by 5AM as a suitable candidate for it, unless 5AM, in its sole discretion, declines such potential business combination or makes available to our company a co-investment opportunity in accordance with 5AM’s applicable existing and future policies and procedures.
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must satisfy the 80% of net assets test at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in our company to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
In addition, our sponsor has indicated an interest to purchase $25,000,000 of our shares of Class A common stock in a private placement that would occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, our sponsor may determine not to purchase any such shares, or to purchase fewer shares than it has indicated an interest in purchasing. Furthermore, we are not under any obligation to sell any such shares. If we sell shares of Class A common stock to our sponsor (or any other investor) in connection with our initial business combination, the equity interest of investors in the combined company may be diluted and the market prices for our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, if the per share trading price of our shares of Class A common stock is greater than the price per share paid in the private placement, the private placement will result in value dilution to you.

Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, because many of these sources will have read this report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conferences. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with 5AM, our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of the foregoing, unless we have obtained (i) an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm as to the fair market value of the target business and that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view, (ii) the approval by our audit committee and (iii) the approval of a majority of our disinterested and independent directors. In no event will our sponsor or any of the members of our management team be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other similar compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must satisfy the 80% of net assets test at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority stockholders of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that is preclinical and is not yet at the stage of commercial sales and marketing), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of potential or actual customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.

6



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring costs and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finder’s or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses
The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must satisfy the 80% of net assets test at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must satisfy the 80% of net assets test at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our stockholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our stockholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. Because we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such arrangement to issue our debt or equity securities and have no current intention of doing so.
The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, or we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm as to the fair market value of the target business or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to have their public shares redeemed, regardless of whether they vote for or against (or vote at all with respect to) the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to exercise redemption rights with respect to any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares redeemed or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Stockholders may therefore have to wait 24 months from the closing of our IPO in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.

Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to exercise redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only 2,913,541 of our public shares (or approximately 35.3% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming that only a quorum was present at the meeting, that the initial stockholders do not purchase any shares of Class A common stock in the after-market).
If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
Redemption/Tender Rights
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to exercise redemption rights with respect to their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against (or vote at all with respect to) the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid; provided that a public stockholder, individually or together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to exercise redemption rights with respect to any public shares or private shares held by them to receive their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, holders other than our initial stockholders will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek redemption of their shares.
Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his or her public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, no matter when acquired.
We may also require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination or amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (1) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (2) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his or her shares if he or she wishes to seek to exercise his or her redemption rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise redemption rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to have their shares of Class A common stock redeemed to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for redemption. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their redemption rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to have its shares validly redeemed.

There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder exercising redemption rights. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise redemption rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
Any request to redeem or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his or her certificate in connection with an election of their redemption or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption or tender rights would not be entitled to have their shares redeemed to receive the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
If we do not complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, or October 16, 2022, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter (subject to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and applicable law), redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares (including any public shares sold in the IPO or any public shares that our initial stockholders or their affiliates purchased in the IPO or later acquired in the open market or in private transactions), at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of common stock and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of our company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month from the closing of our IPO and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

10



Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors, other than our independent registered public accounting firm, or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. The underwriter in our IPO will execute such a waiver agreement.
As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of the required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.00 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Our board of directors has evaluated our sponsor’s financial net worth and believes they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that may arise. However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations, as we have not required our sponsor to retain any assets to provide for its indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that it will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, our sponsor will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than approximately $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our initial stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their founder shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us redeem their respective shares of Class A common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

11



If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00.
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.
Amended and restated certificate of incorporation
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we hold a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (1) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (2) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will, in each case, provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to have their shares of Class A common stock redeemed, regardless of whether they vote for or against (or vote at all with respect to) the proposed business combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of Class A common stock to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise redemption rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months of the closing of our IPO, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account to all of our public holders of shares of Class A common stock;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | immediately after the consummation of our IPO, a certain amount of the net offering proceeds and certain other amounts as specified in our IPO registration statement shall be placed into the trust account (accordingly approximately $82.6 million ($10.00 per share) of the net proceeds of the sale of the shares in the IPO and the private placement were placed in a trust account);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction with another blank check company as our initial business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses that satisfy the 80% of net assets test at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We currently have five officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not currently anticipate having any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
We have registered our shares of Class A common stock under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, the financial information included in the proxy solicitation materials will need to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. The financial statements may also be required to be prepared in accordance with GAAP for the Form 8-K announcing the closing of an initial business combination, which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial information. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
We are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

13



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates does not equal or exceed $250.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues did not equal or exceed $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of any reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
