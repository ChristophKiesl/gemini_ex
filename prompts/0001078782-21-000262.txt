BUSINESS

Overview 
 
VolitionRx is a multi-national epigenetics company that applies its NucleosomicsTM platform through its subsidiaries to develop simple, easy to use, cost-effective blood tests to help diagnose a range of cancers and other diseases. We hope that through earlier diagnosis we can help save and improve the quality of human and animals’ lives throughout the world.
Volition’s Solution and the Science Behind It
 
Our assays are based on the science of NucleosomicsTM, which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid, since changes in these parameters are an indication that disease is present. 
Background to Genetics, Epigenetics and Cancer
 
Human genetics, the sequence of our DNA, is essentially a “recipe book” containing details of how to make each of the thousands of different proteins in the human body; simply put, there is a different gene (or recipe) for each protein. However, just because a recipe is in the book, does not mean you have to make it, and nobody makes all the proteins in their DNA. For example, men have all the genes necessary to make ovarian and uterine proteins but do not do so. Similarly, muscle cells do not make liver proteins or kidney proteins. This is because the genes for liver and kidney proteins are inactive or “switched off” in muscle cells. The mechanisms for the control of which genes are active or inactive in a cell are collectively known as epigenetics. 
 
There are many different types of cancers, but generally, the primary cause of a cancer is a mutation within a cell of the DNA encoding or regulating the expression of one or more specific genes called oncogenes. While many mutations cause no consequence, some can lead to the uncontrolled expansion of the mutated cells and their dissemination to other parts of the body from the tissue of origin in a process called metastasis. Another consequence of these mutations is an alteration in the epigenetic regulation of many other genes and this, in turn, can create a unique epigenetic signature in the cancer cells. 
 
Epigenetic control is therefore a critical factor in biology and medicine. A number of epigenetic cancer drugs have been in routine clinical use for more than a decade and the altered epigenetic signature seen in cancer underpins Volition’s diagnostic approaches.
 
A major mechanism for epigenetic control is mediated through chromosome and nucleosome structure. Each chromosome contains a long, single molecule of DNA that is coated by a complex array of proteins, mostly in the form of nucleosomes, giving the stretched-out, unwound DNA/protein core, or chromatin, the appearance of “beads on a string.” Unwound chromatin is accessible for reading (or transcribing) and “unwound” genes may be active. However, genes whose nucleosomes are coiled or supercoiled are inaccessible and inactive.
 
Figure 1 – A chromosome
 
Each nucleosome consists of a disc of eight histone proteins wrapped by a short length of DNA. Nucleosome structure has a dual role: first, it allows the compact storage and protection of the genetic material (or DNA), and second, it modulates the epigenetic regulation (transcription) of that DNA. This regulation is achieved through reversible chemical changes to both the DNA and protein components as well as through the binding of specific regulatory proteins to the DNA.

Volition’s Epigenetic Approach 
 
Volition’s approach is to investigate the epigenetic structure of chromatin and nucleosomes rather than investigating only the DNA sequence. We are continuously developing new technologies including:
 
·
A suite of low cost Nu.Q® immunoassays that can accurately measure nucleosomes containing numerous epigenetic signals or structure, now being developed on a range of different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, platforms. 
 ·
Nu.Q® Capture technology to isolate or enrich nucleosomes containing particular epigenetic signals or structures for a wide range of potential scientific and medical applications. For example, the enrichment of nucleosomes of tumor origin in blood samples taken from cancer patients. 
 ·
The production of synthetic (recombinant) nucleosomes, containing exact defined epigenetic signals and structures, is now in-house. These nucleosomes are used to ensure maximal accuracy of Nu.Q® immunoassay tests but also have many other applications including Research Use Only, or RUO, kits and as tools in epigenetic drug development. 
 
Improving Outcomes for Cancer Patients
 
The prospects for cancer patients vary greatly depending on whether the disease is detected at an early localized stage when effective treatment options are available, or at an advanced stage when the disease may have spread, and treatment is much more difficult. Unfortunately, most cancers are symptomless at early stage and most patients are not diagnosed until the disease has spread to other organs in the body and the likely outcome is poor. Simple low-cost immunoassay blood tests to detect cancer at an early stage leading to earlier treatment would greatly improve patient outcomes.
 
The Limitations of DNA Sequencing in Cancer
 
The advent of next generation sequencing has revolutionized medical research and led to a host of medical and other innovations. For example, sequencing the DNA of tumor tissue removed by surgery or biopsy uncovers cancer DNA mutations present in the tumor and is used to direct patient treatment selection, but tissue biopsy cannot be used routinely for cancer detection. 
 
However, small fragments of cancer DNA from dead tumor cells are also found in the blood of cancer patients so it is possible to sequence circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, in a blood sample taken from a patient to test for any cancer DNA mutations (e.g., mutated P53, KRAS, EGFR). Unfortunately, these ctDNA blood tests, often called liquid biopsy tests, have thus far also proved ineffectual for early stage cancer detection.
 
The main reasons why ctDNA tests alone have not proved useful for early cancer detection include: 
 
·
The level of DNA fragments circulating in the blood is very low. 
 ·
Only a small proportion of the circulating DNA fragments are of tumor origin and the proportion is especially low in early stage cancer (usually less than 1%). The remaining “healthy” DNA fragments originate mainly from dead white blood cells. 
 ·
A DNA sequence mutation will occur on only one in several million (up to 20 million) of the circulating DNA fragments that do originate from cancer cells. This means that cancer mutations are found in one in millions of a small percentage of a very low level of circulating DNA fragments, with the result that ctDNA is undetectable in most early-stage cancer patients. 
 ·
Many cancer-like mutations have recently been found to be present in the blood of healthy elderly people through a process known as clonal hematopoiesis. Any DNA released from these cells could lead to false positive readings. 
 
Volition’s Epigenetic Approach to Cancer, COVID-19 and Sepsis
 
Cancer is in essence a disease of genetic and epigenetic mis-regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the chromosomes of affected cells, leading to uncontrolled cell division and eventually to uncontrolled tumor growth and spread. Thus, the epigenetic signaling structures of chromosomes and nucleosomes are different in cancer cells and healthy cells of the same tissue.
 
When a cancer cell dies, its chromosomes are digested into nucleosomes as shown in the figure below. Most nucleosomes are metabolized, but some are released into the blood stream as circulating nucleosomes. The DNA attached to these nucleosomes is ctDNA. However, liquid biopsy companies extract only the DNA and discard the remainder of the nucleosome. 
 
Volition analyzes whole circulating nucleosomes containing particular epigenetic signals and structures using our low cost, but highly accurate Nu.Q® nucleosome immunoassay tests.

Figure 2 – Digestion of a chromosome into nucleosomes.
 
The epigenetic structure of nucleosomes of cancer origin are known to differ from that of nucleosomes from healthy cells. These epigenetic changes occur early and drive the development of cancer, for example by inappropriately activating oncogenes that promote cell division or inactivating tumor suppressor genes that repress cell division. However, the structural epigenetic changes that occur are not restricted to “1 in 20 million” nucleosomes or even to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, but are widely distributed, providing a larger cancer signal and enabling earlier detection of cancer. We use our Nu.Q® immunoassay tests to detect a variety of early stage cancers.
 
Circulating cancer nucleosomes also differ from nucleosomes of healthy origin in other ways. For example, the DNA fragments in cancer nucleosomes are approximately 20 base pairs (or about 14%) shorter than the DNA fragments in nucleosomes originating in healthy cells. This structural difference is used as the basis of one of Volition’s Nu.Q® Capture technologies to separate or enrich cancer nucleosomes by removing nucleosomes of healthy origin. Volition expects that Nu.Q® Capture technology will further increase the accuracy of its Nu.Q® immunoassay tests to detect early-stage cancers and will also be useful to ctDNA companies to decrease the cost and increase the accuracy of liquid biopsy tests. 
 
In terms of background science, white blood cells help protect the body against infection. White cells engulf invading viruses and bacteria and produce antibodies against them. In addition, white cells also eject chromatin material out of the cell to form Neutrophil Extracellular Traps, or NETs, which catch and trap invading viruses. NETs are a complicating factor in a wide variety of diseases including respiratory infections, SARS, and pneumonia as well as metabolic diseases, autoimmune conditions, inflammatory conditions, cancer, thrombosis, stroke and sepsis. 
 
While cancer remains our core disease focus, given the prominence of infectious diseases as a result of the pandemic we are also researching the use of our proprietary technology in infectious diseases 
with particular regard to NETosis and the activation and release of NETs in disease.
 
In a respiratory infection, white cells migrate to the lungs to protect them from the virus. Elevated levels of NETs are a clinical complication of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, associated with poor patient outcomes.
 
The ejected NETs material is made up of nucleosomes that can be detected in minute quantities using Volition’s Nu.Q® nucleosome assays. Indeed, we believe that we have the only available analytically validated quantitative nucleosome assay.
 
We believe the versatility of the Nu.Q® platform and the range of applications for which these assays can be leveraged may help increase diagnostic power and monitor disease progression and potentially treatment response across a range of infectious diseases that involve the over production of NETs, such as COVID-19, pneumonia, influenza and sepsis.
 
While NETosis is still a relatively new field for Volition, given positive early results, we have formed a Nu.Q® NETs team to provide increased focus and drive to the product development program.
 
Our COVID-19 studies in 2020 showed nucleosome levels correlated positively with strong significance:
 
·
with disease severity in the first wave COVID-19 patients, 
 ·
 with differentiation of patients with mild disease from those admitted to hospitals, and 
 ·
between those whom survived or died. 
 
We are now conducting studies of serial testing in second wave COVID-19 patients to determine how predictive our test is and hope to announce additional studies and data throughout 2021. We continue to research the use of our Nu.Q® technology for diagnostic and disease monitoring, and as a companion diagnostic to monitor treatment response in a variety of disease conditions.

Research and Development
 
Volition is developing NucleosomicsTM technologies in a number of areas including:
 
·
Adaptation and optimization of Nu.Q® immunoassay tests across multiple clinical platforms worldwide for the rapid quantification of epigenetic changes in blood and other biofluids. Volition’s Nu.Q® assays for use in clinical studies operate on a random-access immunoassay autoanalyzer approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, using a chemiluminescent magnetic particle-based assay format, a format which has enhanced analytical performance. Volition is pursuing both autoanalyzer and manual kit Nu.Q® platforms for use in its products, services and clinical studies. 
 
·
Nu.Q® assays (both the established plate format and the particle-based format mentioned above) are used for the development of Nu.Q® blood tests for the most prevalent cancers focusing initially on lung cancer, colorectal cancer and hematological cancers using our NucleosomicsTM biomarker discovery platform. Our development platform includes assays to be used for asymptomatic (screening) subjects, high-risk populations, symptomatic patients and to monitor disease progression and/or treatment response. We are developing blood based Nu.Q® assays to detect specific biomarkers that can be used individually or in combination to generate a profile which forms the basis of a product for a particular cancer or disease. 
 
·
Nu.Q® assays are used for the development of Nu.Q® blood tests for NETosis. We are developing blood based Nu.Q® assays to detect specific biomarkers that can be used individually or in combination to generate a profile which forms the basis of a product for a particular disease. Our development platform includes assays that may be used for diagnostic purposes and/or to monitor disease progression and/or treatment response. 
 
·
Nu.Q® Capture technology to isolate or enrich nucleosomes containing particular epigenetic signals or structures for complete analysis by mass spectrometry, DNA sequencing, immunoassays or other methods for a wide range of potential scientific and medical applications. For example, these applications include the enrichment of nucleosomes of tumor origin in blood samples taken from cancer patients for biomarker discovery, and widespread analysis of circulating chromatin fragments that include epigenetically active chromatin proteins. 
 
The Company has also developed the use of the Nu.Q® technology in veterinary applications and launched its first product, the Nu.Q® Vet Cancer Screening Test, in the fourth quarter of 2020. We are in the process of developing additional veterinary products, including a treatment monitoring test, a disease recurrence test and a point-of-care platform. Our extensive intellectual property portfolio includes the coverage of veterinary applications.

Commercialization Strategy
    Volition believes that given the global prevalence of cancer and diseases associated with NETosis, and the low-cost, accessible and routine nature of our tests, Nu.Q® could potentially be used throughout the world. Our launch sequence is largely determined by the regulatory hurdles we face; consequently, we aim to initially launch in Europe and Asia, and subsequently in the United States. We plan to work with partners to commercialize Nu.Q® worldwide. Additionally, we are working on complete nucleosome analysis in our Nu.Q® Capture technology. The goal of this project is to investigate ways to specifically target ctDNA. The ability to enrich ctDNA will allow us to use mass spectrometry to analyze histone and DNA modifications, and moreover to sequence the DNA present around the nucleosomes. This information might enable cancer diagnosis to identify the tissue of origin of that given cancer. 
 
Commercialization will take multiple forms in various markets and opportunities including, but not limited to:
 
·
Direct sales of the Nu.Q® Vet Cancer Screening Test via the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M University, or TAMU. 
 ·
Sales of veterinary clinical products utilizing Nu.Q®  Vet assays and/or Nu.Q® Capture reagents through distributor networks. 
 ·
Licensing of intellectual property, or IP, for clinical products utilizing Nu.Q® assays and/or Nu.Q® Capture reagents. 
 ·
Sales of clinical products utilizing Nu.Q®  assays and/or Nu.Q® Capture reagents through distributor networks. 
 ·
Licensing of IP for RUO kit sales of Nu.Q® assays and/or Nu.Q® Capture reagents. 
 ·
Licensing of IP for laboratory developed patient testing services utilizing Nu.Q® assays and/or Nu.Q® Capture reagents. 
 ·
Provision of direct research services in the processing of samples using Nu.Q® RUO assays and/or Nu.Q® Capture. 
 
If we do not have enough funds to fully implement our business plan, we will be forced to scale back our plan of operations and our business activities, increase our anticipated timeframes to complete each milestone or seek additional funding. In the event that additional financing is delayed, we will prioritize the maintenance of our research and development personnel and facilities, primarily in Belgium.
Our Market Opportunity
 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for around 9.5 million annual deaths globally. There are over 18 million new cases of cancer diagnosed each year and given the aging population this is expected to grow rapidly to over 29.5 million new cases annually by 2040. Currently, in the United States there are more than three new cases of cancer diagnosed and one person dies from a cancer-related cause every minute. Statistically, the chances of surviving cancer are greatly improved by early detection and treatment. However, there are currently very few blood tests for diagnosis of cancer in common clinical use. 
 
Volition believes that early, non-invasive, accurate cancer diagnosis remains a significant unmet medical need and a significant commercial opportunity. For these reasons, cancer diagnostics is an active field of research and development both academically and commercially.
 
The global in vitro diagnostic medical device, or IVD, market was $64.5 billion in 2017 and is forecasted to reach $93.6 billion by 2025, registering a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 4.8% from 2018 to 2025. The forecasted growth is due primarily to the increasing health care demands of an aging population. 
 
The veterinary market for early stage cancer diagnostics is also large and growing, with approximately 77 million pet dogs in the United States alone. Cancer in dogs is widespread. It is the leading cause of death for dogs over the age of 10 years and there are over 6 million new dog cancer diagnoses each year. As cancer screening is not as commonplace in animal health as it is in human health, we believe blood tests like our Nu.Q® Vet Cancer Screening Test could transform how veterinarians manage cancer in companion animals.
 
We believe that our low-cost and easy-to-use ELISA based screening blood test for the early diagnosis of cancer will help streamline the screening process, and improve the treatment and quality of life for up to a third of dogs with malignancies, including common malignancies such as lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma. These two malignancies comprise approximately 2 million cases out of a total of 6 million annual dog cancer diagnoses in the United States.
 
The United States is currently the largest veterinary market in the world and requires fewer and smaller clinical studies than the FDA process for human diagnostics. This generally allows for a much faster route to revenue for veterinary products as compared to human products.
 
We anticipate that because of their ease of use and cost efficiency, our tests have the potential to become the first method of choice for cancer diagnostics, allowing detection of a range of cancers at an earlier stage than typically occurs currently, and testing of animals who, for reasons such as time, cost or aversion to current methods, are not currently being tested. The initial veterinary focus is the United States and canines but in time we plan to launch products for other cancers, other species, in other countries and other indications such as disease monitoring and even a point of care test.

Our Competition
 
Volition anticipates facing competition primarily from other healthcare, pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies such as Exact Sciences Corporation, Guardant Health, GRAIL Inc., Freenome Holdings Inc, CellMax Life, Archer DX Inc., Foundation Medicine Inc., Oncocyte Corporation, OpKo Health Inc., MDNA Life Sciences Inc., Oncimmune Holdings Plc, Abbott Laboratories Inc., Cepheid Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., GE Healthcare, Siemens, Gen-Probe Incorporated, MDxHealth SA, Roche Diagnostics, EpiGenomics AG, and Thrive Earlier Detection Corp, and from companies such as Mars Incorporated, and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. focused on the veterinary space. There may also be other companies developing products competitive with ours of which we are unaware.
 
We predict that our future products will have a competitive edge compared to those offered by competitors on the basis that our tests are developed to be accurate, cost-effective, attractive from a government reimbursement perspective, easy to use, non-invasive, technologically advanced, and compatible with immunoassay systems, based on strong intellectual property and to be used for mass screenings.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and distribution systems than we have. Many of our competitors also offer broad product lines outside of the diagnostic testing market and have brand recognition. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our intended technologies and products becoming obsolete before we are able to enter the market, recover the expenses incurred to develop them or generate significant revenue. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop our intended products in a timely manner, keep our future products current with advancing technologies, achieve market acceptance of our future products, gain name recognition and a positive reputation in the healthcare industry, and establish successful marketing, sales and distribution efforts.
 
Government Regulations 
 
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the laws pertinent to our business have not been definitively interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. 
 
Both United States federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of diagnostic health care products. Our diagnostic products fall within the IVD medical device category and are subject to FDA clearance or approval in the United States. 
 
The federal government also has increased funding in recent years to fight healthcare fraud, and various agencies, such as the United States Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and state Medicaid fraud-control units, are coordinating their enforcement efforts.
 
In Europe, medical devices are regulated by self-certification through the Conformité Européenne, or CE, mark system. Under the system, developers and manufacturers must operate a quality system and validate medical devices in a limited clinical trial to demonstrate the manufacturer has met analytical and clinical performance criteria. We have implemented an International Organization for Standardization standard, or ISO 13485, Medical Devices – Quality management systems – Requirements for regulatory purposes, or ISO 13485. The standard addresses managerial awareness of regulatory requirements, control systems, inspection and traceability, device design, risk and performance criteria, as well as verification for corrective and preventative measures for device failure. Medical device companies such as ours are subject to pre-market compliance assessments from notified bodies, a European Union certification organization which the national authority, or the competent authority, of a European Union member state designates to carry out one or more of the conformity assessment procedures. ISO 13485 certification establishes conformity to specific European Union directives related to medical devices and allows CE marking and sale of the device.

The European Commission’s In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation 2017/746, or the EU IVDR, became effective in May 2017, marking the start of a transition period for manufacturers selling IVD devices into Europe. The EU IVDR, which replaces IVD Directive 98/79/EC, has a transition period of five years, after which the EU IVDR will apply in full, and no new applications pursuant to the former directive will be accepted. Manufacturers have the duration of the five-year transition period to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new, more stringent European Union regulatory requirements. We believe the most challenging changes under the EU IVDR will be those regarding the classification of products, which will bring almost all IVDs under the direct review and control of notified bodies, and the performance evaluation of IVDs, which will require extensive clinical and analytical performance studies but also demonstration of scientific validity. Additional requirements will apply to reinforce the safety of the products, such as extended responsibilities of the economic actors of the supply chain, increased post-marketing surveillance activities, unannounced audits from notified bodies, implementation of an improved traceability and transparency of the devices with, in particular, the introduction of the Unique Device Identification, or UDI, system and an expanded 
European Database on Medical Devices.
 
Notified bodies can begin auditing to the EU IVDR once they have been designated as a notified body under the EU IVDR by their competent authority. TÜV SÜD will be one such notified body. In practice, it will not be possible to CE mark a product according to the EU IVDR beforehand. We expect our devices will be deemed to be Class C devices under the EU IVDR, and the conformity assessment procedure for such devices will be a combination of quality management system audits and technical documentation assessments. The assessment time needed for a technical documentation assessment of a Class C device is expected to be between 2 to 6 months. We have commenced discussions with the TÜV SÜD to ensure compliance with the EU IVDR as soon as possible.
Regulatory Approach
 
Commercialization of our future products in the clinical IVD market (e.g., for patient diagnosis in hospitals, clinics, etc.) requires government approval (CE marking in Europe, FDA approval in the United States, and Chinese Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, approval in China).
 
In the United States, Volition anticipates that its tests will have to be cleared through the FDA’s premarket notification, or 510(k) process, or the FDA’s premarket approval, or PMA, process. The determination of whether a 510(k) or a PMA is necessary will depend in part on the proposed indications for use and the FDA’s assessment of the risk associated with the use of the IVD for a particular indication. A similar system operates in China through the CFDA. In the European Union, our tests can be marketed after a declaration and marking that the test conforms to the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation, or CE marking. The CE mark is also recognized in certain Asian territories, including India, for the private payer market.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Volition is developing clinical products based on the enrichment and analysis of epigenetically modified circulating nucleosomes using immunoassay, mass spectrometry, DNA sequencing and other methods. We have used this position to build a growing, broad, strong and exclusive patent portfolio around the ability to profile the epigenetic environment surrounding circulating chromosome fragments from diseased cells including the epigenetic signaling status of nucleosomes, DNA, and other epigenetic chromatin proteins.
 
Our patent portfolio includes 27 patent families and a total 64 patents granted related to our diagnostic tests (including veterinary applications), with 10 patents granted in the United States, 14 patents granted in Europe and a further 40 patents granted worldwide. Additionally, we have a total of 90 patent applications currently pending, with 11 patent applications in the United States, 8 in Europe and a further 71 patent applications worldwide.
 
We intend to continue our development of the Nucleosomics™ technologies and will continue to apply for patents for future product developments. Our IP strategy is to protect the technologies and gain market exclusivity with patents in Europe and the United States and in other strategic countries. The patents on the technologies underlying our products should provide broad coverage for each product, including protection through at least 2031.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 65 full-time equivalents compared to 50 as of December 31, 2019. We continually assess employee turnover, recruitment initiatives, compensation and benefits programs, safety in performing critical laboratory work, diversity and other matters relevant to human capital management, and we review results with our board of directors on a periodic basis. We aim to offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages in each of our locations and in each of our employee groups at each level around the globe as assessed with internal and external benchmarking data. We aim to build a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within the Company.
