 Item 1. Business
 JOANN is the nation’s category leader in fabric and sewing (collectively, “Sewing”) with one of the largest assortments of arts and crafts products. As a well-established and trusted brand for nearly 80 years, we believe we have a deep understanding of our customers, what inspires their creativity and what fuels their incredibly diverse projects. In order to best serve our customers, JOANN has transformed itself into a fully-integrated, digitally-connected omni-channel retailer that provides Creative Products to our customers whenever and however they want.
 As the nation’s category leader in Sewing with approximately one-third market share, based on our internal research estimates of market share of the Creative Products industry that primarily consist of a survey of Creative Product consumers as of July 30, 2022, we believe we offer the broadest selection of products while being committed to providing the most inspiration, helpful service and education to our customers. While we are the clear market share leader in a growing Sewing industry, which represented 46% of our total net sales in fiscal 2023, we also have significant share opportunity in the growing arts and crafts industry as we allocate additional space to these categories in our store refresh, remodel and relocation projects. We are well-positioned in the marketplace and have multiple competitive advantages, including our broad assortment, established omni-channel platform, multi-faceted digital interface with customers and skilled and knowledgeable team members. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its seasonal peak, averages more than 80,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) in store locations and over 200,000 SKUs online, across Creative Product categories. Approximately 50% of our in-store net sales cannot be directly comparison-shopped because of our strong and growing own-brand portfolio, including our copyrighted or proprietary fabric patterns and designs and factory direct relationships. We have expanded access to this broad assortment through e-commerce and digital capabilities that complement our physical network, drive customer engagement and deliver an exceptional customer experience while supporting consistently strong gross margins. Through our omni-channel platform, we serve our customers in a differentiated manner by offering several convenient fulfillment options, including buy online pick-up in store (“BOPIS”), curbside pick-up and ship-to-home offerings. Our omni-channel platform operates at a large scale, having generated approximately $271 million, $299 million and $511 million in net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our data-driven digital capabilities further reinforce our relationship with our customers. Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our mobile-first website, joann.com, both domestically and internationally, as well as our widely-used mobile application with more than 15 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we had approximately 81 million addressable customers in our vast database and approximately 20 million customers in our email database. These points of differentiation are reinforced by our knowledgeable, friendly and trusted team members, a significant number of whom are sewing and craft enthusiasts, who offer a service-oriented experience for our customers that we believe cannot be replicated by our competitors, mass retailers or pure online players.
 We appeal to an expansive customer base ranging across all ages, demographics and skill levels. We serve the do-it-yourself customer, including those who make to give or donate their creations, and supply small business owners with components to create and sell their own merchandise. We estimate this group makes up approximately one-quarter of our customers and typically resells on online marketplaces such as Etsy, eBay, Shopify and other platforms. Our customers are passionate and creative, using their hearts, hands and minds in their sewing, crafting and decorating activities. We believe our customers’ enthusiasm drives the JOANN culture. We strive to support our community of creators, and they create to support their communities by donating or gifting the items they make, such as blankets for hospitalized children, homeless persons and shelter pets. Our loyal core customer base is key to our sales growth, and for fiscal 2023, 44% of our net sales were generated by customers who had shopped with us in the preceding 52-weeks ("Returning Customers"). Since February 1, 2020, we have attracted over 15 million new customers. Customers typically purchase from JOANN with a project in mind that requires several component items. In that vein, we believe our physical footprint is an advantage, as most customers regularly want to explore what is new, see how various items and colors work together, see how a fabric drapes, feel the texture and seek help from our experienced team members.
 At JOANN, we continuously strive to improve the in-store and digital customer experience. We refine our assortment by conducting thorough reviews of focused categories at a product-level and store location layout-level in order to optimize sales and gross margin. We have an expansive data-driven digital footprint, which includes our extensive digital marketing assets, customer relationship management system ("CRM system"), social media platforms and e-commerce capabilities. We better understand our customers through our centralized database that brings together how each customer interacts in our physical and digital properties and provides a holistic view of their behavior. We are able to utilize this data to drive engagement with our brand, create loyalty and inspire, educate and ensure we are increasing our share of customer spend through timely and relevant marketing. By using data and digital contact channels, including email and SMS digital display, and leveraging our mobile application, we are able to contact customers with personalized content and provide the convenience to shop wherever and however they choose. We believe that these core initiatives and transformational investments have driven our performance and increased customer engagement over the last several years and strategically position us to create long-term value.


As of January 28, 2023, we operated 833 store locations in 49 states at an average size of approximately 22,500 square feet. Our store locations offer a complete selection of fabric and sewing accessories and an assortment of art, crafts, artificial floral, finished seasonal and home décor merchandise that varies based on store location size.
Sewing
46% of our total net sales were within the Sewing category in fiscal 2023. We offer a broad and comprehensive assortment of Sewing products in all of our store locations and online. These Sewing products offer our customers a combination of unique designs and fashionable trends at competitive prices. We are organized in the following categories for the convenience of the sewing enthusiast as well as those that utilize fabric for other crafting projects:
•cotton fabrics used in the construction of quilts as well as craft and seasonal projects; 
 •warm fabrications, such as fleece and flannel fabrics in both prints and solids, used for the construction of loungewear, blankets and craft projects;

 •seasonally themed and licensed fabric designs, including professional and collegiate sports teams and pop culture licensed prints, on a variety of fabrications to support a wide range of uses. 
 Arts and Crafts, Home Décor and Other
 The remainder of our total net sales in fiscal 2023 were within arts and crafts, home décor and other categories. We offer a broad assortment of merchandise for creative enthusiasts to support their arts and crafts as well as home decorating needs. We offer the following product assortments both in our store locations as well as online:
•yarn and yarn accessories, as well as needlecraft kits and supplies; 
 •paper crafting components, such as craft cutting machines, albums, paper, stickers, stamps and books used in the popular home-based activities of scrapbooking and card making; 
 •craft materials, including items used for stenciling, jewelry making, decorative painting, wall décor, food crafting and kids crafts; 
 •fine art materials, including items such as pastels, water colors, oil paints, acrylics, easels, brushes, paper, canvas as well as pencils and paper used for sketching; 
 •craft technology, organizers and other products that support multiple creative endeavors; 
 •artificial floral products, including flowers, artificial plants, finished floral wreaths and a broad selection of accessories essential for floral arranging and wreath making;

 •ready-made frames and, in several of our larger store locations, full service custom framing departments; 
 •a comprehensive assortment of books and magazines to provide inspiration for our customers; and 
 •other, including non-merchandise services. 


Marketing
Our marketing efforts are key to the ongoing success and growth of our brand. We engage a diverse customer base ranging across ages, demographics, interests and skill levels, from the novice to the experienced sewist and maker. Our primary focus with these efforts is to deepen the relationship with our customers, with a long-term focus of creating loyalty and helping our customers find their “Happy Place” at JOANN.
We leverage our proprietary customer database to provide relevant and timely communications to customers through multiple digital channels (email, SMS text, mobile application push notifications and display marketing), and to our most engaged customers via a robust direct mail program. This allows us to efficiently and effectively reach our target customers on a regular basis throughout the year. We rely primarily on digital marketing tactics to drive customer acquisition, including online display and search marketing, social media and affiliate marketing programs. Our retention marketing programs leverage a robust CRM platform and database that provides us a detailed view of customer behavior, combining sales in our store locations with online and social media activity. Through this database, we can personalize our digital marketing, email, SMS text and direct mail campaigns to ensure we are providing the most relevant content to our customer at all times.
Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our mobile-first website, joann.com, both domestically and internationally, as well as our widely used mobile application with more than 15 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we had approximately 81 million addressable customers in our vast database and approximately 20 million customers in our email database. Customers have the ability to shop their local store location online, with convenient omni-channel services available like BOPIS or curbside pickup. Customers can also choose to order direct to home, with extended aisle offerings across all major product categories. For customers seeking to purchase in greater quantities, we offer low pricing for bulk purchases through our JOANN+ service on joann.com or through our new wholesale service, Inspiration Direct. Those looking for inspiration and education can access thousands of projects in multiple ways and formats, including our digital platforms that offer thousands of project ideas, from novice to expert level, and include convenient shopping lists for each project. Customers seeking video tutorials can access free content both through joann.com and on the JOANN YouTube channel, where we post additional “how-to” videos. Finally, customers looking to build more advanced skills can gain access to Creativebug, our wholly owned subsidiary, which offers hundreds of longer form video tutorials from experts in the industry via a subscription. Our Creativebug website offers an extensive array of online arts and crafts instructional videos allowing customers to learn how to paint, draw, sew, quilt, knit, crochet and much more, while capturing the intimate experience of learning from top designers and artists.
We interact with customers and communities digitally and in person, through social media, multi-channel marketing campaigns, in-store and community events and on joann.com. Our highly active social networks are playing an increasingly significant role in our marketing, public relations and customer engagement. We utilize Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter and TikTok to inspire, educate, promote sales, introduce new products, share customer stories and offer customer service support and proactive brand engagement. We also have established relationships with key crafting and sewing influencers who help promote our brand, projects and product offerings. During fiscal 2023, we connected with our diverse team members and customers in a number of ways, including:
•Across its primary social channels, JOANN has amassed more than 3.6 million followers, and in fiscal 2023, we saw an organic reach of more than 82 million views on Instagram and Facebook alone. We also re-launched our TikTok account to engage with younger consumers, many of whom are looking to the platform for creative and do-it-yourself inspiration. Leveraging content creators, we received more than 16.6 million views on the platform in fiscal 2023. Pinterest is also a creative project destination, and JOANN saw more than 476 million impressions, 5.7 million Pin clicks and 727,000 Pin saves this fiscal year.
 •Our focus on making JOANN the most inclusive retailer in our space continued this year, and JOANN launched product collections and projects to support milestones and communities including Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Pride Month, Ramadan, Hanukkah and more. We also supported minority organizations with funding, volunteering and event sponsorships, such as the Martin Luther King Foundation, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network and Creatives Want Change, which is a designer-run program that assists aspiring Black design students. 
 •Giving back is intrinsic to our brand and, in fiscal 2023, JOANN team members and customers donated more than $6 million for charitable organizations, up 83% year-over-year. These include our continued partnerships with National 4-H Council, On Our Sleeves, the movement for children’s mental health, Susan G. Komen Foundation and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. We also launched a new partnership with Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals in fiscal 2023, connecting each of our store locations to a local children’s hospital for localized fundraising and community event support. We also continued our partnership with the Kids In Need Foundation, through which we donate products to schools and organizations supporting underserved youth. 
 We continue to explore partnerships to support and engage existing and potential customers and team members nationwide, and see great engagement and benefit to these programs. In fiscal 2023, JOANN was highlighted by Ad Age as a brand gaining popularity with

Gen Z and was also named one of America’s Most Trusted Companies by Newsweek, based on an independent survey collected from a vast sample of approximately 50,000 U.S. residents.
Purchasing
 We generally have multiple domestic and international sources of supply available for each category of products we sell. During fiscal 2023, we sourced 56% of our purchases from domestic suppliers with the remaining 44% of our products coming directly from manufacturers located in foreign countries, of which over one-third is sourced from China. To further support our direct sourcing strategic initiative, we opened our foreign sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2018. We continue to diversify our internationally sourced products by expanding in several other countries, including Pakistan, India, Vietnam, Taiwan, Turkey and South Korea. The focus on supplier diversification has allowed us to partially offset the negative impact of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Because of the increase in foreign sourcing, we need to order these products further in advance than would be the case if the products were sourced domestically, which in turn requires us to have a longer in-transit time for our merchandise and higher safety stock levels in our distribution centers and store locations. Our domestic suppliers also source internationally many of the products they sell to us.
Although we have very few long-term purchase commitments with our suppliers, we strive to maintain continuity with them. All purchases are executed centrally through our store support center, allowing store location managers and team members to focus on customer service and enabling us to negotiate volume discounts, control product mix and ensure quality. As of January 28, 2023, our top supplier represented 5% of our total annual purchase volume and the top 10 suppliers represented 22% of our total annual purchase volume. As of January 28, 2023, we were utilizing approximately 700 merchandise suppliers, with the top 125 representing 77% of our total annual purchase volume.
Logistics
We operate distribution centers in Hudson, Ohio, Visalia, California and Opelika, Alabama, all of which ship merchandise to our store locations on a weekly basis. The distribution centers also ship select products ordered by customers through joann.com directly to their homes. As of January 28, 2023, 91% of the products in our store locations were shipped through our distribution center network, with the remaining 9% of our purchases shipped directly from our suppliers to our store locations. As of January 28, 2023, 35% of outbound volume was supplied from the Hudson distribution center, 27% from the Visalia distribution center and 33% from the Opelika distribution center. During fiscal 2023, we began operations at our omni-channel fulfillment center located in West Jefferson, Ohio, which primarily provides e-commerce fulfillment directly to our customers.
 We transport product from our distribution centers to our store locations utilizing contract carriers. Merchandise is shipped directly from our distribution centers to our store locations using dedicated core carriers for 92% of our store locations. For the remainder of our store locations, we transport product using less than truckload carriers or through a regional “hub” where product is cross-docked for local delivery. We do not own or lease either the regional hub or the local delivery vehicles.
Store Location Operations
 Site Selection
We believe that our store locations are integral to our success. New and relocated sites are selected through a coordinated effort of our executive, real estate, finance and operations management teams. In evaluating the desirability of a potential store location, we consider both market demographics and site-specific criteria. Market criteria we consider important include, but are not limited to, our existing store location sales performance in that immediate market (if we have an existing store location), distance to other JOANN store locations, competitive presence, total population, number of households, median household income, percentage of home ownership versus rental and historical and projected population growth. Site-specific criteria we consider important include, but are not limited to, size of the store location, rental terms, size of the shopping center, co-tenants, traffic patterns, availability of convenient parking and ease of entry from the major roadways framing the store location.
Opening or Remodeling Store Locations
Our store location refresh program employs standard operating procedures to efficiently open new store locations or remodel or relocate existing store locations. We have developed processes to optimize inventory assortments and marketing programs for store locations that we open or remodel, which are under regular review to uncover opportunities to improve performance and consistency of

execution. We generally look to execute store location projects in the period from February through October to maximize sales and to minimize disruption to operations during our fourth quarter peak selling season.
Store Location Management
Each store location generally has a manager and an assistant manager. The remainder of staff is a combination of full-time and part-time team members based on each store location’s individual sales volume. Managers generally are compensated with a base salary plus a bonus, which is tied to individual store location and overall company performance.
We strive to promote our managers from within our assistant manager ranks as a result of high performance and completion of our internal management training program. Many of our team members, including managers, started as our customers and are enthusiasts within the Creative Products community. We believe this continuity serves to solidify long-standing relationships between us and our customers, and aids in our ability to provide exceptional service, as evidenced by our consistently high net promoter scores. When we relocate in the same market, we generally retain team members to staff the new store location. Each store location is under the supervision of a district manager who reports to a regional vice president.
We have geographic coverage for our store locations across the United States that we believe provides sufficient scale to efficiently leverage our e-commerce business, national marketing programs and logistics networks. The following table shows the number of store locations by state on January 28, 2023:

 | Total | | | Total
Alabama | | 7 | Nebraska | | 
Alaska | | | Nevada | | 5 
Arizona | | 18 | New Hampshire | | 8 
Arkansas | | 6 | New Jersey | | 11

Mississippi | | 6 | Wisconsin | | 24 
Missouri | | 15 | Wyoming | | 3 
Montana | | 7 | Total | | 833

 
The following table reflects the number of store locations opened, relocated and closed during each of the past five fiscal years:


Fiscal Year | New | Closed | In Operation at Period End | Expanded or Relocated | Total Square Footage at Period End (in thousands) | 
2019 | 7 | (3) | 869 | 10 | | 18,956
2020 | — | (2) | 867 | 10 | | 18,963
2021 | — | (12) | 855 | 6 | | 18,789
2022 | — | (7) | 848 | 5 | | 18,692
2023 | 1 | (16) | 833 | 27 | | 18,720

 

Our new store location opening costs depend on the building type, store location size and general construction and labor costs in the geographic area. Our relocation and remodel projects range in scope and cost based on the specific needs and sales potential of the store location being refreshed as well as the size of the store location, condition of the building and regional differences in construction costs. Components of cost for these projects include leasehold improvements (net of landlord financial contribution), furniture, fixtures and equipment, inventory (net of vendor support) and pre-opening labor and facilities expenses incurred during the project.
Blue Ocean Initiatives
 In addition to the advancements we have made in our store location refresh program and omni-channel platform, we are moving forward with a number of blue ocean initiatives expected to provide long-term profitable revenue growth. For example, Ditto is a joint venture with SVP Worldwide, that we expect will revolutionize the way consumers create, design and complete all of their sewing and crafting pattern projects. In addition, we have forged a strategic partnership with JDM Growth Group, a premier wholesale & e-commerce consulting firm, to develop new avenues for us in the business-to-business wholesale channel ranging from single-sellers all the way to multi-chain retailers. We believe these strategic initiatives will continue to help us differentiate ourselves in the Creative Products market as a leader in innovation and customer service.
 Competitive Landscape
We are the nation’s category leader in Sewing and have one of the largest assortments of arts and crafts products, serving customers in their pursuit of apparel and craft sewing, crafting, home decorating and other creative endeavors. We compete with select mass merchants, including Walmart, Inc. and Target Corporation, which dedicate a portion of their selling space to selling Creative Products items. We also compete with specialty retailers in the Creative Products industry, such as The Michaels Companies, Inc. and Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., as well as smaller regional and local operators.
In addition to e-commerce options offered by the retailers mentioned above, we compete with companies that sell fabrics and crafts only over the internet, such as Amazon.com. We estimate pure e-commerce players represent approximately 10% of the Creative Products industry. We believe that we are the only specialty provider of Creative Products that can serve customers holistically with an expansive assortment, service-oriented experience and integrated omni-channel capabilities.
Information Technology
Our point-of-sale systems and e-commerce platform record the sale of product at the item level. These transactions are collected and transmitted to our financial, merchandising, omni-channel fulfillment and reporting systems throughout the day. Information obtained from item-level transaction data enables us to identify important trends, provide customers and team members with updated inventory information, ensure our products are reliably replenished as sold, eliminate less profitable items and optimize product margins through analysis of our advertising, pricing and promotions.
Our store locations are equipped with broadband communication that is made available to customers so that our mobile e-commerce assets are able to augment our in-store customer service. The broadband service is also used within the store location to enhance the checkout experience and internal store location communications.
Our financial, merchandise and retail systems leverage enterprise software, complemented by other technology solutions for specific business processes where those other solutions are a better fit for our requirements. Those solutions include our portfolio of software for merchandise planning and replenishment as well as our human resource systems.
Human Capital and Team Members
We value and support our people through, among other initiatives, our diversity, equity and inclusion, talent acquisition and management, team member engagement and occupational health and safety initiatives, as well as our employment practices and total rewards programs.
Team Members
 As of January 28, 2023, we had approximately 20,000 full- and part-time team members, of whom approximately 18,100 worked in our store locations. The number of part-time team members is substantially higher during our peak selling season of September through December to support higher merchandising and customer service requirements. Many of our team members are Creative Products enthusiasts and relate to our customers’ passions. Our ability to offer flexible scheduling is also important in attracting and retaining team members, since approximately 75% of our team members work part-time.
Labor Relations
 We have one union representing a portion of the team members at JOANN. The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (the “Union”) currently represents team members who work in our Hudson, Ohio distribution center. As of January 28, 2023, approximately 1% of our team members were unionized. Our current contract with the Union expires on May 5, 2023, and relations with the Union are good. We have no other unionized team members.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 We have processes in place for compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) for our team members, requiring team members to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest, report actual or potential violations of the law, rules, regulations, ethics and the Code of Conduct and acknowledge their obligation to comply with the Code of Conduct. Ethics are deeply embedded in our values, business processes and culture. Respect and Responsibility is a core Company value and is the anchor for our Code of Conduct. We regularly reinforce our commitment to ethics and integrity in team member communications, in our everyday actions and through our processes. We also maintain a “Get Help Hotline” and email through which individuals can anonymously raise concerns or ask questions about business behavior.
Diversity and Inclusion
 JOANN has always stood for inclusivity, and we believe there is no room for discrimination of any kind in our Company or in our society. We are incredibly proud of the beautiful and diverse communities we serve, inspire and work beside. It is our responsibility to support those who are underrepresented in our industry, and to provide visibility for these groups. We aim to build a future together that focuses on treating all humans with the dignity and respect they deserve. For our team members, we have established an internal Diversity & Inclusion Council ("Council"), comprised of team members across the organization. The Council works collaboratively on ways to effect further change at JOANN, discuss current events and exchange open and honest dialogue about how diversity and inclusion can be enhanced at the Company. Through educational programs, cultural calendars, developmental workshops and learning tools, we are creating an environment where all team members can be their authentic selves and contribute at their highest level. During fiscal 2023, our team hosted a monthly education series open to all team members, featuring both internal and external speakers across a broad range of topics. We also traveled across the nation for a Diversity & Inclusion Roadshow to ensure all field team members are aligned to JOANN’s mission of inclusivity. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, Newsweek named JOANN one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity as well as one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Women.
Health and Safety
 The health, safety and wellness of our team members is our highest priority. Our goal is to achieve zero serious injuries through continued investment in and focus on our core safety programs and injury-reduction initiatives. Our focus on safety is reinforced each day through communication to our team members around safety awareness, risk identification and other essential safety protocols. Team members at our store locations and distribution centers receive specialized training to enhance our safety culture and reduce accidents.
Compensation & Benefits
 JOANN fosters a friendly, caring and flexible environment for its team members. Whether our team members are full-time or part-time, salaried or hourly, we offer benefits that fit their life. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our team members. All eligible team members can invest in their future by participating in the Jo-Ann Stores, LLC 401(K) Savings Plan (“401(K)

Plan”), which includes an employer match, or our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which provides an opportunity to purchase JOANN stock at a 15% discount. Full-time team members are offered medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, disability and life insurance coverage, paid time off and a merchandise discount. Part-time associates are offered dental, vision, supplementary life insurance and a merchandise discount.
Training and Development
 We offer all team members the tools, training and certifications to help them grow professionally. From initial onboarding to high potential leadership development, we believe in training and career growth for our team members. We actively attract, engage and hire talent who will connect with our vision and deliver on our mission. Our talent management team brings together performance management, talent assessment, succession planning and career planning. This team provides tools, resources and best practices to ensure we have the right talent in the right roles at the right time. We invest in executive coaching, assessments, internal development programs, external courses, peer networks, mentor programs and more.
 Trade Names
We do business under trade names for “Jo-Ann,” “JOANN,” “joann.com,” “Jo-Ann Fabrics,” “Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores,” “Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts,” “Jo-Ann Fabrics & Crafts” and “Creativebug,” as well as under numerous trade names relating to our private label products and marketing programs. We believe that our trade names provide significant value to our business.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time-to-time. Laws and regulations affecting our business may change, sometimes frequently and significantly, as a result of political, economic, social or other events. Some of the federal, state or local laws and regulations that affect us include but are not limited to:
•consumer product safety, product liability, truth-in-advertising and consumer protection laws; 
 •labor and employment laws, including wage and hour laws; 
 •tax laws, including those relating to the collection of state sales tax on e-commerce sales; 
 •data protection and privacy laws and regulations; 
 •environmental laws and regulations; 
 •trade, anti-bribery, customs or import and export laws and regulations, including collection of tariffs on product imports; and 
 •intellectual property laws. 
 Continued compliance with such laws and regulations could prove to be costly and could affect various aspects of our business. For example, increases in minimum wages or changes in wage and hour laws could limit our growth and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, with the trend in environmental, health, transportation and safety regulations becoming more restrictive, such as certain physical and electronic accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase.
 Seasonality
 Our business exhibits seasonality, which is typical for most retail companies. Our net sales are stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Net income is highest during the months of September through December when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage. Working capital needs to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season.
