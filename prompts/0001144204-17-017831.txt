--------+---------

OVERVIEW 
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel cancer immunotherapy products designed to utilize the power of the patient’s own immune system to eliminate cancer cells. We aim to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-licensing or bringing the technologies to market. We are currently developing our proprietary Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) engineered T cells (CAR-T) technology, which we licensed from Dr. Stephen Forman’s laboratory at the City of Hope National Medical Center (COH). CAR-T uses the patient’s own T cells to engage and destroy specific tumors. The process involves selecting specific T cell subtypes, genetically engineering them to express chimeric antigen T cell receptors and placing them back in the patient where they recognize and destroy cancer cells.
 
Several companies have promising CAR-T therapies that are in various phases of clinical and pre-clinical development and which target different cancer indications. Pursuant to the COH license agreement, we obtained an exclusive license to intellectual property rights pertaining to several CAR-T patents developed by COH for the treatment and diagnosis of all human diseases. Since the license is exclusive, worldwide and granted to us comprehensive rights as to use, manufacture and sale, thereby conveying practical ownership of the intellectual property to us. We therefore view such intellectual property as proprietary.
 
Our exclusive license and sponsored research agreement with Dr. Stephen Forman’s laboratory at the COH encompasses specific chimeric T cell constructions and enabling process technologies including linker technology improvements. This agreement covers the discovery, manufacturing and clinical development of novel CAR-T cells along with specified rights to any and all inventions.
 
We are currently in Phase 1 trials treating glioblastoma patients. Dr. Forman’s laboratory has developed MB-101, a proprietary engineered CAR-T cells targeting Interleukin13 Receptor a2 or MB-101, which is overexpressed on the surface of glioblastoma cells. On December 29, 2016 an article in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that a patient enrolled in the Phase 1 glioblastoma trial treated with MB-101 achieved a complete response.
 
We have started another Phase 1 study for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with CD123 specific CAR-T we licensed from COH (MB-102). Dr. Forman’s laboratory has developed a proprietary CAR-based targeting of CD123, which is overexpressed on the surface of AML cells.
 
Additionally, under our sponsored preclinical research agreement with COH, the COH is developing additional CAR-T cell constructions targeting a number of tumor associated antigens specific for the variety of solid and hematological malignancies. The effectiveness of certain of these additional CAR-T cell constructs already has been demonstrated in preclinical studies with mouse xenograft models of specific human tumors. Under the sponsored research agreement, we have the right to license newly developed CAR-T constructs. We intend to further pursue preclinical development to validate and seek to establish the proprietary nature of the most promising CAR-T approaches coming out of the sponsored research program and, if successful, we would license and take forward into clinical studies.
 
To date, we have not received approval for the sale of our product candidates in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from our product candidates.
 
We are a majority controlled subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”).

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT 
 
IL13Ra2 CAR-T Cell or MB-101 Program for Glioblastoma 
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancer, accounting for 15.1% of all primary brain tumors, and 55.1% of all gliomas. There are an estimated 12,120 new glioblastoma cases predicted in 2016 in the U.S. Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year olds in the U.S. While GBM is a rare disease (2-3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the U.S. and E.U.), it is quite lethal with 5-year survival rates historically under 10%. Standard of care therapy consists of maximal surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, are shown to extend median overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.
 
Immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Ra2 is an attractive target for CAR-T therapy, as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is over-expressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBMs. CAR-T cells are designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand (IL-13) mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y) with high affinity for IL13Ra2 and reduced binding to IL13Ra1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon, Cancer Research 2004).
 
We are developing an optimized CAR-T product incorporating enhancements in CAR-T design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence. We include a second generation hinge optimized CAR containing mutations in the IgG4 linker to reduce off target Fc interactions (Jonalaggada, Mol Therapy) as well as the 41BB (CD137) co-stimulatory signaling domain for improved survival and maintenance of CAR-T cells as well as extracellular domain of CD19as a selection/ tracking marker. In order to further improve persistence, central memory T-cells (TCM) are isolated and enriched. The manufacturing process limits ex vivo expansion, which is designed to reduce T cell exhaustion and maintain a TCM phenotype. These CAR-T modified TCM cells are shown to be more potent and persistent than earlier generations of IL-13 based CAR-Ts in mouse xenograft models of GBM.
 
We currently have an open IND to assess the feasibility and safety of using TCM enriched IL13Ra2-specific CAR engineered T cells for clinical study participants with recurrent/refractory malignant glioma. This IND was submitted on October 27, 2014, with COH as the sponsor. We have currently enrolled and treated the 17 patients as of December 31, 2016. Our collaborators at the COH presented the preliminary data for this first cohort of patients. The investigators reported that the CAR-T cells were well tolerated (meaning that no dose limiting toxicities were seen to date). The investigators also reported on a patient that they determined had a complete response to treatment (based on the imaging and clinical features set forth by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO)). This clinical response was sustained for 7.5 months after the initiation of CAR T-cell therapy, unfortunately, this patient’s disease eventually recurred at four new locations that were distinct and non- adjacent to original tumors. The next step is to continue to enroll patients in this Phase 1 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and a recommended Phase 2 dose. Additionally, in this Phase 1 study, we are exploring optimum modes of delivery for CAR-T cells for the treatment of GBM.
 
The clinical trial endpoints, which were first received on August 1, 2014 and are current as of July 7, 2016 are as follows:
 
Primary Objectives:
 
(1) To assess the feasibility and safety of intratumoral (stratum 1) or intracavitary (stratum 2) or intraventricular (stratum 3) or dual delivery (stratum 4) cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo expanded autologous central memory T cells (TCM)-enriched T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector to express a interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2)-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), as well as a truncated human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) (IL13 [EQ]BBzeta/truncated CD19[t]+ TCM) (IL13Rα2-specific, hinge-optimized, 41BB-costimulatory CAR/truncated CD19-expressing T lymphocytes), for research participants with recurrent/refractory malignant glioma.
 
(2) To determine maximum tolerated dose schedule (MTD) and a recommended phase II dosing plan (RP2D) for each strata based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the full toxicity profile.
 
Secondary Objectives:
 
(1) To assess the timing and extent of brain inflammation, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), following T cell administration.
 
(2) To describe cytokine levels (cyst fluid, peripheral blood) over the study period.
 
(3) In research participants who receive the full schedule of three T cell doses: estimate the six month progression free survival rate, disease response rates, and median overall survival.
 
(4) In research participants who receive intraventricular infusions after progressing following intracranial infusions (stratum 1 or 2): estimate disease response rate and overall survival if the sample size is large enough.

(5) In research participants who receive at least one dose of T cells estimate the mean change from baseline in quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and EORTC QLQ brain neoplasm (BN)-20 survey scale, domain and item scores during and post treatment.
 
(6) For study participants who undergo a second resection or autopsy: To evaluate T cell persistence in the tumor micro-environment and the location of the T cells with respect to the injection site, and to evaluate IL13Ra2 antigen expression levels pre and post T cell therapy.
 
CD 123 CAR T cell Program for AML 
 
Overview
 
CD123 is a subunit of the heterodimeric interleukin-3-receptor (IL-3R) which is widely expressed on human hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In addition, CD123 can be found on the surface of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), hairy cell leukemia, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
 
Of these malignancies, we are currently investigating CD123 as a target for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in AML since high CD123 expression is associated with enhanced AML blast proliferation, increased resistance of blasts to apoptosis, and poor clinical prognosis.
 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells characterized by rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow. AML is the most common form of acute leukemia. Although AML is a relatively rare disease there are approximately 20,000 new cases per year in the US and 10,000 deaths per year, accounting for approximately 1.8% of cancer deaths in the US (The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute). AML standard of care involves chemotherapy to induce remission followed by additional chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the preferred treatment route for AML following a second remission. It can lead to a 5-year disease free survival in 26% of patients. Unfortunately, however, currently, only about half of relapsed patients are able to achieve a second remission with traditional chemotherapy agents. Patients who do not achieve a second remission are much less likely to benefit from transplantation and face a dismal outcome.
 
The use of CAR-T immunotherapy in relapsed AML patients may offer the potential to achieve a complete or longer lasting remission. We have developed CD123 targeted CAR-T cells designed both to be activated to proliferate and to kill CD123 expressing tumor cells (Mardiros A, Santos C Dos. T cells expressing CD123-specific chimeric antigen receptors exhibit specific cytolytic effector functions and antitumor effects against human acute myeloid leukemia. Blood. 2013;122(18):3138-3148). The therapy is designed to recognize and eliminate leukemic cells, leading to remission in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, and could serve as a bridge to potentially curative allogenic stem cell transplant. The manufacturing process genetically modifies T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in order to express a CD123-specific, hinge–optimized, CD28 co-stimulatory domain expressing CAR as well as a truncated EGFR (EGFRt) selection/tracking marker (Wang Blood). EGFRt also has the potential to act as a safety switch to allow depletion of CAR-T cells in the patients if needed.
 
We have an open IND for a Phase 1 clinical study to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering CAR T cells and we have treated three patients as of December 31, 2016. This IND was submitted on April 20, 2015, with COH as the sponsor. We will assess the T cell persistence and determine the potential immunogenicity of the cells to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose.
 
The clinical trial endpoints, which were first received on June 6, 2014 and are current as of July 7, 2016 are as follows:
 
Primary Objectives:
 
(1) To assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo expanded T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector to express a co-stimulatory cluster of differentiation (CD)123-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (CD123R[EQ]28zeta[Z]/truncated human EGFR [EGFRt]+ T cells) (anti CD123-CAR/CD28-costimulatory, lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T lymphocytes) following lymphodepletion for patients with relapsed or refractory AML.
 
(2) To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).
 
Secondary Objectives:
 
(1) To assess activity in the form of T cell persistence and immunogenicity of CD123R(EQ)28Z/EGFRt+ T cells up to 28 days post T cell infusion.

-

Tertiary Objectives:
 
(1) To assess impact on hematopoiesis, change from baseline in numbers of CD123+ blood cells, CD123 expression on leukemia cells and hematopoietic cells, and the clinical efficacy of EGFRt mediated CAR T cell ablation.
COSTS AND TIME TO COMPLETE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
 
The information below provides estimates regarding the costs associated with the completion of the current development phase and our current estimated range of the time that will be necessary to complete that development phase for our product candidates. For a description of the risk factors that could significantly affect our ability to meet these cost and time estimates, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Product | Target Indication | Development Stage | Estimated time to complete phase | Estimated cost to complete phase
---------------+-------------------+-------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------
IL13Ra2-CAR- T | Glioblastoma | Phase 1/2 | First half 2018 | $2.5-5 Million 
CD123 CAR-T | AML | Phase 1/2 | Second half 2018 | $2.5-5 Million 

 
Completion dates and costs in the above table are estimates due to the uncertainties associated with preclinical research activities, clinical trials and the related requirements of development. In the cases where the requirements for preclinical development, clinical trials and development programs have not been fully defined, or are dependent on the success of other research findings or trials, we cannot estimate trial completion or cost with any certainty. The actual spending on each trial or the decision to advance programs to the next stage during the year is also dependent on funding.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS 
 
General 
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the US and in other countries.  Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broad intellectual property protection for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the US and elsewhere in the world.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors (“know-how”). To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.  To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have a few patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
 
Generally, patent applications in the US are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the US that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal.
 
If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.

In March 2015 we licensed intellectual property related to CAR-T technology from City of Hope. The intellectual property includes patent applications in a number of countries, including the US and the EU, as well as pending patent applications in Japan and the developing world. These pending patent applications include compositions and methods of creating CAR-T cells targeting IL13Ra and CD123. The applications include various claims regarding additional specific features to optimize targeting, binding specificity, cell stimulation and persistence. Additional patents and pending claims we have rights to include the use of optimized hinge region for many targeted constructions such as CD19 along with compositions and methods to isolate and transfect T memory cells to improve cellular persistence. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2033.
 
In total, we have in-licensed four patents in the US and four patents outside the US. We are currently evaluating the terms of license agreements that would grant us 12 additional US patents and 36 patents outside the US.
 
Our sponsored research agreement gives us the right to first negotiation under specified maximum terms regarding any future inventions arising from Dr. Forman’s laboratory.
 
Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 
We depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, knowhow and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to execute confidentiality agreements and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, to agree to assign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
 
In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the US but for which the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first approval of a designated orphan product from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA approved orphan product.
 
LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS 
 
City of Hope Agreements 
 
In March 2015, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with COH (the “Original Agreement”) to acquire intellectual property rights pertaining to CAR-T technology. In April 2015, pursuant to the agreement, we paid COH an upfront fee of $2.0 million and granted COH 1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing 10% ownership of Mustang, as of such date. In March 2017, COH was granted 293,588 additional shares of the Company’s Common Stock, valued at $5.73 per share or approximately $1.7 million as of October 2016, the effective date of the grant. The additional grant was made pursuant to the terms of the agreement, which maintained COH ownership at 10% until the Company raised net proceeds of $10.0 million from third party investors. The agreement was amended in February 2017, to allow for the grant of stock to be made in the Company’s common shares rather than Class A common shares as originally prescribed.
 
In addition, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with COH in which we will fund continued research in the amount of $2.0 million per year, payable in four equal installments, over the next five years.
 
On February 17, 2017, we and COH amended and restated the Original Agreement in connection with the covered patents by entering into three separate amended and restated exclusive license agreements, one relating to CD123, one relating to IL-13 and one relating to the spacer technology, that amended the Original Agreement in certain other respects, and collectively replace the Original Agreement in its entirety. The total potential consideration payable to COH by us, in equity or cash, did not, in the aggregate, change materially from the Original Agreement.
 
A&R CD123 License
 
On February 17, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with COH to acquire intellectual property rights pertaining to CD123 patent rights (the “A&R CD123 License”). Pursuant to the A&R CD123 License, we and COH acknowledge that an upfront fee has already been paid under the Original Agreement. In addition, an annual maintenance fee will continue to apply. COH is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $14.5 million upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Royalty payments in the mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products. We are obligated to pay COH a percentage of certain revenues received in connection with a sublicense in the mid-teens to mid-thirties, depending on the timing of the sublicense in the development of any product. In addition, equity grants made under the Original Agreement were acknowledged, and the anti-dilution provisions of the Original Agreement were carried forward.

A&R IL-13 License
 
On February 17, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with COH to acquire intellectual property rights pertaining to IL-13 patent rights (the “A&R IL-13 License”). Pursuant to the A&R IL-13 License, we and COH acknowledge that an upfront fee has already been paid under the Original Agreement. In addition, an annual maintenance fee will continue to apply. COH is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $14.5 million upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Royalty payments in the mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products. We are obligated to pay COH a percentage of certain revenues received in connection with a sublicense in the mid-teens to mid-thirties, depending on the timing of the sublicense in the development of any product. In addition, equity grants made under the Original Agreement were acknowledged, and the anti-dilution provisions of the Original Agreement were carried forward.
 
A&R Spacer License
 
On February 17, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with COH to acquire intellectual property rights pertaining to Spacer patent rights (the “A&R Spacer License”). Pursuant to the A&R Spacer License, we and COH acknowledged that an upfront fee has already been paid under the Original Agreement. In addition, an annual maintenance fee will continue to apply. No royalties are due if the Spacer technology is used in conjunction with a CD123 CAR or an IL-13 CAR, and royalty payments in the low single digits are due on net sales of licensed products if the Spacer technology is used in conjunction with other intellectual property. We are obligated to pay COH a percentage of certain revenues received in connection with a sublicense in the mid-thirties. In addition, equity grants made under the Original Agreement were acknowledged, and the anti-dilution provisions of the Original Agreement were carried forward. 
 
IV/ICV Agreement 
 
On February 17, 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “IV/ICV Agreement”) with COH to acquire intellectual property rights in patent applications related to the intraventricular and intracerebroventricular methods of delivering T cells that express CARs. Pursuant to the IV/ICV Agreement, we will pay COH an upfront fee of $125,000 within 30 days of the Effective Date, in addition to an annual maintenance fee. COH is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $125,000, upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Royalty payments in the low single digits are due on net sales of licensed products and revenue from sublicenses.
 
UCLA Agreement
 
On March 17, 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “UCLA Agreement”) with the Regents of the University of California (“UCLA”) to acquire intellectual property rights in patent applications related to the engineered anti-prostate stem cell antigen antibodies for cancer targeting and detection. Pursuant to the Agreement, we will pay UCLA an upfront fee of $200,000 within 30 days of the March 17, 2017, in addition to an annual maintenance fee. UCLA is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $14.3 million, upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Royalty payments in the mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products, and we are obligated to pay UCLA a percentage of certain revenues received in connection with a sublicense in the mid-single digits to mid-twenties, depending on the timing of the sublicense in the development of such product.
 
The term of the Agreement expires after the expiration of the last to expire of any of the patent rights under the Agreement. Either we or UCLA may terminate the Agreement upon notice to the other upon breach without remedy or upon insolvency. In addition, we may terminate the Agreement at will without cause after adequate notice.
 
COMPETITION 
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
 
The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development, or with marketing approvals, to treat conditions for which we are also seeking to discover and develop product candidates. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our product candidates and may be commercialized earlier.

The field of CAR-T therapy is extremely active. Companies and partnerships currently engaged in clinical trials with CAR-T modalities include Juno, Novartis/University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird Bio, Celgene/Baylor College of Medicine, Pfizer/Cellectis, Amgen/Kite Pharma, Bellicum, MD Anderson/Ziopharm and Intrexon.
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
As December 31, 2016, we have no fulltime employees and three part-time employees. We anticipate that each part-time employee will devote between 5 to 15 hours per week to Mustang. Employees of Fortress also make valuable financial, legal, scientific and other strategic contributions to Mustang on a regular basis.
SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING 
 
As an early stage development company, we rely on COH to manufacture all materials currently used in the clinical development programs we are sponsoring at COH. Pursuant to the March 2015 Licensing Agreement with COH, we have the right to make and have made the products, and we are currently negotiating Investigator-Initiated Clinical Research Support Agreements with COH which specify the manufacturing costs and numbers of patients which will be supplied under filed protocols. COH has extensive experience manufacturing clinical materials for development studies, but we are currently dependent on both their capacity limitations and continued operating success.
 
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities. We have established, or intend to establish, contract manufacturing relationships for the preliminary supplies of our product candidates, in each case with a single manufacturer. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the correct quality cannot be guaranteed, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.
 
At the time of commercial sale, to the extent possible and commercially practicable, we would seek to engage a back-up supplier for each of our product candidates. Until such time, we expect that we will rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce each of our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
 
We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Our contractors, if any, in Europe face similar challenges from the numerous EU and member state regulatory agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
 
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS 
 
Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of our product candidates has been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the US, any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.

The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the US. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 
The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its fast track drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for fast track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application (NDA). To receive fast track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:
 

· | that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the drug is intended to treat a serious aspect of the condition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs, and this potential is being evaluated in the planned drug development program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA must respond to a request for fast track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a fast track development program must continue to meet the criteria for fast track designation. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs ordinarily are eligible for priority review of a completed application in six months or less and also may be permitted to submit portions of an NDA to the FDA for review before the complete application is submitted.
 
Sponsors of drugs designated as fast track also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome.  Post-marketing studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA.  When required to be conducted, such post-marketing studies must also be adequate and well-controlled.  The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing studies with due diligence. Many companies who have been granted the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval. Moreover, negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we hope to conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame, if at all, and, therefore, could not submit the NDA to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval.
 
Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted.
 
For purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
 

· | Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:
 

· | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | insufficient supply of the product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | ineffectiveness of the product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of product candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
 
Sponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (SPA) from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a NDA. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy. 
 
Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA a NDA containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept a NDA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.
 
It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of a NDA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct sufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
 
As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.
 
If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA. Certain changes to an approved NDA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 
In the US, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
In the US and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including regulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act and further changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
International Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the US, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
