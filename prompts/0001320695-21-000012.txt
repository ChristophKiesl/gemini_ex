General Development of Business

TreeHouse is a leading manufacturer and distributor of private label packaged foods and beverages in North America. We have approximately 40 production facilities across North America and Italy, and our vision is to be the undisputed solutions leader for custom brands for our customers. Our extensive product portfolio includes snacking, beverages, and meal preparation products, available in shelf stable, refrigerated, frozen, and fresh formats. We have a comprehensive offering of packaging formats and flavor profiles, and we also offer clean label, organic, and preservative-free ingredients across almost our entire portfolio. Our purpose is to make high quality food and beverages affordable to all.
The Company was incorporated on January 25, 2005 by Dean Foods Company to accomplish a spin-off of certain specialty businesses to its shareholders, which was completed on June 27, 2005. Since the Company began operating as an independent entity, it has expanded its product offerings through a number of strategic and bolt-on acquisitions. We manufacture and sell the following:
•private label products to retailers, such as supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers, for resale under the retailers’ own or controlled labels;
•private label and branded products to the foodservice industry, including foodservice distributors and national restaurant operators;
•branded products under our own proprietary brands, primarily on a regional basis to retailers;
•branded products under co-pack agreements to other major branded companies for their distributions; and
•products to our industrial customer base for repackaging in portion control packages and for use as ingredients by other food manufacturers.
We operate our business as Bay Valley Foods, LLC ("Bay Valley"), Sturm Foods, Inc., S.T. Specialty Foods, Inc., Associated Brands, Inc., TreeHouse Foods Services, LLC, Protenergy Natural Foods, Inc., TreeHouse Private Brands, Inc., American Italian Pasta Company, Linette Quality Chocolates, Inc., Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc., Cottage Bakery, Inc., and The Carriage House Companies, Inc. in the United States, E.D.

Our Strategy
We make high quality food and beverages affordable to all. Our vision is to be the undisputed solutions leader for custom brands. Our mission is to create value as our customers’ preferred manufacturing and distribution partner, providing thought leadership, superior innovation and a relentless focus on execution. To achieve our mission we have developed a four point, customer-centric enterprise strategy, as depicted graphically and explained further below: 
•Commercial Excellence. An unrelenting focus on the customer must be at the heart of everything we do. To be a solutions provider, we must: understand our customers' needs and challenges; execute flawlessly; ensure products meet quality and safety standards and are competitively priced; and continue to innovate. We believe that our go-to-market platform will lead us to stronger and more valuable partnerships with our customers. During 2020, we partnered closely with our customers to prioritize and service the unprecedented retail demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while also driving forward new innovation in both our Snacking & Beverages and Meal Preparation divisions.
•Operational Excellence. We strive to be the supplier of choice and a world-class partner to our customers, a great investment to our shareholders, and a great place to work for our employees. We are building a high performance culture, as we communicate and engage our people with common metrics and operate with a continuous improvement mindset whereby the status quo is challenged. During 2020, the agility of our network of manufacturing and distribution facilities was evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as we swiftly and effectively implemented new social distancing and safety protocols to keep our frontline employees safe and facilities operating. Our swift actions coupled with the structural work we have completed over the last several years to drive operational excellence resulted in increased efficiency and profitability, and enabled us to differentiate through our ability to support customers and deliver on consumer needs. 
•Optimized Portfolio. We periodically review our portfolio in an attempt to identify areas of optimization. As part of this review, we may identify specific businesses (typically lower growth and lower margin) which may be better served by a fundamental change in tactics, strategy, or ownership. Optimizing our portfolio will allow us to focus our resources on fewer businesses in order to drive improved results and future cash generation. During 2020, we further optimized our portfolio with the divestitures of two In-Store Bakery facilities located in Fridley, Minnesota, and Lodi, California in the second quarter, and capitalized on an opportunity to strengthen our portfolio with the acquisition of Ebro's Riviana (as defined below) branded pasta business in the fourth quarter.
•People & Talent. We continue to build a performance-based culture by communicating clear goals and fostering decision ownership. Our goal is to align and incentivize our people and celebrate our successes together. In 2020, we prioritized the health, safety, and welfare of our employees and their families as we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures
On December 11, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the majority of the U.S. branded pasta portfolio as well as a manufacturing facility in St. Louis, Missouri of Riviana Foods, Inc. ("Riviana Foods"), a subsidiary of Ebro Foods, S.A. ("Ebro Foods"). The pasta acquisition is included in the Meal Preparation reporting segment.
On April 17, 2020, the Company completed the sale of two of its In-Store Bakery facilities located in Fridley, Minnesota and Lodi, California, which manufacture breads, rolls, and cakes for in-store retail bakeries and food-away-from-home customers. These two facilities were included within the Snacking & Beverages reporting segment.

Narrative Description of the Business
Our Segments
We manage and report our operating results through two divisions, which are our reportable segments: Meal Preparation and Snacking & Beverages.
Effective January 1, 2020, our reportable segments, and the principal products that comprise each segment, are as follows
•Meal Preparation - Our Meal Preparation segment is focused on productivity, efficiency and cash flow. Operational progress is driven by continuous improvement and value engineering. The organizational focus allows the Company to apply resources that better align with customers’ goals for driving value within the center of the retail grocery store. This segment includes center of the store grocery items (single-serve coffee, powdered creamer, dressings, dips, sauces, salsas, syrups, pasta sauces, jams and jellies, pickles, and cheese sauces) and main course meal items (dough, dry dinners, hot cereals, and pasta) in shelf stable and refrigerated formats for retail, food-away-from-home, industrial, ingredient, export and co-pack customers. We play a private label leadership role in several categories and offer clean label, organic, or better-for-you formulas in nearly every category. 
•Snacking & Beverages - Our Snacking and Beverages segment is focused on revenue growth, and research, development and commercialization is geared toward evolving consumer trends. The organizational focus enables the Company to apply the proper resources to meet its retail customers’ goals around experience, uniqueness and differentiation in private label. This segment produces and sells a comprehensive portfolio of sweet and savory baked food items (cookies, crackers, frozen waffles, pita chips, pretzels, snack bars and unique candy products) and beverages and drink mixes (powdered drinks, broths/stocks, ready-to-drink beverages, coffee/tea concentrates and bagged specialty tea) for retail, food-away-from-home and co-pack customers in shelf stable, refrigerated and frozen formats. Across many of our categories, we have a private label leadership role and can offer our customer partners a range of value and nutritional solutions, including clean label, organic and gluten free, so that they can meet the unique needs of their consumers.
See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by segment.
Sales
We sell our products through various distribution channels, including grocery retailers, foodservice distributors, and industrial and export, which includes food manufacturers and repackagers of foodservice products. We have an internal sales force that manages customer relationships and a broker network for sales to retail, food-away-from-home, and export accounts. Industrial food products are generally sold directly to customers without the use of a broker. Most of our customers purchase products from us either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that generally are terminable at will.
Products are shipped from our production facilities directly to customers, or from warehouse distribution centers where products are consolidated for shipment to customers if an order includes products manufactured in more than one production facility or product category. We believe this consolidation of products enables us to improve customer service by offering our customers a single order, invoice, and shipment. Some customers also pick up their orders at our production facilities or distribution centers.
We sell our products to a diverse customer base, including the leading grocery retailers and foodservice operators in the United States and Canada. Also, a variety of our customers purchase bulk products for industrial food applications. We currently supply approximately 800 total customers in North America, including 42 of the 74 largest non-convenience food retailers.
A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 58.5% of our consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 23.9%, 24.4%, and 23.6%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales. 
Markets
Our business faces intense competition from large branded manufacturers and highly competitive private label and foodservice manufacturers. In some instances, large branded companies manufacture private label products. The industries in which we compete are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years resulting in mass merchandisers and non-traditional grocers, such as those offering a limited assortment of products, gaining market share. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer large customers. Additionally, the introduction of e-commerce grocers brings new opportunities and risks. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers or gain new customers. Our customers do not typically commit to buy predetermined amounts of products, and many retailers utilize bidding procedures to select vendors. As the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industry continues, we could lose sales and profits if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold, or if limited assortment stores reduce the variety of products that we sell. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment in the retail and food-away-from-home channels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business.
We have several competitors in each of our channels. For sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are product quality, reliability of service, and price. For sales of products to food-away-from-home, industrial, and export customers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, specifications, and reliability of service.
Competition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers generally is based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Some of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do.
Recent trends impacting competition include an increase in snacking and awareness of healthier and "better for you" foods. These trends, together with a surge of specialty retailers who cater to consumers looking for either the highest quality ingredients, unique packaging, products to satisfy particular dietary needs, or value offerings where consumers are looking to maximize their food purchasing power, create pressure on manufacturers to provide a full array of products to meet customer and consumer demand.
We believe our strategies for competing in each of our business segments, which include providing superior product quality, effective cost control, an efficient supply chain, successful innovation programs, and competitive pricing, allow us to compete effectively.
Demand for our products is impacted by consumer behavior and preferences. The COVID-19 pandemic changed consumer behavior and changed preferences during 2020 to more at-home consumption instead of food-away-from-home consumption. This was a result of government shutdowns at restaurants and other public venues, as well as the general public's emphasis on personal safety. The Company's sales channels are primarily through the retail grocery channel, with approximately 80% of the net sales sold through this channel. As such, the Company has benefited from the increased consumer preference for at-home consumption and retail grocery shopping. Our food-away-from-home sales channel has historically accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales. The change in consumption patterns has adversely impacted sales in this channel. The majority of food-away-from home channel sales are within our Meal Preparation segment, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has mostly offset the benefit from retail grocery within this segment. However, our Snacking & Beverages segment is mostly comprised of retail grocery, and therefore, this segment has mostly benefited from the at-home consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For additional discussion for trends in market demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 7 - Recent Developments - COVID-19.
Resources
Raw Materials and Supplies: Our raw materials consist of ingredients and packaging materials. Principal ingredients used in our operations include casein, cheese, cocoa, coconut oil, coffee, corn and corn syrup, cucumbers, eggs, fruit, non-fat dry milk, almonds, oats, palm oil, peppers, rice, soybean oil, sugar, tea, tomatoes, and wheat (including durum wheat). These ingredients are generally purchased under supply contracts. We believe these ingredients generally are available from a number of suppliers. The cost of raw materials used in our products may fluctuate due to weather conditions, regulations, fuel prices, energy costs, labor disputes, transportation delays, political unrest, industry, general U.S. and global economic conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The most important packaging materials and supplies used in our operations are cartons, composite cans, corrugated containers, glass, metal cans, metal closures, and plastic. Most packaging materials are purchased under long-term supply contracts. We believe these packaging materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials and packaging supplies can adversely affect our performance, as price changes often lag behind changes in costs, and we are not always able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material and supply costs. 
For additional discussion of the risks associated with the raw materials used in our operations, see Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7 - Known Trends and Uncertainties.
Trademarks: We own a number of registered trademarks. While we consider our trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not consider any trademark to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business.
Seasonality
In the aggregate, our sales are generally weighted slightly toward the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced impact on profitability. As our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products. Products that show a higher level of seasonality include non-dairy powdered creamer, coffee, specialty teas, cappuccinos, hot cereal, saltine and entertainment crackers, in-store bakery items, refrigerated dough products, and certain pasta products, all of which generally have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters. Additionally, sales of broth are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Warmer weather products such as dressings, pickles, and condiments typically have higher sales in the second quarter, while drink mixes generally show higher sales in the second and third quarters. 
During 2020, due to shelter-in-place and social distancing measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw significant changes in product consumption patterns on our seasonality as consumers stocked their pantries and modified their purchasing habits in response to the pandemic. For additional discussion on product consumption patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 7 - Recent Developments - COVID-19.
Our short-term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital and are generally highest in the first and third quarters as inventory levels increase relative to other quarters, due to the seasonal nature of our business. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the first and third quarters, while cash flow is highest in the second and fourth quarters following the seasonality of our sales.
Government Regulation
The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, labeling, safety, transportation, and use of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we operate.
We are subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business including laws relating to water consumption and treatment, air quality, waste handling and disposal, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental compliance requirements.
Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
Human Capital
People & Talent is one of our four pillars of our enterprise strategy. Investing in people ensures our talent is capable of delivering upon our enterprise strategy. Our human capital initiatives are grounded in our set of values called The TreeHouse Way, which includes: Own It, Commit to Excellence, Be Agile, Speak Up, and Better Together. Aligning to these values enables our people to more effectively collaborate, execute, and take advantage of the growth opportunities for our business. We drive our culture and human capital strategies by embedding these values across the employee management process by operationalizing these values in our hiring practices, performance management processes, and our approach to leadership development and management training. Key areas of focus for the Company include:
Health and Safety: The safety of our employees is our number one priority. Our business could not operate without our team members, and our plant employees are essential to the success of our company. Employee health and safety is vital to achieving our mission, as is the health, safety, and well-being of all our employees and team members. We have enhanced our corporate resources to better support and ensure the safety of our people. We deployed Environmental, Health, Safety, Security, and Risk Management ("EHS&RM") systems, realigned and hired talented EHS&RM Managers and Divisional Directors, and integrated safety into our management operating system to increase accountability and reinforce the commitment to safety as a value. As a result, we saw a 40% reduction in the occupational injury rate ("OIR") from 2019 to 2020 and we continue to see performance improvement year over year in key EHS performance metrics for safety and risk management.
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion: The diversity of thought, background, and experience of our people has been and will continue to be a key driver of our ongoing success and ability to generate value for all of our stakeholders. We are developing a Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion ("DEI") strategic plan, which will contain four interconnected future work streams to focus on increasing black, indigenous, and people of color ("BIPOC") representation across our salaried workforce. These four work streams include developing enterprise infrastructure, expanding workforce representation, ensuring an equitable workplace, and stakeholder hiring partnerships and collaboration. As of December 31, 2020, 37% and 46% of our hourly and salaried workforce, respectively, were women, and 37% and 15% of our hourly and salaried workforce, respectively, were BIPOC.
COVID-19 Response: Our COVID-19 management plan was built around the need to support all employees in managing their personal and professional challenges. Frequent and transparent communications were the focus at every level of the organization including those on the front lines to those in our corporate offices. To operationalize this commitment, we enacted the following measures: 
•We established a dedicated COVID-19 response team, established a communication plan and an internal intranet site with weekly leadership communications to stay connected frequently and transparently with all employees. We partnered with medical professionals to inform our decisions, allocated resources, and established task forces to support and manage our company-wide response.
•For front line employees at our facilities, we added enhanced safety measures, published protocols, implemented social distancing, and added physical barriers to minimize exposure throughout our facilities. Our response included providing face masks to all employees at all locations, temperature screening, the installation of additional hand washing and hand sanitizing stations, and increased the frequency of enhanced cleaning procedures. We also provided incentives for our essential employees, including supplemental pay and additional paid leave.
•We instituted work from home for all office employees, provided additional IT resources, suspended all non-essential business travel, and established a task force to ensure employee safety. 
Because of our collective efforts, we have been able to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, maintain our operations safely and meet the needs of our customers and consumers.
As of December 31, 2020, our work force consisted of approximately 10,900 full-time employees, with 9,000 in the United States, 1,800 in Canada, and 100 in Italy. Approximately 2,500 were salaried, and 8,400 were hourly employees. Approximately 2,400 were union, and 8,500 were non-union employees. We have not experienced any material interruptions of operations due to disputes with our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
