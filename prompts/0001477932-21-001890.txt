Our Corporate History and Structure
 
AmpliTech Group Inc. (“AmpliTech” or “the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010. On August 13, 2012, the Company acquired AmpliTech Inc., by issuing 833,750 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the shareholders of Amplitech Inc. in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of AmpliTech Inc. (“the Share Exchange”). After the Share Exchange, the selling shareholders owned 60,000 shares of the outstanding 893,750 shares of Company common stock, resulting in a change in control. Accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which AmpliTech, Inc. was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the operations of the Company were consolidated for accounting purposes. The capital balances have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse acquisition.
 
AmpliTech designs, engineers and assembles micro-wave component based low noise amplifiers (“LNA”) that meet individual customer specifications. Application of the Company’s proprietary technology results in maximum frequency gain with minimal background noise distortion as required by each customer. The Company has both domestic and international customers in such industries as aerospace, governmental, defense and commercial satellite. 
 
On September 12, 2019, Amplitech Group Inc. acquired substantially all of the assets of Specialty Microwave Corporation (SMW), a privately held company based in Ronkonkoma, NY. The purchase included all inventory, orders, customers, property and equipment, and goodwill. Following the closing of the asset purchase, we hired all eight team members of SMW. In connection with the acquisition, the Company began using the trade name “Specialty Microwave”. The total consideration paid was $1,143,633, consisting of $668,633 in cash and a $475,000 promissory note with an interest rate of 6%. The Company also entered into a five-year lease on the property located at 120 Raynor Avenue, Ronkonkoma, NY with an option to buy the property during the first two years of the lease for $1,200,000 and then at fair market value for the remainder of the lease term. 
 
Specialty designs and manufactures passive microwave components and related subsystems for use in satellite communication ground networks that meet individual customer specifications for both domestic and international customers.

The COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant worldwide disruption throughout the course of 2020 and resulted in the imposition of various public and private sector measures to try to contain the virus, on a local, state, national and international level, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures have temporarily impacted our workforce and operations and some of the operations of our customers, and vendors, suppliers, and partners. The ultimate impact and efficacy of government measures and potential future measures is currently unknown. 
 
There is uncertainty regarding the business impacts from such measures and potential future measures. While we have been able to continue our operations through a combination of work-from-home and social distancing policies implemented to protect employees, these measures have resulted in reduced workforce availability. Accordingly, we resumed operations on May 5, 2020, with the CDC safeguard guidelines in place. Difficulties in communicating with our customers’ employees and delivery delays due to COVID-19 may impact our ability to meet customer demand, and thus decrease revenue into 2021 and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our Products
 
Our products consist of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including low noise amplifiers, medium power amplifiers, cryogenic amplifiers, and custom assembly designs for the aerospace, governmental, defense and commercial satellite markets. We also offer non-recurring engineering services on a project-by-project basis, for a predetermined fixed contractual amount, or on time plus material basis. 
 
Our existing product line includes the 18 to 40 GHz wide band low noise amplifier. It is designed mainly for wideband telecommunications such as military and space applications, point to point radios as well as test equipment.
 
Our new line of cryogenic amplifiers is designed to operate at temperatures as low as 4K that offer much lower noise figures than our standard models. Consuming as little DC power as +0.5V DC@8mA, the light weight, compact housings provide excellent performance while generating very little heat. These amplifiers are very useful for applications that require the absolute minimum amounts of noise injection for the growing market of low temperature applications, such as quantum computing, medical applications, RF imaging, research & development, space communications, accelerators, radiometry and telephony.
 
In connection with the acquisition of the SMW business, we began designing and manufacturing passive microwave components and related subsystems that meet individual customer specifications for both domestic and international customers.
