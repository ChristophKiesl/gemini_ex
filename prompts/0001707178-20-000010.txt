Item 1. Business
Our Company
On May 30, 2018, La Quinta Holdings Inc. (“LQH Parent” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “LQH”) completed the distribution to its stockholders of all the then-outstanding shares of common stock of CorePoint Lodging Inc. (“CorePoint Parent” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “CorePoint”), previously a wholly owned subsidiary of LQH Parent, following which CorePoint Parent became an independent, self-administered, publicly traded company (the “Spin-Off”).
CorePoint is a leading owner in the midscale and upper midscale select-service hotel segments, all under the La Quinta brand. We have elected to be treated, and currently qualify, as a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) for United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. 
2019 Highlights 

• | Net loss of $212 million, or $3.71 per fully diluted share, including a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million for 2019 as compared to a net loss of $262 million, including a non-cash impairment charge of $154 million, for 2018.


• | Paid quarterly dividends at an annualized rate of $0.80 per share.


• | Sold 44 hotels for gross proceeds of $177 million, resulting in a gain on sales of $32 million.


• | Reduced outstanding debt by $114 million.


• | Settled a dispute with Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Wyndham”) resulting in receipt of $28 million in 2019, with an additional $9 million to be paid by June 2021 (the “Wyndham Settlement”).


• | Completed the renovations of the hotels included in the 54-hotel strategic re-positioning program.

Our Properties
Our portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, consisted of 271 select-service hotels in the U.S. representing approximately 35,000 rooms across 41 states with locations in or near employment centers, airports, and major travel thoroughfares. All but one of our hotels are wholly owned. We primarily derive our revenues from our hotel operations.
As a select-service hotel owner, our hotels provide limited amenities. Our hotels generally offer limited food offerings (such as free continental breakfast), free internet access, free parking and a lower average daily rate (“ADR”) than a full-service hotel which may offer restaurants, banquet and meeting facilities, large lobbies, and other amenities. We believe guests are attracted to select-service hotels given their attractive value proposition. 
The rent potential for a hotel is measured by its ADR and is primarily a factor of its chain scale, location, local demand drivers and competition. Our ADR and occupancy by chain scale groupings commonly used in the lodging industry for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as follows: 

 | Number of Hotels | ADR | | Occupancy
Upper upscale | 3 | $ | 164.22 | | 78.6 | %
Upscale | 18 | $ | 130.40 | | 71.2 | %
Upper midscale | 57 | $ | 104.18 | | 66.2 | %
Midscale | 138 | $ | 83.14 | | 65.1 | %
Economy | 55 | $ | 62.45 | | 61.2 | %
Total | 271 | $ | 89.80 | | 65.3 | %

As an owner of hotels, we can capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand or increasing ADR. The cost structure of our typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and ADR increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. The profits realized by us are generally significantly affected by economic conditions, primarily changes in employment, gross domestic product, and inflation.
Hotel ownership is capital intensive, as we are responsible for the costs and capital expenditures for our hotels. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate additional capital projects, including expenditures for recurring maintenance as well as betterments and renovations, which are expected to drive higher revenues. We seek to invest in those hotels that we believe will provide an appropriate return on capital investment and maintain or increase property revenue and gross margin.
Brand Affiliation

All of our hotels currently operate under Wyndham’s highly recognizable La Quinta brand.  There are over 900 La Quinta hotels worldwide. We believe our properties derive value from their affiliation with the La Quinta brand and benefit from the operational expertise, extensive distribution network, strong commercial engines and additional resources of one of the nation’s largest hotel brands. 

As of December 31, 2019, nine of our hotels currently operating under the La Quinta brand have been identified that may, in the future, be re-flagged to operate under another Wyndham brand in accordance with our management agreements. 

Our Business, Growth and Financing Strategies 

Our objective is to generate favorable long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders through disciplined capital allocation, proactive asset management, maintaining balance sheet strength and enhancing the value of our properties. We intend to pursue this objective through the following strategies:

• | Disciplined capital allocation. We are a pure-play lodging REIT strategically focused on the midscale and upper midscale select-service lodging segments. The midscale and upper midscale segments are among the largest segments of the lodging industry by property count. These midscale hotels have historically generated higher margins than full-service and economy sectors. Midscale hotels have also performed better during economic downturns. We intend to focus on the top metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) markets, as well as other markets with close proximity to multiple demand generators, such as medical facilities, corporate offices, airports, convention centers, universities, and leisure attractions, with a diverse source of potential guests, including corporate, government and leisure travelers. Using these criteria, we have identified 105 hotels which constitute our core hotels. In addition, the mid-scale and upper mid-scale select-service lodging segments are highly fragmented. We believe there are opportunities to acquire hotels from smaller owner operators, particularly owners with a higher cost of capital. Such a disciplined acquisition strategy would allow us to expand our presence in target markets and in properties meeting our core hotel criteria, which will also provide diversification over time, including through the acquisition of hotels that are affiliated with other respected hotel brands and operators. 


• | Portfolio transformation. We have identified non-core hotels which do not meet our growth and return objectives. These include hotels not in our identified key markets or lodging segment and that are older with higher maintenance capital needs. As of December 31, 2019, we have identified 166 hotels as non-core which we plan to dispose of generally over the next two years. We believe that the execution of this disposition strategy, along with our proactive asset management of our core hotels, will enable us to maintain a geographically diversified portfolio and increase our revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) and gross margins, while reducing the average age of the portfolio and recurring capital expenditures. 


• | Build and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. We seek to build and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet that will provide us with liquidity to meet our operational and growth needs and support a well-covered dividend. As we execute our disposition strategy, we intend to use net proceeds to reduce our leverage over time to below 5.0x net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Adjusted EBITDAre. (See “Part II-Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definition and discussion of our non-GAAP measures.) During 2019, we used $114 million of our net hotel sales proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt. By initially reducing leverage, we believe we will have opportunities to further grow our portfolio, which could include revenue-enhancing improvements or acquisitions. We will also focus on preserving sufficient liquidity with minimal short-dated debt maturities and intend to refinance or extend our existing facilities.

We have a demonstrated record of identifying and executing on value-enhancing opportunities in our properties. In 2018, we began a strategic review of our hotel portfolio with the goal of improving operating performance and continued that review during 2019. During 2019, we sold 42 operating hotels, for gross consideration of $173 million and achieved gross revenue and Hotel Adjusted EBITDAre multiples of 2.5x and 31.8x, respectively. Excluding these hotels, our 2018 comparable RevPAR would have increased by approximately $3.00 and eliminated approximately $5 million of annual historical capital expenditures. Further, these hotels were sold at a revenue multiple of 2.5x, compared to our public market implied revenue multiple (based on our December 31, 2019 financial information and our publicly traded share price on February 28, 2020) of less than 2.0x. After the finalization of the Wyndham Settlement, we expanded our disposition strategy to include a new net total, as of December 31, 2019, of 166 non-core hotels. These non-core hotels are among our lowest performing hotels and we believe these dispositions will positively impact portfolio RevPAR and gross margin. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, 17 of these hotels have been sold and over 40 additional hotels are under contract to sell. 
In addition, we intend to create value through repositioning select hotels across brands or chain scale segments and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities to ensure our assets achieve their highest and best use. Further, we are continually focused on maintaining 
our properties and adapting to evolving customer preferences by making ongoing capital expenditures that will provide an acceptable return on investment.
Our Principal Operating Agreements

Management Agreements

On May 30, 2018, we entered into separate hotel management agreements with LQ Management L.L.C. (“LQM”), a subsidiary of Wyndham and currently the manager of all of our hotel properties, whereby we pay a fee equal to 5% of total gross revenues, as defined. Our management fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $40 million. 

LQM generally has sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels. LQM also provides all employees for the hotels, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels.  We have consultative and specified approval rights with respect to certain actions of LQM, including entering into long-term or high value contracts, engaging in certain actions relating to legal proceedings, approving the operating budget, making certain capital expenditures and the hiring of certain management personnel.  We are also responsible for reimbursing LQM for certain costs incurred by LQM during the fulfillment of their duties, such as payroll costs for certain employees and other costs that the manager incurs to operate the hotels.  The term of the management agreements is through 2038, subject to two renewals of five years each, at LQM’s option.  There are penalties for early termination.
Franchise Agreements
On May 30, 2018, we entered into separate hotel franchise agreements with La Quinta Franchising LLC (“LQ Franchising”), a subsidiary of Wyndham and currently the franchisor of all of our hotel properties, each with an initial term of 20 years. As franchisee, 12 to 24 months prior to initial expiration of the applicable franchise agreement, we have the opportunity to request a renewal term of an additional ten years by notice to the franchisor, payment of a renewal fee and execution of the franchisor’s then current form of franchise agreement.  The franchisor then has 60 days to make a determination whether to renew.  There are also penalties for early termination; however, both we and the franchisor have the option to cancel the franchise agreements in 2033, the 15th year anniversary, with no penalty to either party. Pursuant to the franchise agreements, we were granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use our franchisor’s brand names, marks and system in the operation of our hotels.  The franchisor also may provide us with a variety of services and benefits, including centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness as well as training of personnel.  In return we are required to operate our hotels consistent with the applicable brand standards.  
Our franchise agreements require that we pay a 5% royalty fee on gross room revenues. Our total royalty expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $40 million. 

In addition to the royalty fee, the franchising agreements include a reservation fee of 2% of gross room revenues, a marketing fee of 2.5% of gross room revenues, a loyalty program fee of 5% of eligible room night revenues, and other miscellaneous ancillary fees.  Reservation fees are included within rooms expense, and the marketing fee and loyalty program fees are included within other departmental and support expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  

Our requirement to meet certain brand standards imposed by our franchisor includes requirements that we incur certain capital expenditures, generally ranging from $1,500 to $7,500 per hotel room (with various specific amounts within this range being applicable to different groups of our hotels) during a prescribed period generally ranging from two to eleven years.  These amounts are over and above the capital expenditures we are required to make each year for recurring furniture, fixtures and equipment maintenance.  However, these amounts that we are required to spend are subject to reduction, in varying degrees, by the amount of capital expenditures made for hotels in the applicable group over and above the capital expenditures required for recurring maintenance in one or more years before receipt of the franchisor’s notice. The initial period during which the franchisor can notify us that we must make these capital expenditures is through 2028. At the franchisor’s discretion, subject to the franchise agreement provisions governing when such requirements may be imposed, the franchisor may provide a notice obligating us to meet those capital expenditure requirements generally within two to nine years of the notice. As of December 31, 2019, no such notices have been received; however, approximately 62% of our hotels are potentially eligible for such capital expenditure requirements. Through 2028, our remaining hotels will become eligible for such notices and capital expenditure requirements. We expect to meet these requirements primarily through our recurring capital expenditure program.

In connection with the sale of a hotel, where the buyer is assuming the franchise agreement, the franchise agreements provide certain obligations for the buyer which may affect the terms of our hotel sales. These provisions include the franchisor’s approval of the buyer, transfer fees and capital expenditure assessments to meet the franchisor’s current brand standards. In connection with the 
Wyndham Settlement, our franchise agreements were amended to limit the criteria for LQ Franchising’s approval of hotel sales and to establish certain objective criteria with respect to liquidity, net worth and operating experience required of proposed buyers.
Wyndham Settlement
In July and August 2019, we gave notice to LQM that we believed there were several events of default under the management agreements relating to all of our wholly owned properties. In resolution of the disputes, on October 18, 2019, we entered into the Wyndham Settlement, which included amendments to the management and franchise agreements. The significant terms were: (i) in connection with alleged revenue losses related to the Company’s hotel operations beginning in the second quarter of 2019, Wyndham agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, install and implement certain defined revenue management tools and processes, generally by the end of 2020, at Wyndham’s sole cost, (ii) in consideration for the alleged lost revenue, Wyndham agreed to pay in cash to the Company $20 million, $11 million of which has been collected as of December 31, 2019 and the remainder of which will be paid over time and satisfied in full by June 30, 2021; (iii) in final settlement of the income taxes incurred in connection with the Spin-Off , Wyndham paid $17 million to the Company; (iv) in consideration for the Company assuming certain hotel accounting responsibilities, Wyndham agreed to pay up to $500,000 per year to the Company beginning in May 2020; and (v) certain provisions related to franchisee transfers by the Company and hotel manager reporting and accounting obligations were clarified. In consideration of the above terms, the Company agreed to release claims against Wyndham (up to and including the date of the Wyndham Settlement) that the Company alleged in default notices under the management agreements. 
See “Part II-Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional discussion regarding the Wyndham Settlement.
Ground Leases

As of December 31, 2019, we maintained ground lease arrangements with third parties for 16 hotel properties that generally contain base rent and contingent rent provisions based upon the respective hotel’s revenues.  Many of these lease agreements contain renewal options at fair market value at the conclusion of the initial lease term.  The initial term maturity dates range from 2020 to 2096.  
Our ground lease rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5 million. We are also responsible for property taxes associated with the land parcel. Our ground leases are generally assumable by a hotel buyer in the event of a sale. In certain sale situations, we may be required to guarantee certain performance by the hotel buyer to the ground lessor. 
For certain ground leases, we may choose not to renew the lease. Our current debt agreements require us to exercise any ground lease renewals for properties encumbered by the loan during the term of the debt. For the ground lease that matures in 2020, with a property not encumbered by our debt, we do not expect to renew, and ownership of the property will be conveyed to the ground lessor. We may decide not to renew other leases, which may require us to pay off the applicable allocated debt principal.
Our Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we had 30 employees. We believe relations with our employees are positive.
Although not employed by us, our hotels are operated by employees who are employed by our hotel manager, pursuant to our management agreements. Our hotel manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels, including setting compensation amounts, benefits and other labor arrangements.  These expenses are generally reimbursed by us under the terms of the relevant management agreement. Accordingly, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor, which may affect our hotel manager’s staffing requirements and overall staffing expenses. As of December 31, 2019, our hotel manager’s employees at two of our hotels were represented by labor unions. We believe relations are positive between our hotel manager and its employees at our hotels.

For additional discussion of these relationships and risks associated with our hotel manager’s employees, refer to the section below “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.”
Competition
The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests on the basis of several factors, including the attractiveness of the facility, location, room rate, quality of accommodations, public and meeting spaces, brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands 
primarily in the midscale and upper midscale select-service segments. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, ADR and RevPAR of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability. We believe our hotels enjoy certain competitive advantages as a result of being flagged with nationally recognized brands, including access to centralized reservation systems and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, strong hotel management expertise and guest loyalty programs.

Our principal competitors include hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including other lodging REITs) and national and international hotel brands. We have also seen the emergence of a sharing economy with the increasing availability of online short-term rentals.  We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity investors, institutional pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and numerous local, regional and national owners, including franchisors, in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During the recovery phase of the lodging cycle, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers.

Seasonality and Cyclicality

The lodging industry is seasonal in nature. Generally, our revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. The timing of holidays, local special events and weekends can also impact our quarterly results and comparability to prior periods. The periods during which our properties experience higher revenues may depend on their specific locations and accordingly may vary from property to property. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue, profit margin, net earnings and cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, our quarterly results may be seasonally affected by the timing of certain of our marketing production and maintenance expenditures. In addition, certain of our management and franchising fees are based on revenues which, as noted above, vary by season. Further, the timing of opening of newly constructed or renovated hotels and the timing of any hotel acquisitions or dispositions may cause a variation of revenue and earnings from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, our results for any partial period may not be indicative of our full year results or trends.
Environmental Matters

We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our hotels include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our hotels. We are required to have operations and maintenance plans that seek to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our hotels, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

REIT Qualification

We are organized in conformity with and operate in a manner that allows us to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy requirements related to, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the real estate composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income generated by our REIT activities that we distribute to our stockholders; however, our taxable REIT subsidiary (our “TRS”) is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, and we may be subject to state and local taxes. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items.”
We intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders in amounts that meet or exceed the requirements to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT and to avoid corporate level taxation. Prior to making any distributions for U.S. federal tax purposes or otherwise, we must first satisfy our operating and debt service obligations. Although we currently anticipate that our estimated cash available for distribution will exceed the annual distribution requirements applicable to REITs to avoid corporate level taxation, it is possible that it would be necessary to utilize cash reserves, delay certain capital investments, liquidate assets at unfavorable prices or incur additional indebtedness in order to make required distributions.

Regulation

The lodging industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations in the U.S., including those relating to hospitality ordinances, data security, health and safety, building codes and zoning requirements. Hotels and their owners and operators are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing their relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our hotels, we may be required to expend funds to meet federal, state and local regulations. Any failure to obtain or maintain any such licenses or any publicity resulting from actual or alleged violations of any such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe that our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Insurance

We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property (including business interruption), terrorism, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our hotels. Certain of these insurance coverages are provided through policies obtained by our manager or jointly shared with our manager, primarily related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability, where we may be identified as a co-insured party.  Through all of these policies, our insurance provides coverage related to claims arising out of the operations of our hotels, where most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks. These policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insured retentions or deductibles, subject to the terms and limits of the policies.
Due to the combination of storm related claims generally experienced by the lodging industry and the older age of our hotels, we have experienced increased premiums and retention requirements from insurance carriers. We expect this to result in increases in operating expenses, self-insurance loss claims and loss mitigation capital expenditures. Some of these payments may result from our obligation to reimburse our manager under our management agreements.
