Item 1. Business.
Overview
Manning & Napier, Inc. is an independent investment management firm that provides our clients with a broad range of financial solutions and investment strategies for both wealth and asset management. Founded in 1970 and headquartered in Fairport, New York, we serve a diversified client base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions. The institutions we serve include 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley multi-employer plans, endowments and foundations. We serve clients through our Wealth and Asset Management divisions. Our Wealth Management private clients are primarily composed of individual investors and families, small businesses and business owners, and small- to mid-sized non-profit organizations, endowments, and foundations. Our Asset Management division includes our Intermediary Distribution Group, focused on delivering our investment strategies and expertise to third-party financial advisors, our dedicated Taft-Hartley team, and our Institutional and Consultant Relations teams, serving 401(k) plans, pension plans, large organizations, institutional investors, and third-party investment consultants.
Our objective is to create and provide financial solutions to help our clients meet their needs. We believe our differentiation is based on delivering comprehensive solutions, high-touch service, and effective investment strategies in a custom-tailored, highly integrated manner. 
We have built a diverse client base of high-net-worth individuals, small business owners, middle market institutions, larger institutions, defined contribution plans, and unions, as well as clients via investment consultants and other intermediaries. Although our client base is national, we are primarily focused in certain targeted geographic regions, including the northeastern and southeastern regions of the United States. Clients access our solutions and strategies via separately managed accounts, mutual funds, and collective investment trusts.
Our investment strategies are powered by multiple research engines, employing fundamental and quantitative approaches, and are offered as both single- and multi-asset class portfolios. While the mechanics of these processes may differ depending on the strategy, all of our strategies work from the underlying belief that active management is the best investment approach for meeting long-term client objectives. All of our multi-asset strategies fully incorporate dynamic asset allocation processes, and most strategies deliver active security selection as well.
We believe personalized financial advice is necessary to retain existing relationships and attract new clients. Our service approach is centered around our financial and advisor consultants, who manage the relationship and leverage internal subject matter experts for specific areas including financial planning, endowment and foundation consulting, qualified plan and pension plan services, and custody and trust advice and administration, depending on client need. We believe this team-based client service approach, value-added consultative services, and competitive long-term investment performance have allowed us to achieve a high average annual separate account retention rate.
The consistent philosophy and disciplined processes of our team-based, client-centric approach to investing has been central to delivering excellent investment outcomes to our clients for over 50 years. As of December 31, 2021, we have 20 publicly-available mutual fund share classes rated with four or five stars by Morningstar, and a number of our investment strategies have built value-added track records over multiple decades.
At times, our active approach to investment management can cause material deviations in portfolio positioning versus competitors and/or popular benchmarks. Over the long-term, we fervently believe our independent, truly active investment disciplines add value for clients, but over the short-run, periods of underperformance can occur. These short-term performance deviations, coupled with challenging industry trends, especially among institutional investors, can lead to changes in assets under management ("AUM") trends over time. The following chart reflects our AUM for each of the last 10 years:

As of December 31, 2021, our investment management offerings include 38 distinct separate account composites and 32 mutual funds and collective investment trusts. We believe we have cultivated a robust menu of actively managed strategies that allow us to address client needs.
Our AUM as of December 31, 2021 by sales channel and portfolio were as follows:

The following table summarizes the annualized returns for several of our key investment strategies and relevant benchmarks. Since inception and over long-term periods, we believe our strategies have generated attractive returns on both an absolute and relative basis. These key strategies are used across separate account, mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles, and represent approximately 78% of our AUM as of December 31, 2021. This table is provided for illustrative purposes only. The performance reflected in the table below is not necessarily indicative of the future results of our investment strategies.

Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis" in this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to provide financial solutions that enable clients to achieve their long-term goals and objectives. Our success will be measured by the success of our clients. We must effectively execute in delivering investment results, financial advice, and a superior client experience in order to retain business and attract new business. 
Our strategy is focused on continuous refinement and improvement. Our industry is continuously evolving, and we must relentlessly adapt our capabilities, talent, and culture to clients’ ever increasing expectations. This includes the performance of our investment strategies, the comprehensiveness of our financial advice, and the quality of our client service. These three areas form the foundation of our business and require constant evolution. 
 To meet these goals, our firm has a number of strategic initiatives in place that we believe are designed to position our firm for sustainable, lasting success. For more detail on where we stand with our ongoing strategic initiatives, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis" in this Annual Report for this discussion.
Investments 
We believe that skillfully deployed active management, in all of its many forms, is an effective investment approach to achieving client goals across changing market environments. Whether investing in a country, industry, or individual company, we hold a strong belief that price matters across all of our strategies. We are focused on helping our clients avoid permanent loss of capital over long time horizons, which is different than managing day-to-day volatility.
All of our research engines deploy investment processes that are team-based in nature. By focusing on research teams instead of individuals, we believe we are better able to emphasize repeatable processes instead of star personalities, while helping protect clients from staff turnover. Our investment processes are designed to allow teams to collaborate and combine top-down, bottom-up, and quantitative research. 
Additionally, we view environmental, social and governance ("ESG") integration as necessary for the future success of any investment manager. We have consistently considered ESG factors in our research analyses and risk assessments, and during 2021 we fully implemented ESG analysis throughout our fundamental, core investment processes for equities and credits. ESG integration is also part of our quantitative strategies, including our ESG multi-asset class exchange-traded fund ("ETF") strategies. We believe that in-depth insights on ESG factors, coupled with active engagement with companies and thoughtful voting in shareholder meetings, can be helpful in generating the investment outcomes our clients desire.
We believe our research department of several dozen primarily home-grown investment professionals enhance the consistency of our investment processes. As warranted, we may add to or supplement our research teams with additional investment professionals. 
Dynamic financial markets result in a fast-changing industry, and we recognize the need for our investment strategies to continuously evolve. We regularly review seeded portfolios to ensure that we are supporting competitive strategies that resonate with clients, while simultaneously closing portfolios that are no longer viable. As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $7.6 million invested in seed capital with our research teams in new strategy concepts and expect to continue to deploy capital to support innovation in the future.
Client Experience
Our business is based on confidence and trust. We believe we must deliver a client experience that communicates clearly, is collaborative, and is accountable to clients. We view our clients as our partners, and we recognize that building successful client-partner relationships leads to a natural expansion of our business.
As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 50 client-facing professionals, who are responsible for maintaining existing relationships and cultivating new business. Referrals are also a key source of new business, further highlighting the importance of our comprehensive client service and solutions. Our clients and client-facing professionals are supported by our client service and custody teams who provide ongoing administrative support and are an important component to maintaining relationships.
Our client-facing professionals focus on specific areas of expertise. Our Wealth Management group specializes in individuals and middle market relationships, including non-profits, small businesses, and other organizations, using a team-approach organized by region. In Asset Management, our Intermediary and Institutional teams cover wider territories and concentrate on larger institutions, consultants, and Taft-Hartley relationships, as well as third-party intermediaries. 
Alongside these professionals, our Advisory Services team of internal subject-matter experts provide consultative advice tailored to individual client needs. For example, our experts have capabilities ranging from estate plan and trust review for families, retirement plan design analysis for employers, and donor relations and planned giving services for endowments and foundations. 
Our marketing strategy is focused on finding new ways to connect and engage with clients and prospects via targeted content on products, services, and topics that are most relevant to our various audiences. We have dedicated resources creating engaging and relevant content that positions Manning & Napier as a thought leader and a trusted resource. This content strategy focuses on educating investors, and it mirrors the consultative nature of our firm. We disseminate content in various ways, including through print publications, email, webinars, live events, our website, and social media.
In order for our investment teams and client-centric personnel to be most effective, we believe we must also have excellence in our middle- and back-office functions. These include our technology, operations, human resources, and compliance functions, each of which play a critical role in forming the foundation of business success.
In particular, our technological strategy is focused on using software-as-a-service solutions while retaining in-house capabilities as needed. We believe that by leveraging the robust expertise of external providers, we can improve the nimbleness and efficiency of our organization. This approach provides the most up-to-date technology enabling a superior client experience, improving the employee experience, and streamlining operational processes. 
Competition
Historically, we have competed to attract business on the basis of:
•the breadth of financial solutions we offer clients in an integrated manner;
•the investment excellence and long-term track records of our strategies;
•the consultative advice we provide addressing clients’ unique challenges and needs;
•the quality of the client experience and the duration of our relationships with them; and
•the pricing of our solutions compared to competitors.
Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to retain our current investment and client-facing professionals and employees, as well as to attract highly qualified new professionals and employees. We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Structure
The Company was incorporated in 2011 as a Delaware corporation, and is the sole managing member of Manning & Napier Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Manning & Napier Group”), a holding company for the investment management businesses conducted by its operating subsidiaries. The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2021. The Company completed the exchange of 1,562,959 Class A units held by M&N Group Holdings, LLC ("M&N Group Holdings") and 30,010 Class A units held by Manning & Napier Capital Company, LLC ("MNCC"), the entirety of its ownership in Manning & Napier Group, on June 30, 2021 through the issuance of 1,592,969 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company. As a result, Manning & Napier acquired an equivalent number of Class A units of Manning & Napier Group and its ownership of Manning & Napier Group increased from approximately 89.0% to 97.7%. The diagram below depicts the Company's organizational structure as of December 31, 2021.
______________________
(1)The consolidated operating subsidiaries of Manning & Napier Group include Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC ("MNA"), Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc., Exeter Trust Company and Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier").
As of December 31, 2021, we had 279 employees, 270 of which are full-time, most of whom are based in our Fairport, New York office. During the COVID-19 pandemic almost all of our employees have been working remotely. 
Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level and by self-regulatory organizations. We are also subject to regulations outside of the United States. Under certain of these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate our business have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit regulated entities from carrying on business in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of registrations, censures and fines.
SEC Regulation
MNA and Rainier are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (the "SEC"), as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, (the "Advisers Act"). The Manning & Napier Fund, Inc., (the "Fund"), which is managed by MNA except for the Rainier International Discovery Series, for which Rainier serves as the sub-advisor, is registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, (the "1940 Act"). Additionally, Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc. (“MNBD”), distributor for the Fund, is registered with the SEC, as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act.
The Advisers Act, the 1940 Act and the Exchange Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers, mutual funds and broker-dealers. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act, and the Exchange Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of registration.
As an investment adviser, we have fiduciary duties to our clients that are broad and apply to our entire relationship with our clients. These duties require us to serve the best interest of our clients and not subordinate the client's interest to our own. The SEC has interpreted these duties to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things:
•trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts;
•allocations of investment opportunities among clients;
•use of soft dollars;
•execution of transactions; and
•recommendations to clients.
We manage accounts for a majority of our clients on a discretionary basis, which typically affords us the authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with designated trade executions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers, which effectively reduces certain of our expenses. We believe all of our soft dollar arrangements comply with the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. Constraints on our ability to use soft dollars as a result of statutory amendments or new regulations would increase our operating expenses and potentially hamper our investment process by limiting or eliminating access to vital research.
As a registered adviser, we are subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things:
•disclosure of information about our business to clients;
•maintenance of formal policies and procedures;
•maintenance of extensive books and records;
•restrictions on the types of fees we may charge;
•custody of client assets;
•client privacy;
•advertising; and
•solicitation of clients.
The SEC has authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate policies, procedures and systems to ensure compliance.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, 15% of our revenues were derived from our advisory services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, including 15% derived from our advisory services to the Fund. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and affairs and investment portfolios of the Fund and the investment portfolios of the funds we sub-advise, our own operations are subject to oversight and management by each fund’s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors must not be “interested persons” with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the “independent director” requirement). The responsibilities of the board include, among other things, approving our investment management agreement with the Fund; approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. Our investment management agreements with the Fund may be terminated by the funds on not more than 60 days’ notice, and are subject to annual renewal by the Fund board after their initial term.
The 1940 Act also imposes on the investment adviser to a mutual fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the adviser’s investment management fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC through administrative action or litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action.
Under the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment management agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in us. 
MNBD as an SEC-registered broker-dealer and distributor for the Fund, is subject to SEC rules and regulations, including the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires MNBD to maintain a certain level of liquid assets. MNBD complied with its net capital requirements during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
As a limited purpose broker-dealer, MNBD primarily acts as distributor of the Fund and offers only limited brokerage services to certain customers of the Fund. MNBD does not offer or sell securities, other than the Fund, provide investment advice or carry customer accounts. While MNBD and its financial professionals do not act in a fiduciary capacity, they are subject to the full scope of Regulation Best Interest. Under Regulation Best Interest, MNBD and its financial professionals must adhere to a higher standard of care and act in a customer’s best interest when making security, strategy or account type recommendations, including recommendations to invest in the Fund. 
FINRA Regulation
MNBD is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and as such is subject to the various industry and professional regulations, standards, and reporting requirements established by FINRA.
ERISA-Related Regulation
We are a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC"), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions.
The fiduciary duties under ERISA may be enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor by administrative action or litigation and by our benefit plan clients pursuant to a private right of action. The IRS may also assess excise taxes against us if we engage in prohibited transactions on behalf of or with our benefit plan clients.
New Hampshire Banking Regulation
Exeter Trust Company is a state-chartered non-depository trust company subject to the laws of the State of New Hampshire and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the New Hampshire Bank Commissioner.
Non-U.S. Regulation
Our sales and trading practices also subject us to certain foreign regulations. We have claimed an exemption from registration in Canada but are subject to those provincial regulations that apply to our limited operations in select Canadian provinces. Additionally, we invest globally and must adhere to country specific equity ownership reporting requirements in those foreign jurisdictions in which we invest. Our relationship with foreign domiciled clients or our sales and marketing efforts also could subject us to certain foreign regulations. We expect this trend to persist as such regulations increasingly have transnational application.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are the lifeblood of our business, and the long-term success of our clients and shareholders is highly dependent on the accomplishments of our people. To that end, we are heavily invested in the success of our people and work to ensure that there is strong economic alignment between our people and our clients and shareholders.
We believe deeply that character matters and that firms with great cultures and strongly held values stand a better chance of delivering excellent results for all stakeholders. We are fiduciaries, and for over 50 years, we have always understood in the most profound ways what it means to put clients' interests first. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 279 employees, the majority of whom are based in Fairport, New York. Women represented 42% of our workforce, while people of color represented 10%. The Executive Committee that is responsible for day-to-day operations of the firm is comprised of 33% female members, while 22% are people of color. Increasing the diversity of our firm, its leadership and its board is a stated objective for our management team and the board.
We are committed to a workplace of belonging, and our Committee for Diversity and Inclusion is a critical component in setting a tone where diversity is embraced, celebrated and utilized to drive better decision making and outcomes for all stakeholders. Our long-term goal is to have a workforce and a leadership team whose makeup is similar to the demographics of our country and the communities in which we do business. This will take time, but we are committed to making consistent progress. To that end, we have established goals against which we can measure our progress, specifically that 20% of new employees hired annually will be racially or ethnically diverse, and 50% will be women.
Our goal is to foster a creative and innovative workplace that is a reflection of our values and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse team of highly talented and engaged employees to deliver superior solutions and provide excellent service to our clients. We want to be a destination of choice for the most capable and promising talent.
We devote significant resources to ensure that we have a deep bench of talented employees that have the necessary training to perform their duties, including firm-sponsored training and development activities, assistance for continuing professional education and tuition assistance for academic programs.
We strive for high levels of employee engagement to support our values-based culture. We provide employees with the tools and flexibility to maintain a healthy work-life balance. We are committed to frequent and meaningful communication with employees, and solicit regular feedback from them, both informally and via survey data. We employ a comprehensive objective setting and performance review process to ensure clear feedback is given and people know what is expected and how they are doing. Consistent with our values, we encourage openness and healthy debate. 
Our compensation philosophy is designed to achieve alignment between our employees' interests and those of our clients and shareholders. Our investment professionals receive incentive compensation that is directly tied to the results they achieve for clients. While substantial outperformance allows our research personnel to earn more than their target bonuses, as they did in 2020, substantial underperformance yields a negative bonus that must be earned back in future years. Beginning in 2021, for our more highly compensated personnel, those making more than $150,000 in total compensation, a portion of their incentive compensation is deferred and invested in Manning & Napier mutual funds, ensuring that we are investing alongside our clients. We also award long term incentive compensation to about a third of our employees in the form of investments in Manning & Napier mutual funds that vest over 5 years. We utilize competitive benchmarking data to ensure that our compensation packages are fair and competitive.
We are committed to the communities in which we operate. We strongly encourage engagement of our staff in their efforts to give back and support our communities, providing them with paid days off for volunteering. Our corporate giving supports philanthropies delivering essential services to the most vulnerable, focusing on education, housing, food, and healthcare.
