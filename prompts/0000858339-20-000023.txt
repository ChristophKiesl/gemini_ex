ITEM 1. | Business

Overview 
Caesars Entertainment is a casino-entertainment and hospitality services provider with one of the world’s most diversified portfolios. We have established a rich history of industry-leading growth and expansion since we commenced operations in 1937. Our facilities typically include gaming offerings, food and beverage outlets, hotel and convention space, and non-gaming entertainment options. In addition to our brick and mortar assets, we operate an online gaming business that provides real money games in certain jurisdictions and offers retail sports wagering in certain jurisdictions.
CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own. CEC operates the business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries CEOC, LLC (“CEOC LLC”) and Caesars Resort Collection, LLC (“CRC”).
We lease certain real property assets from third parties, including VICI Properties Inc. and/or its subsidiaries (collectively, “VICI”).
Significant Transactions in 2019
Proposed Merger of Caesars Entertainment Corporation with Eldorado Resorts, Inc.
On June 24, 2019, Caesars, Eldorado Resorts, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Eldorado”), and Colt Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Eldorado (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 15, 2019, and as it may be further amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Caesars (the “Merger”), with Caesars continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Eldorado. On November 15, 2019, the respective stockholders of Caesars and Eldorado voted to approve the Merger. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2020. In connection with the Merger, Eldorado will change its name to Caesars Entertainment, Inc. See Note 1. 
Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino Disposition
On September 20, 2019, Rio Properties, LLC, a subsidiary of CEC, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions for certain assets of Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino (“Rio”). During the quarter ended September 30, 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $380 million, which included $6 million related to selling costs, as the carrying value was higher than the fair value. On December 5, 2019, the transaction was completed for a sales price of approximately $516 million. The sales price received includes $40 million in seller financing that we provided the buyer at a 9% interest rate, that is due to us in two years unless extended for an additional year. Interest may be paid monthly, or paid-in-kind at the option of the buyer. We received $470 million in cash proceeds, net of selling costs. In connection with the closing of the sale, we entered into a lease and trademark license under which we will continue to operate the property under the Rio trademark for an initial term of two years at an initial annual rent amount of approximately $45 million. See Note 1.
Consolidation of Korea Joint Venture
CEC has a joint venture to acquire, develop, own, and operate a casino resort project in Incheon, South Korea (the “Korea JV”). We determined that the Korea JV is a VIE and CEC is the primary beneficiary, and therefore, we consolidate the Korea JV into our financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, the construction schedule for the project has been delayed and discussions regarding the project costs between us and our joint venture partner remain ongoing. On February 11, 2020, the primary subcontractor notified us that construction on the project has ceased pending resolution of the go-forward options as explained below. In addition, the external debt financing by the Korea JV has also been delayed, which has impacted the timing of equity 
capital contributions by us, and our joint venture partner, in accordance with our joint venture agreement. We are currently in discussions with our joint venture partner regarding the project costs and financing plan for the project, as well as evaluating all of our options under the terms of the joint venture agreement. Possible outcomes include completing the project and related financing as originally budgeted, adding an additional equity partner, selling all, or part, of the parties’ ownership interest in the Korea JV, liquidating the joint venture or taking any other steps including those that we may agree with our joint venture partner. These possible outcomes could result in a material impairment of assets of the Korea JV and could also change our conclusion that we are the primary beneficiary of the joint venture, which could result in a material charge upon deconsolidating the joint venture. As reported by the joint venture and consolidated in our financial statements, as of December 31, 2019, total net assets of $133 million was primarily composed of property and equipment valued on a cost basis, net of construction payable, of which we have a 50% interest.
Emerald Resort & Casino, South Africa Disposition
In May 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell Emerald Resort & Casino located in South Africa for total proceeds of approximately $51 million. We own 70% of this property while the remaining 30% is owned by local minority partners. Total cash proceeds for our 70% ownership and other adjustments total approximately $41 million. The transaction is expected to close in 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the seller informed us that pursuant to certain conditions in the agreement that they wished to renegotiate the previously agreed upon sales price. We still believe the transaction will close in 2020 and therefore still meets the criteria of assets as held for sale as of the balance sheet date. See Note 2. 
Other Significant Transactions and Significant Events
CEO Transition
In April 2019, our Board of Directors named Tony Rodio as our Chief Executive Officer, replacing Mark P. Frissora, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, who served until April 30, 2019. Mr. Rodio’s appointment became effective on May 6, 2019. Immediately prior to joining the Company, he served as Chief Executive Officer of Affinity Gaming, and prior to that, he served as President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Tropicana Entertainment Inc. (“Tropicana”) for over seven years. Mr. Rodio has nearly four decades of experience in the gaming industry. 
CEOC’s Emergence from Bankruptcy and CEC’s Merger with Caesars Acquisition Company
Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (“CEOC”) and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) voluntarily filed for reorganization on January 15, 2015 (the “Petition Date”), at which time CEC deconsolidated CEOC. The Debtors emerged from bankruptcy and consummated their reorganization pursuant to their third amended joint plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) on October 6, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). As part of its emergence from bankruptcy, CEOC reorganized into an operating company (“OpCo”) separate from its real property assets (“PropCo”). OpCo was acquired by CEC on the Effective Date and immediately merged with and into CEOC LLC. CEOC LLC operates the properties and facilities formerly held by CEOC and leases the properties and facilities from VICI. See Note 4 for additional information.
On the Effective Date, Caesars Acquisition Company (“CAC”) merged with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company (the “CAC Merger”). See Note 4 for additional information. The CAC Merger was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control, which resulted in CAC being consolidated into Caesars at book value as an equity transaction for all periods presented.
Organizational Structure
As of December 31, 2019, through our consolidated entities and managed properties, we had a total of 53 properties, four of which do not have casinos, including one non-operational property, in 14 U.S. states and five countries outside of the U.S. In addition, we authorize the use of our brands and marks to a tribal casino property. Our facilities have an aggregate of over 3 million square feet of gaming space and approximately 40,000 hotel rooms. Of the 49 casinos, 36 are in the United States and primarily consist of land-based and riverboat or dockside casinos. Our 13 international casinos are land-based casinos, most of which are located in the United Kingdom.
We view each property as an operating segment and aggregate them into three regionally-focused reportable segments: (i) Las Vegas, (ii) Other U.S., and (iii) All Other, which is consistent with how we manage the business. Within these segments, our properties are primarily categorized as Leased (where we lease real property assets from third parties, including VICI), Owned-Domestic, Owned-International, and Managed. See Item 2, “Properties,” for more information about our properties.
4

Our All Other segment includes managed and international properties as well as other businesses, such as Caesars Interactive Entertainment (“CIE”).
Business Operations
Our consolidated business is composed of five complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino entertainment, food and beverage, rooms and hotel, casino management services, and entertainment and other business operations, including mobile sports betting. Upon CEOC’s emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the majority of its real property assets were sold to VICI and simultaneously leased back to us as part of the plan of reorganization. Additional transactions with VICI were subsequently completed to finance acquisitions and working capital purposes, resulting in cash proceeds and corresponding financing obligations. See Note 10 for additional information.
Casino Entertainment Operations
Our casino entertainment operations generate revenues from approximately 38,000 slot machines and 2,700 table games, as well as other games such as keno, poker, and race and sports books, all of which comprised approximately 51% of our total net revenues in 2019. Slot revenues generate the majority of our gaming revenues, particularly in our properties located outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
Food and Beverage Operations
Our food and beverage operations generate revenues from approximately 220 buffets, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos, as well as banquets and room service, and represented approximately 19% of our total net revenues in 2019. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants and buffets.
Rooms and Hotel Operations
Rooms and hotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our properties in our approximately 36,000 guest rooms and suites worldwide and represented approximately 18% of our total net revenues in 2019. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions.
We have engaged in large capital reinvestment projects in recent years focusing primarily on our room product across the United States, including renovating over 19,000 rooms in Las Vegas since 2015 at properties such as Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino (“Planet Hollywood”), Flamingo Las Vegas, Bally’s Las Vegas, Harrah’s Las Vegas, and Paris Las Vegas. In addition, we continue to roll out self-check-in kiosks in order to help reduce customer wait times and improve labor efficiencies.
Management Services
We earn revenue from fees paid for the management of eight casinos. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where Caesars Entertainment provides staffing and management services under management agreements. In 2018, we opened our first non-gaming properties, including two beachfront luxury resorts, a beach club, and a residential tower on Meraas’ Bluewaters Island in Dubai.
Entertainment and Other Non-Gaming Operations
We provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings at our properties. We operate various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood, both of which were ranked among the top theater venues in the United States in 2019 based on ticket sales. These award-winning theaters host prominent headliners, such as Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Keith Urban, Gwen Stefani, Rod Stewart and Shania Twain.
The LINQ Promenade and our retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. The LINQ Promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, and it features The High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel, and Fly LINQ, the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip.
In 2018, we broke ground on CAESARS FORUM, a 550,000 square-foot conference center located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. Scheduled to officially open in March 2020, CAESARS FORUM will feature 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, LEED silver-rating, and FORUM Plaza, the first 100,000 square-foot outdoor meeting and event space in Las Vegas. 
Sports-Related Business Operations
The Company is now live with retail sports wagering across seven U.S. states, including Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Iowa, Indiana and New York. The Company also operates the Caesars Casino & Sports app for mobile sports betting, which allows players in New Jersey and Nevada who download the app to place bets on sporting events. The players can also play over 400 casino games including slots, table games, and video poker. This product is expected to be launched in 2020 in Pennsylvania, where regulatory approval is pending, and is planned to launch in other states subject to receipt of regulatory approval there. 
The Company continues to solidify local and national partnerships that align our casinos, resorts and brands with sports fans. In 2019, we announced high-profile exclusive sports entertainment partnerships with the NFL, making Caesars the first-ever “Official Casino Sponsor” in the history of the league. This historic partnership combines the NFL’s legendary events with our properties to bring unique experiences to Caesars patrons. This includes exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks in the U.S. and U.K. to promote our properties, also enabling Caesars to host exclusive special events and experiences. For example, in April 2019, Caesars and the NFL hosted the NFL Alumni Las Vegas Draft Party with exclusive fan access to an autograph session with NFL Legends, giveaways and an open bar at the LINQ Hotel & Casino. Caesars will continue to host brand activations at prominent, high-profile NFL events, including the NFL Draft, NFL playoffs, and the Super Bowl during this multi-year partnership.
Additionally, in 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with ESPN pursuant to which, among other things, a new ESPN-branded studio will be built at the LINQ Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas where ESPN will broadcast sports betting-themed content and other programming. The new studio is expected to open in 2020. Under the agreement, Caesars has also been designated as ESPN’s “Official Odds Provider,” ESPN will produce and distribute certain content across ESPN’s media platforms that will feature Caesars branding, and Caesars will purchase advertising across ESPN and its affiliated advertising platforms, among other terms.
The Company also entered into an agreement in 2019 with Turner Sports, owner of Bleacher Report. Under the agreement, a Bleacher Report-branded studio has been established inside the sports book at Caesars Palace Las Vegas for the creation of a wide assortment of programming and editorial content to be regularly distributed through Bleacher Report and the B/R App. The agreement further provides for Caesars branding to be featured in certain Turner Sports and Bleacher Report programming and content, and for the parties to pursue other sponsorship, marketing and content opportunities together.
Our subsidiary, CIE operates regulated online real money gaming businesses in certain authorized jurisdictions, including in Nevada and New Jersey, owns the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) brand, and licenses the WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and services.
Sales and Marketing
On January 30, 2019, Caesars announced the rebranding of Total Rewards, the Company’s industry-leading loyalty program, to Caesars Rewards effective February 1, 2019. The new program leverages the premium Caesars brand to better connect Caesars’ elevated standard and prestige with the Company’s global destinations.
We believe Caesars Rewards enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among regions versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross-market strategy. We believe that operating multiple properties in the center of the Las Vegas Strip generates greater revenues than would be generated if the properties were operated separately.
Members who have joined Caesars Rewards can earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activity and qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at all Caesars-affiliated properties in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Dubai. Members can also earn additional Reward Credits when they use their Caesars Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Caesars Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits with Caesars for hotel amenities, casino free play and other items such as merchandise, gift cards, and travel.
Caesars Rewards is structured in tiers (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars), each with increasing member benefits and privileges. Members are provided promotional offers based on their Tier Level, their engagement with Caesars-affiliated properties, aspects of their casino gaming play, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used in connection with various marketing promotions, including campaigns involving direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines.
Intellectual Property
The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, 
copyright, or combination of several of our intellectual property rights, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate, including United States and foreign patent applications covering certain proprietary technology of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC (“CES”). We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. CES’ United States patents have varying expiration dates.
We have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great of an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property.
We own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Bally’s, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Paris, Caesars Rewards, WSOP, and licenses for the Planet Hollywood trademark used in connection with the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas and for the Rio trademark used in connection with the Rio in Las Vegas.
Competition
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. For example, the Genting Group is developing a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas, which is expected to open in 2021, and Marriott International and New York-based global real estate firm Witkoff are developing a casino and hotel called The Drew Las Vegas, which is expected to open in 2022. Both are located on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. In May 2018, MGM rebranded the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino as Park MGM, which underwent non-gaming renovations focused on room, food and beverage, and entertainment enhancements. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other.
In recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. For example, in Baltimore, Maryland, the opening of MGM Resorts National Harbor Resort & Casino and the addition of smoking patios at Maryland Live! has resulted in significant declines in revenue at our Horseshoe Baltimore property. The expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues. Atlantic City, in particular, has seen a significant decline primarily due to the addition of gaming and room capacity associated with the expansion of gaming in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania as well as the opening of new properties. This has resulted in several casino closings in recent years. In addition, Hard Rock Hotel Atlantic City and Ocean Resort Casino were introduced into the Atlantic City market in 2018, causing increased competition in the market.
Our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers.
We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on- and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. While we do not believe it to be the case, some have suggested that internet gaming and sports betting could also create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our brick-and-mortar operations. We believe that internet gaming and sports betting complements brick-and-mortar operations.
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K. 
Seasonality
We believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the markets in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, such as Easter (particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year), the WSOP tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently.
Governmental Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K.
Our businesses are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional discussion.
Employee Relations
We have approximately 64,000 employees throughout our organization. Approximately 27,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries relating to certain casino, hotel, and restaurant employees. The majority of these employees are covered by the following agreements:

Employee Group | Approximate Number of Active Employees Represented | Union | Date on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes Amendable
Las Vegas Culinary Employees | 12,500 | Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 | May 31, 2023 
Atlantic City Food & Beverage and Hotel Employees | 3,000 | UNITE HERE, Local 54 | February 28, 2020 
Las Vegas Bartenders | 1,200 | Bartenders Union, Local 165 | May 31, 2023 
Las Vegas Dealers | 2,400 | United Auto Workers | N/A - Currently in negotiations 

Corporate Social Responsibility, Citizenship and Sustainability
CEC’s Board of Directors and senior executives view Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) as an integral element in the way we do business, in the belief that being a good corporate citizen helps protect the company against risk, contributes to improved performance and helps foster positive relationships with all those with whom we connect. The Board of Directors and our executive management are committed to being an industry leader in CSR (which includes diversity, equity and inclusion, social impact, and environmental sustainability). In 2019, we continued to engage with our CEO-level external Corporate Social Responsibility Advisory board with experts representing diversity, business strategy, academia, and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our CSR priorities. These priorities are reflected in our tenth annual CSR report, published in 2019 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards.
Code of Commitment
Our Code of Commitment is our public pledge to our guests, team members, communities, business partners and all those we reach that we will honor the trust they have placed in us through ethical conduct and integrity. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY is the framework underpinning our CSR strategy and our support for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, aligning all our properties and corporate functions behind a common language and programs that support sustainable, ethical and profitable business growth. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY is also the organizing framework for the Code of Commitment in which we commit to:

• | People: supporting the wellbeing of our team members, guests and local communities.


• | Planet: taking care of the world we all call home.


• | Play: creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading Responsible Gaming practices in the industry.

Our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY strategy includes multi-year targets in key areas of impact, including science-based emissions-reduction, formally approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”), aligning with global best practices on climate change action. 
Responsible Gaming
In 2019 Caesars celebrated the 30th anniversary of its Responsible Gaming (“RG”) program. We train tens of thousands of team members each year and a cadre of RG Ambassadors throughout our properties to identify guests in need of assistance and provide support. In recent years, Caesars has contributed more than $1 million to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, the National Council on Problem Gaming and other state programs to help advance responsible practices in the gaming industry.
Environmental Stewardship
We take a proactive approach to environmental sustainability through our CodeGreen strategy established in 2007, consistently improving our performance across energy and greenhouse gas emissions efficiencies, reduction of water consumption and increasing waste diversion from landfills. Between 2011 and 2018, we reduced our absolute Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 24%. Last year, we further committed to mitigating our impact on climate change by updating our previously approved science based targets to be in line with well below 2 degrees Celsius per SBTi: (i) reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2050 from a 2011 base-year and (ii) having 60% of suppliers by spend institute science-based GHG reduction targets for their operations by 2023. Additionally, between 2008 and 2018, we reduced our annual water consumption by 10% and increased our waste diversion rate to 49% in 2018. 
In 2020, 100% of our owned or managed North American hotel resort properties once again achieved a 4 Green Key Hotel rating out of 5. Through 2019, our Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Atlantic City convention spaces received Green Key Meetings certification at the 4 key level, with Bally’s Atlantic City receiving 5 keys, the highest possible rating. Green Key is a rigorous program recognized by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council that ranks, certifies and inspects sustainable practices at hotels and resorts.
For our management, disclosure and engagement around Caesars environmental impacts, in 2019, Caesars Entertainment made the A Lists for climate and supplier engagement and received an A- score for water security from the CDP, an international nonprofit that drives sustainable economies. Just 3% of companies assessed are included on CDP’s Supplier Engagement Leader Board and 2% of companies disclosing climate impacts are included in the Climate A List.
In order to engage guests in our CSR efforts, we have branded our hotel rooms with our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY messaging, inviting guests to play a role by using water, air-conditioning and towels with the environment in mind. We promote sustainable sourcing of key food ingredients for our menus from sustainably managed farms and fisheries, and we are currently transitioning 
to sourcing 100% cage free eggs by 2025. In 2019, we further committed to sourcing, by 2024, chicken certified by the Global Animal Partnership which supports human animal welfare practices.
Employee Engagement, Development, Safety and Wellbeing
We aim to inspire our team members through our mission, vision and values, and our Code of Commitment. We invest in training and development for our team members and we reward them with opportunities to earn substantial rewards based on merit. Team members earn rewards each year in our Total Return program that acknowledges great service. We place utmost importance on creating a safe workplace for our team members, embedding standards and procedures so that all our colleagues have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make safe working a habit. We maintain a Wellness Rewards program to help our team members improve their health and wellbeing that has demonstrated improved health metrics for participating employees and their spouses/domestic partners, helping reduce the cost of healthcare for team members and for the Company. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We embrace diversity and aim to create an inclusive working environment that celebrates all our team members as individuals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) framework identifies five pillars of activity: advocacy, workplace, suppliers, communities and guests for a holistic approach to embedding DEI in everything we do. In 2018, 43% of leadership roles were held by women and 35% of our manager roles were held by employees of color. Caesars received a perfect 100% score on the 2020 Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index for the 13th year in a row. Furthermore, more than 13% of our addressable spend was with diverse suppliers in 2018. We maintain extensive outreach to discover diverse suppliers and support them through mentoring programs to gain business and grow with Caesars. 
Human Trafficking
We take a strong stance against human trafficking and commercial sex exploitation and have invested significantly in recent years to raise awareness among team members, creating a suite of educational materials including a dedicated online portal for team members, a toolkit and action guides. We trained customer-facing and security team members across our properties and have appointed several hundred volunteer Community Engagement Ambassadors as leaders in addressing sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. We continue to work as part of industry-wide partnerships to augment our efforts to eliminate all forms of exploitation from our operations and our supply chain.
Community Investment
Caesars Entertainment contributes extensively to our local communities to help them develop and prosper, through funding community projects, employee volunteering and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation, a private foundation funded from our operating income. In 2018, we contributed $69 million to communities through all these channels, including 343,050 reported employee volunteer hours. Many of our contributions are long-term collaborations, for example, our 17 years of partnership with Meals on Wheels America (“MOWA”) to combat the issues of senior hunger and isolation. Also, in 2019, we held our first Economic Equity Tour in six cities across the U.S. with a goal of helping create thriving communities by hosting educational workshops and expert-led webinars and providing resources in the areas of financial empowerment, nonprofit organization development, and entrepreneurship.
