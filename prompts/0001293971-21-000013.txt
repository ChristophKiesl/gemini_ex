Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform, gene editing and cancer immunotherapy capabilities. We believe that gene therapy for severe genetic diseases has the potential to change the way patients living with these diseases are treated by addressing the underlying genetic defect that is the cause of their disease, rather than offering treatments that only address their symptoms. Our programs in severe genetic disease include betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel; formerly LentiGlobin gene therapy for β-thalassemia); LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease, or SCD; and elivaldogene autotemcel (eli-cel; formerly Lenti-D gene therapy for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or CALD). Our programs in oncology are focused on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) T cell therapies. Idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel, and bb21217 are CAR-T cell product candidates for the treatment of multiple myeloma and partnered under our collaboration arrangement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS.
In January 2021, we announced our intent to separate our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, independent publicly traded companies, bluebird bio, Inc. and a new company, which we refer to as Oncology NewCo in this annual report on Form 10-K. bluebird bio, Inc. intends to retain focus on our severe genetic disease programs and Oncology NewCo is expected to focus on our oncology programs. The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2021 and is anticipated to be tax-free, subject to receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, ruling.
In June 2019, we received conditional marketing approval from the European Commission for beti-cel as a treatment for patients 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, or TDT, who do not have a β0/β0 genotype, for whom hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, transplantation is appropriate, but a human leukocyte antigen-matched, or HLA, related HSC donor is not available. We have begun commercializing beti-cel as ZYNTEGLO in the European Union, or EU, however in February 2021 we temporarily suspended marketing of ZYNTEGLO in light of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction, or SUSAR, of acute myeloid leukemia, and a SUSAR of myelodysplastic syndrome in our HGB-206 study of LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD which is manufactured using the same vector as ZYNTEGLO. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has paused the renewal procedure for ZYNTEGLO's conditional marketing authorization while the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee reviews the risk-benefit assessment for ZYNTEGLO and determines whether any additional pharmacovigilance measures are necessary. We are engaged in discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for regulatory approval of beti-cel in the United States regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT. Contingent upon successful resolution of the FDA's concerns arising out of the safety events in our SCD program, we currently expect to complete our biologics license application, or BLA, submission for beti-cel in mid-2021 for the treatment of all patients with TDT across all genotypes. We are engaged with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for ZYNTEGLO in patients with TDT and β0/β genotypes and patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age. 
Based on our prior discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek accelerated approval for LentiGlobin for SCD in the United States on the basis of clinical data from Group C of our HGB-206 clinical study, with our HGB-210 clinical study providing confirmatory data for full approval. However, in light of a SUSAR of acute myeloid leukemia and a SUSAR of myelodysplastic syndrome in our HGB-206 clinical study reported to us in February 2021, the FDA has placed our clinical studies of LentiGlobin for SCD on clinical hold. We are investigating these events and plan to continue to work closely with the FDA in their review of these events. In addition, we are also engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for LentiGlobin for SCD in Europe. 
In October 2020, the EMA accepted our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the EU for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval from the FDA for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD on the basis of our clinical data from our ongoing Starbeam study, safety data from our ongoing ALD-104 study, and the completed ALD-103 observational study. We currently expect to submit the BLA for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD to the FDA in mid-2021.
In collaboration with BMS, we are developing the ide-cel and bb21217 product candidates as treatments for multiple myeloma. We are co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel in the United States with BMS and we have exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. In September 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review the BLA submitted by BMS for ide-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We have exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for us to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In addition, we are independently pursuing next-generation BCMA-targeting CAR-T approaches for treating multiple myeloma. 
Our other programs in oncology include programs to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat other hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, MAGE-A4 positive solid tumors, and Merkel cell carcinoma. 
Our Platform
Our platform is based on lentiviral vectors which are used to introduce a functional copy of a gene to the patient’s own isolated HSCs, in the case of our programs in severe genetic diseases, or the patient’s own isolated white blood cells which include T cells, in the case of our programs in oncology. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or allogeneic HSCT, is an existing approach of treating a patient using HSCs contributed by a donor other than the patient that contain the properly functioning copy of the gene whose mutation has caused the underlying disease. However, this approach has significant limitations in the treatment of severe genetic diseases, including difficulties in finding appropriate HLA-matched donors and carries the risk of transplant-related rejection, graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD, and death. Our approach is intended to address the significant limitations of allogeneic HSCT while utilizing existing stem cell transplant infrastructure and processes. Also, because our approach has the potential to drive sustained expression of the functional protein encoded by the gene insert after a single administration, we believe the value proposition offered by our product candidates for patients, families, health care providers and payers would be significant.
Our Programs in Severe Genetic Disease 
Betibeglogene autotemcel
We are developing and commercializing beti-cel as a one-time treatment for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, a rare genetic disease caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the production of defective red blood cells. The disease is characterized by severe anemia, and the ineffective production of red blood cells can lead to a range of multi-systemic complications, including but not limited to splenomegaly, marrow expansion, bone deformities, and iron overload in major organs (as a result of blood transfusions needed to treat the disease). Our approach involves using a lentiviral vector to insert the normal β-globin gene with a single amino acid substitution into the patient’s own HSCs ex vivo, to enable formation of normal red blood cells, or RBCs, in patients. Beti-cel refers to the TDT patients' own cells that have undergone our ex vivo manufacturing process resulting in genetically modified HSCs. 
 In June 2019, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for beti-cel, marketed as ZYNTEGLO gene therapy, for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with TDT who do not have a β0/β0 genotype, for whom HSCT is appropriate but an HLA-matched related HSC donor is not available. In February 2021, we temporarily suspended marketing of ZYNTEGLO and the EMA has paused the renewal procedure for ZYNTEGLO's conditional marketing authorization while the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee reviews the risk-benefit assessment for ZYNTEGLO and determines whether any additional pharmacovigilance measures are necessary. In addition, the FDA has placed a clinical hold on our HGB-207 and HGB-212 clinical studies. Patient dosing is complete in each of these two studies, and there is no plan to enroll or treat additional patients in these studies. No cases of hematologic malignancy have been reported in any patient who has received treatment with beti-cel, however it is manufactured using the same BB305 lentiviral vector used in LentiGlobin gene therapy for SCD.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated a rolling submission of a BLA in the United States for beti-cel as a treatment of patients with TDT across all ages and all genotypes, which will be based on data from the Northstar study, the Northstar-2 study, and the Northstar-3 study. Contingent upon successful resolution of the FDA's concerns arising out of the safety events in our SCD program, we currently expect to complete our BLA submission for beti-cel in mid-2021. In addition, we believe the data from our Northstar-3 study, together with data from our Northstar study and Northstar-2 study and HGB-205 study, could be sufficient to form the basis for a MAA variation submission in the EU, for the treatment of patients with TDT and β0/β0 genotypes and patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age. 
Beti-cel has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA for β-thalassemia and was granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of β-thalassemia major. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to beti-cel for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia major, and rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of TDT. We participated in the EMA’s Adaptive Pathways program (formerly referred to as Adaptive Licensing), which is part of the EMA’s effort to improve timely access for patients to new medicines. In addition, the EMA has granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) eligibility for beti-cel.
We are conducting the following clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT:
•The Northstar-2 study (HGB-207) is an ongoing single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel to treat patients with TDT and non-β0/β0

genotypes. Twenty-three patients have been enrolled in the study, consisting of 15 adolescent and adult patients between 12 and 50 years of age at enrollment, and eight pediatric patients less than 12 years of age at enrollment. Age at enrollment ranged from four to 34 years old. To be enrolled, patients with TDT and non-β0/β0 genotypes must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the past two years. All patients must be eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched family HSCT donor. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of treated patients who achieve transfusion independence, defined as weighted average hemoglobin levels ≥9.0 g/dL without any RBC transfusions for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any time during the study after treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study are to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel on transfusion requirements and clinical events. Safety evaluations to be performed during the study include success and kinetics of platelet and neutrophil engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal dominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.
•The Northstar-3 study (HGB-212) is an ongoing single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of beti-cel to treat patients with TDT who have either a β0/β0, β0/IVS-I-110, or IVS-I-110/IVS-I-110 genotypes. As of March 3, 2020, 15 patients have been treated, and median age at enrollment was 15 years of age (ranging from four to 33 years). To be eligible, patients must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year for the past two years. All patients must be clinically stable and eligible to undergo HSCT, as well as having been treated and followed for at least the last two years in a specialized center that maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of treated patients who meet the definition of “transfusion independence.” The secondary endpoints of this study are to measure the proportion of patients who meet the definition of “transfusion reduction,” which is defined as demonstration of reduction in volume of RBC transfusion requirements (in mL/kg) in the post-treatment time period of months 12 to 24 compared to the average annual transfusion requirement in the 24 months prior to enrollment, to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel on transfusion requirements post-treatment and clinical events. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.
In June 2020, we presented the following updated clinical data from our Northstar-2 and Northstar-3 studies at the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress. All data presented at the EHA Annual Congress and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date of March 3, 2020:
•Efficacy results from Northstar-2 study (HGB-207): 
◦All 23 patients enrolled in the study had been treated, with a median follow up period of 19.4 months. 
◦Of the 19 patients with sufficient follow-up duration to be evaluable for the primary endpoint of transfusion independence, 89 percent of patients (17 out of 19) had achieved transfusion independence, with median weighted average total hemoglobin levels of 11.9 g/dL (ranging from 9.4 to 12.9 g/dL) over a median of 19.4 months of follow-up to date (ranging from 12.3 to 31.4 months). The 17 patients reaching transfusion independence previously required a median of 17.5 transfusions per year (ranging from 11.5 to 37 transfusions per year).
◦Improved iron levels, as measured by serum ferritin and hepcidin levels (proteins involved in iron storage and homeostasis), were observed and trends toward improved iron management were seen. Over half of patients stopped iron chelation therapy, which is needed to reduce excess iron caused by chronic blood transfusions. Seven out of 23 patients began using phlebotomy for iron reduction.
•Efficacy results from Northstar-3 study (HGB-212):
◦Fifteen patients (nine β0/β0, three β0/β+IVS1-110, three homozygous IVS-I-110 mutation) had been treated, with a median follow up period of 14.4 months (ranging from 1.1 to 24.0 months). 
◦Six of eight evaluable patients achieved transfusion independence, with median weighted average total Hb levels of 11.5 g/dL (ranging from 9.5 to 13.5 g/dL), and continued to maintain transfusion independence for a median duration of 13.6 months (ranging from 12.2 to 21.2 months) as of the data cutoff.
◦Eighty-five percent of patients (11 out of 13) with at least seven months of follow-up had not received a transfusion in more than seven months at time of data cutoff. These eleven patients previously required a median of 18.5 transfusions per year (ranging from 11.0 to 39.5 transfusions per year). In these patients, gene therapy-derived HbAT87Q supported total Hb levels ranging from 8.8 to 14.0 g/dL at last visit.
•Safety results from Northstar-2 (HGB-207) and Northstar-3 (HGB-212) studies: Non-serious adverse events (AEs) observed during the HGB-207 and HGB-212 trials that were considered related or possibly related to beti-cel were tachycardia, abdominal pain, pain in extremities, leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. One serious adverse event of thrombocytopenia was considered possibly related to beti-cel. In HGB-207, serious events post-infusion in more than two patients included three events of veno-occlusive liver disease and two events of thrombocytopenia. In HGB-212, serious events post-infusion in more than two patients included two events of pyrexia. Additional adverse events observed in clinical studies were consistent with the known side effects of HSC collection and bone marrow ablation with busulfan, including serious adverse events of veno-occlusive disease. In both Phase 3 studies, there have been no deaths, no graft failure, no cases of vector-mediated replication competent lentivirus or clonal dominance, no leukemia and no lymphoma as of the data cut-off date.
In addition, we have conducted the following clinical studies of beti-cel:
•The Northstar study (HGB-204) is a completed, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States, Australia and Thailand to evaluate the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in increasing hemoglobin production and eliminating or reducing transfusion dependence following treatment. This study was completed in February 2018, and patients in this study were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol to assess safety and efficacy beyond the Northstar study follow-up period. Eighteen adults and adolescents were treated in the study. To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients were between 12 and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT and received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs or at least eight transfusions per year in each of the two years preceding enrollment. The patients were also medically eligible for allogeneic HSCT. Efficacy was evaluated primarily by the production of ≥2.0 g/dL of hemoglobin A containing βA-T87Q-globin for the six-month period between 18 and 24 months post-treatment. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included RBC transfusion requirements per month and per year, post-treatment. Safety evaluations performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Subjects were monitored by regular screening. Each patient remained on study for approximately 24 months from time of consent and then were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that is assessing safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.
•The HGB-205 study is a completed, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical study at a single site in France to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in four patients with TDT and of LentiGlobin for SCD in three patients with SCD. Patients were required to be between five and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT or SCD at the time of enrollment. To be enrolled, patients with TDT must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of RBCs per year for the past two years. Those with SCD must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea and have an additional poor prognostic risk factor (e.g., recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, or VOCs, or acute chest sydrome, or ACS). All patients must have been eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched sibling allogeneic HSCT donor. The primary objective of our HGB-205 study was to determine the safety, tolerability and success of engraftment of beti-cel/ LentiGlobin for SCD. The secondary objectives of the study were to quantify gene transfer efficiency and expression, and to measure the effects of treatment with beti-cel/ LentiGlobin for SCD on disease-specific biological parameters and clinical events. In the case of patients with TDT and SCD, this meant the volume of RBC transfusions, and for patients with SCD, it also meant the number of VOCs and ACS in each patient, compared with the two-year period prior to treatment. Safety evaluations to be performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient and characterization of events of clonal dominance or leukemia/ lymphoma.
As described above, patients participating in and completing the two years of follow up in either of the Phase 1/2 studies (HGB-204 and HGB-205) or the Phase 3 studies (HGB-207 and HGB-212) were invited to enroll in the 13-year long-term follow-up study LTF-303. In December 2020, we presented updated clinical data from LTF-303 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date as of March 3, 2020:
◦Thirty-two patients were enrolled in LTF-303 (22 treated in Phase 1/2 studies, ten treated in Phase 3 studies) with a median post-infusion follow-up of 49.1 months (ranging from 23.3 to 71.8 months). Of the 32 patients enrolled in LTF-303, transfusion independence was achieved in 64 percent of patients (14 out of 22) treated in Phase 1/2 and in 90 percent of patients (nine out of ten) treated in Phase 3. All patients who achieved transfusion independence remained free from transfusions. The median duration of ongoing transfusion independence was 39.4 months (ranging from 19.4 to 69.4 months). Weighted average Hb in patients who achieved transfusion independence in the Phase 1/2 studies was 10.4 g/dL (ranging from 9.4 to 13.3 g/dL) and 12.5 g/dL (ranging from 11.9 to 13.5 g/dL) in patients who achieved transfusion independence in the Phase 3 studies.
◦Median gene therapy-derived hemoglobin (HbAT87Q) in all patients treated in the Phase 1/2 studies was stable over time: with a median of 6.4 g/dL (ranging from 0.5 to 10.1 g/dL) in 22 patients at Month 24, a median of 6.7 g/dL (ranging from 0.4 to 10.1 g/dL) in 22 patients at Month 36, a median of 6.6 g/dL (ranging from 0.5 to 10.7 g/dL) in 22 patients at Month 48, and a median of 7.1 g/dL (ranging from 2.8 to 11.2 g/dL) in ten patients at Month 60. Median HbAT87Q at Month 24 in all ten patients treated in the Phase 3 studies was 9.5 g/dL (ranging from 0.9 to 12.4 g/dL).
◦Following an initial increase in liver iron concentration (LIC) after infusion, LIC in patients who achieved transfusion independence decreased, particularly in patients with a high iron burden at baseline. Two patients with severe iron burden (LIC >15 mg/g) and the five patients with significant iron burden (LIC ≥7 – 15 mg/g) at baseline had a median reduction of 59% and 38%, respectively, from baseline to Month 48.
◦Prior to beti-cel infusion, all patients were on iron chelation, which is needed to reduce excess iron caused by chronic blood transfusions. Fifteen of the 23 patients (65%) who achieved transfusion independence following treatment with beti-cel discontinued iron chelation. Seven of the 23 (30%) were able to receive phlebotomy (blood removal), which is a preferred method for iron reduction.
◦No cases of death, graft-versus-host disease, and replication-competent lentivirus, clonal dominance or leukemia/ lymphoma were observed as of data cut-off. No drug-related adverse events were reported >2 years post-infusion. Serious adverse events during LTF-303 unrelated to beti-cel included gonadotropic insufficiency, ectopic pregnancy, gall bladder wall thickening/polyp, bacteremia, neutropenia and major depression (with one case of each).
LentiGlobin for Sickle Cell Disease
We are developing LentiGlobin for SCD as a one-time treatment for patients with SCD, a hereditary blood disorder resulting from a mutation in the β-globin gene that causes polymerization of hemoglobin proteins, resulting in abnormal red blood cell function. The disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive events (or VOEs, repeated acute painful episodes of vaso-occlusion due to sickle cell crises, acute chest syndrome, priapism, or chronic organ damage), cumulative damage to multiple organs, infections, stroke, overall poor quality of life and early death in a large subset of patients. As in our approach with beti-cel in TDT, our approach in SCD involves the ex vivo insertion of the normal β-globin gene with the T87Q amino acid substitution using a lentiviral vector into the patient’s own HSCs to enable formation of normally functioning hemoglobin A and normal RBCs in patients. In LentiGlobin for SCD, T87Q serves as a distinct biomarker used to quantify expression levels of the functional β-globin protein in patients with SCD, while also providing anti-sickling properties. We refer to the cells that have undergone our ex vivo manufacturing process resulting in genetically modified HSCs as LentiGlobin for SCD. 
Based on our prior discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek accelerated approval for LentiGlobin for SCD in the United States on the basis of clinical data from Group C of our HGB-206 clinical study, with our HGB-210 clinical study providing confirmatory data for full approval. However, in light of a SUSAR of acute myeloid leukemia and a SUSAR of myelodysplastic syndrome in our HGB-206 clinical study reported to us in February 2021, the FDA has placed our clinical studies of LentiGlobin for SCD on clinical hold. We are investigating these events and plan to continue to work closely with the FDA in their review of these events. In addition, we are also engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for LentiGlobin for SCD in Europe. LentiGlobin for SCD has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA and Fast-Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of certain patients with SCD. The FDA has also granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation to LentiGlobin for SCD.
We are conducting, or have conducted, the following clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin for SCD in the treatment of patients with SCD:
•The HGB-206 study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin for SCD. Approximately fifty adult and adolescent patients are enrolled in the study. Patients must be at least twelve years of age with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with βS/βS, βS/β+ or βS/β0 genotype. The sickle cell disease must be severe, as defined by recurrent severe VOEs, and patients must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. We refer to the 32 patients treated under the amended study protocol utilizing HSCs from peripheral blood after mobilization with plerixafor as patients in “Group C.” The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is complete resolution of severe VOEs, between six and 18 months post-treatment, and the secondary efficacy endpoint for this study is globin response based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin. Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.

In December 2020, we presented updated clinical data from our HGB-206 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized below are as of the data cut-off date as of August 20, 2020:
◦A total of 32 patients were treated with LentiGlobin for SCD gene therapy in Group C of HGB-206 and had up to 30.9 months of follow-up with a median of 13.0 months (ranging from 1.1 to 30.9 months).
◦In the 22 patients with six or more months of follow-up whose hemoglobin fractions were available, median levels of gene therapy-derived anti-sickling hemoglobin, HbAT87Q, were maintained with HbAT87Q contributing at least 40% of total hemoglobin at Month 6. Total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q ranged from 9.6 to 15.1 g/dL and 2.7 to 8.9 g/dL, respectively. 
◦At Month 6, the production of HbAT87Q was associated with a reduction in the proportion of HbS in total hemoglobin; median HbS was 50% and remained less than 60% at all follow-up timepoints. All patients in Group C were able to stop regular blood transfusions by three months post-treatment and remain off transfusions as of the data cut-off.
◦Nineteen patients treated in Group C had a history of severe VOEs, defined as at least four severe VOEs in the 24 months prior to informed consent (annualized rate of severe VOE ranging from 2.0 to10.5 events) and at least six months follow-up after treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD. There have been no reports of severe VOEs in these Group C patients following treatment with LentiGlobin for SCD. In addition, all 19 patients had a complete resolution of VOEs after Month 6.
◦The safety data from Group C patients in HGB-206 remain generally consistent with the known side effects of HSC collection and myeloablative single-agent busulfan conditioning, as well as underlying SCD. One non-serious, Grade 2 adverse event (AE) of febrile neutropenia was considered related to LentiGlobin for SCD. There were no serious AEs related to LentiGlobin for SCD. One patient with significant baseline SCD-related and cardiopulmonary disease died 20 months post-treatment; the treating physician and an independent monitoring committee agreed his death was unlikely related to LentiGlobin for SCD and that SCD-related cardiac and pulmonary disease contributed.
•HGB-210 is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site, international phase 3 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LentiGlobin for SCD in the treatment of patients with SCD and a history of vaso-occlusive events, or VOEs, with a target enrollment of 35 pediatric, adolescent and adult patients. Patients must be at least two years of age at enrollment with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with βS/βS, βS/β+ or βS/β0 genotype. The sickle cell disease must be severe, as defined by recurrent severe VOEs, and patients must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. The patients must also be eligible for HSCT. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is globin response based on βA-T87Q expression and total hemoglobin, and the secondary efficacy endpoint for this study is 75% reduction in annualized severe VOEs. Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any patient; and the characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Each patient will remain on study for approximately 24 months post-treatment and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the study protocol’s follow-up period.
•HGB-205 is a completed single-center phase 1/2 study in France of patients with SCD which also enrolled patients with TDT. 
Elivaldogene autotemcel
We are developing eli-cel as a one-time treatment for CALD, the most severe form of adrenololeukodystrophy, a rare X-linked metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which results in accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in plasma and tissues, leading to a range of clinical outcomes. CALD involves a progressive destruction of myelin, the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for thinking and muscle control. Symptoms of CALD usually occur in early childhood and progress rapidly if untreated, leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death in most patients. Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene via a lentiviral vector into the patient’s own HSCs. Following engraftment, we expect the transduced HSCs to differentiate into other cell types, including macrophages and cerebral microglia, which produce functional ALDP. We believe that the functional ALDP can then enable the local degradation of VLCFAs in the brain, which in turn can stabilize the disease by preventing further cerebral inflammation and demyelination that are characteristics of CALD.
In October 2020, the EMA accepted our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD on the basis of safety and efficacy data from our ongoing Starbeam study, safety data from our ongoing ALD-104 study, and the completed ALD-103 observational study. For the assessment of efficacy, we expect that the clinical results of the Starbeam study will be compared to a clinically meaningful benchmark based on the medical literature 
and data collected in ALD-101, a retrospective analysis that assessed the natural history of CALD, as well as outcomes of patients with CALD who had received allogeneic HSCT. For the assessment of safety, we expect that the clinical results of the Starbeam study will be compared to data collected from the ALD-103 study, a multinational, multi-site, prospective and retrospective observational study designed to evaluate outcomes of allogeneic HSCT in patients with CALD. We currently expect to submit the BLA for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD in mid-2021. Eli-cel has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA for adrenoleukodystrophy. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and the EMA has granted PRIME eligibility to eli-cel.
We are conducting the following studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eli-cel in the treatment of patients with CALD: 
•The Starbeam study (ALD-102) is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eli-cel in males with CALD ≤ 17 years of age. Thirty-two patients have been enrolled in this study. Key inclusion criteria included: male and, at time of enrollment, ≤ 17 years of age and with a neurologic function score (NFS) of ≤ 1, with active CALD as defined by elevated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) levels, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating Loes score between 0.5 and ≤ 9 (inclusive) and evidence of gadolinium enhancement (GdE+). Patients with a willing, unaffected 10/10 HLA-matched sibling HSC donor were excluded from the study. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who are alive and free of six major functional disabilities, or MFD, at 24 months post-treatment.  MFDs were defined as loss of communication, complete loss of voluntary movement, cortical blindness, tube feeding, wheelchair dependence, and total incontinence. These six MFDs were selected as they are considered to have the most significant impact on the ability of patients with CALD to function independently, representing unambiguous and profound neurologic degeneration. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included monitoring over time of the following: NFS, a 25-point scale used to evaluate the severity of gross neurologic dysfunction by scoring 15 neurological abnormalities across multiple domains; Loes score, a 34-pont scale designed to objectively measure the extent of demyelination and atrophy in CALD patients, based on brain magnetic resonance imagining, or MRI, studies; and gadolinium enhancement status, associated with inflammation and disruption of the blood brain barrier on brain MRI. 
The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of patients who experience either ≥ Grade 2 acute GVHD or chronic GVHD by 2 years post-treatment. Some additional safety evaluations include the following: success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality; detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus; and characterization and quantification of events related to the location of insertion of the functional ABCD1 gene in target cells. Patients will be followed for 24 months post-treatment under this protocol. In accordance with applicable guidance from the FDA and EMA, we will be monitoring patients in a separate long-term follow up protocol (LTF-304) to evaluate safety for up to 15 years, and will also monitor efficacy endpoints to demonstrate a sustained treatment effect.
In August 2020, we presented updated clinical data at the 46th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). All data presented and summarized below are as of January 2020, except as otherwise indicated:
◦The data reflect a total patient population of 32 patients in the study, with a median follow-up time of 30.0 months and a range of 9.1 to 70.7 months. Of the 32 patients who have received eli-cel, 20 had completed ALD-102 and were enrolled in LTF-304, while nine continued to be followed in ALD-102 not having reached 24 months post-treatment, and three were no longer on-study. Of the three patients who are no longer on the study, two withdrew from the study at investigator discretion, and one experienced rapid disease progression early in the study, resulting in MFDs and death. 
◦Of the 23 patients who have or would have reached 24 months of follow-up and completed the study, 87 percent (20 out of 23) have met the primary endpoint and continue to be alive and MFD-free in LTF-304. Fourteen patients have at least four years of follow-up, including ten patients who have reached at least their Year 5 follow-up visit. The nine patients from ALD-102 that have not reached Month 24 have shown no evidence of MFDs.
◦Of the 32 patients who have received eli-cel, 31 had stable NFS (NFS ≤ 4, without a change of >3 from baseline) and 24 patients maintained an NFS of 0 following treatment.
◦As of the data cut-off date, no acute or chronic GvHD have been reported post- treatment and there have been no reports of graft failure or graft rejection. The treatment regimen, comprising mobilization/apheresis, conditioning, and eli-cel infusion, had a safety and tolerability profile primarily reflective of the known effects of mobilization/apheresis and conditioning. In ALD-102, as previously reported, three adverse events were considered possibly related to eli-cel and include one serious adverse event (Grade 3 BK viral cystitis), 
and two non-serious adverse events (Grade 1 vomiting). All three adverse events resolved using standard measures.
◦There have been no cases of replication competent lentivirus or insertional oncogenesis as of the data-cutoff date. Integration site analysis was conducted to determine the pattern of proviral integration post-eli-cel treatment and assess whether dominant or expanding clones were present. In one patient, now enrolled in LTF-304 for long-term follow up, a case of benign clonal expansion was observed with three separate integrations in the DNA of the cell at ACER3, RFX3, and MECOM. As of the patient’s Month 62 visit in March 2020, the patient remained clinically stable. Bone marrow analyses showed no dysplasia (abnormal cell growth) or molecular abnormalities.
•The ALD-104 study is an open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eli-cel in males with CALD ≤ 17 years of age after myeloablative conditioning using busulfan and fludarabine, a different chemotherapy conditioning regimen than what is used in ALD-102 (busulfan and cyclophosphamide). Target enrollment in ALD-104 is 35 patients. Key inclusion criteria included: male and, at time of enrollment, ≤ 17 years of age and with a neurolgoci function score (NFS) of ≤ 1, with active CALD as defined by elevated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) levels, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating Loes score between 0.5 and ≤ 9 (inclusive) and evidence of gadolinium enhancement (GdE+). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who are alive and free of six MFDs at 24 months post-treatment. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included monitoring over time of the following: NFS, Loes score, and gadolinium enhancement status, associated with inflammation and disruption of the blood brain barrier on brain MRIThe primary safety endpoint is the proportion of patients with neutrophil engraftment after eli-cel infusion (time frame: 42 days post drug-product infusion).
In August 2020, we presented updated clinical data at the 46th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). All data presented and summarized below are as of February 2020:
◦13 patients were on study with a median of 6.1 months of follow-up (ranging from 2.2 to 10.3 months). All 13 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment and 12 out of 13 evaluable patients had platelet engraftment (platelet engraftment pending in one patient as of data cut date). 
◦No events of acute or chronic GvHD had been reported and there have been no reports of graft failure, graft rejection, cases of insertional oncogenesis, or replication competent lentivirus.
◦The treatment regimen, comprising mobilization/apheresis, conditioning, and eli-cel infusion had a safety and tolerability profile primarily reflective of the known effects of mobilization/apheresis and conditioning. Two adverse events of pancytopenia were considered possibly related to eli-cel. These two ongoing adverse events were deemed as suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions by the principal investigator and were diagnosed approximately two months post-eli-cel treatment in two patients (one Grade 2 and one Grade 3). An additional serious adverse event was ongoing as of February 2020, a Grade 3 transverse myelitis that was diagnosed in the presence of viral infection (adenovirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus positivity) approximately six months after eli-cel treatment and deemed unrelated to eli-cel.
•The ALD-103 study is a completed observational prospective/ partially retrospective data collection study of 59 patients with CALD ≤17 years of age who received allogeneic HSCT. This study was designed to collect efficacy and safety outcomes data in patients who had undergone allogeneic HSCT in a period that is contemporaneous with the Starbeam study. The study measured CALD disease-related outcomes in four patient cohorts: early disease 1 (N=21; Loes ≤4 and NFS ≤1); early disease 2 (N=9; Loes >4 to 9 and NFS ≤1); all early disease (N=30; Loes ≤9 and NFS ≤1); and advanced disease (N=10; Loes >9 or NFS >1). Transplant-related outcomes were assessed by donor stem cell source, by donor match, and by conditioning regimen. We anticipate that eli-cel safety and efficacy will be evaluated by the FDA and EMA in light of the data collected in the Starbeam study in conjunction with our retrospective observational ALD-101 study and our retrospective and prospective observational ALD-103 study, as well as safety results from our ongoing ALD-104 study.
Strategic collaborations in severe genetic disease 
We have formed and intend to seek other opportunities to form strategic collaborations with third parties who can augment our industry-leading gene therapy platform and expertise, and to access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products. To date, we have focused on forging a limited number of significant strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies and academic research centers where both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential product candidates. Currently, our strategic collaborations in severe genetic disease include those with: 
•Magenta Therapeutics, Inc., to evaluate the utility of MGTA-145 in combination with plerixafor for mobilization and collection of stem cells in adults and adolescents with SCD, through a proof-of-concept clinical trial;
•Novo Nordisk A/S, to jointly develop next-generation in vivo genome editing treatments for genetic diseases, including hemophilia; and
•Forty Seven, Inc., a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc., to pursue clinical proof-of-concept for an antibody-based conditioning regimen in combination with our ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy platform.
Manufacturing in severe genetic disease 
We have entered into multi-year agreements with external manufacturing partners in the United States and Europe to support our clinical and commercial programs in severe genetic disease. We have multi-year agreements with SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., or SAFC (a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma), and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (previously Novasep) in the production of lentiviral vector. In addition, we have entered into multi-year agreements with Lonza Houston, Inc. and Minaris Regenerative Medicine, or Minaris, to produce drug product. Currently to support the commercialization of beti-cel in Europe, SAFC is our sole manufacturer of lentiviral vector, and Minaris is our sole manufacturer of drug product. In our manufacturing agreement with SAFC, we are required to provide rolling forecasts for products on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order, subject to a purchase commitment. In our manufacturing agreement with Minaris, we reserve production capacity for the manufacture of our drug product. In addition, we rely on specialized third-party testing organizations to confirm the quality of vector and drug product prior to their use in clinical trials and in the commercial context. 
We believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to effectively oversee these contract manufacturing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions and commercialization efforts. For the treatment of patients with our drug product in the commercial setting, we are partnering with participating apheresis centers, which we refer to as qualified treatment centers, to be centers for collection of HSCs from the patient and for infusion of drug product to the patient.
Commercial operations 
We are commercializing ZYNTEGLO in the European Union and the United Kingdom, following our receipt of conditional marketing approval by the European Commission in June 2019. In February 2021, we temporarily suspended marketing of ZYNTEGLO and the EMA has paused the renewal procedure for ZYNTEGLO's conditional marketing authorization while the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee reviews the risk-benefit assessment for ZYNTEGLO and determines whether any additional pharmacovigilance measures are necessary. As we transition into a commercial-stage company, we have established commercial operations in Europe, and have begun to build commercial operations in the United States, with a goal of delivering our gene therapies, if and once approved, to patients through qualified treatment centers. In the course of preparing to treat our first commercial patients, we have established commercial capabilities across the European Union, and in the United States and United Kingdom by adding employees with broad experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. Our commercialization activities include active engagement with stakeholders across the healthcare system, including those with public and private payers, patient advocates and organizations, professional societies, and healthcare providers, to explore new payment models that we hope will enable access for more patients. Ultimately, we intend to leverage our commercial infrastructure to support the potential for multiple product launches sequentially across multiple geographies. For many territories and countries, we may also elect to utilize strategic collaborators, including distributors, or contract field-based teams to assist in the commercialization of our product and potential future products.
While we have largely established the appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure necessary for supporting our complex supply chain and commercialization activities, we expect that we may make additional targeted investments as we continue our efforts in adding sites to our network of qualified treatment centers, establishing patient-focused programs, educating healthcare professionals, and securing reimbursement. 
The timing and conduct of our commercialization activities will be dependent upon regulatory interactions, marketing approvals received for our product and potential future products, and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. 
Our Programs in Oncology 
We are pursuing multiple programs that leverage the unique properties of lentiviral vectors to target T cells as a therapy for various cancers. This represents a direct application of our expertise in gene therapy and our capabilities, know-how and patents associated with lentiviral gene therapy and gene editing for ex vivo applications. Our oncology programs use a customized 
lentiviral vector to alter T cells, rather than HSCs, so that the T cells can recognize specific proteins or protein fragments on the surface of cancer cells in order to kill these diseased cells.  T cells that have been genetically-engineered ex vivo to make CAR or TCRs are designed to help a patient’s immune system overcome survival mechanisms employed by cancer cells. CAR T cell technology directs T cells to recognize cancer cells based on expression of specific cell surface antigens, whereas TCR T cell technology provides the T cells with a specific T cell receptor that recognizes protein fragments derived from either intracellular or extracellular proteins which are displayed on the tumor cell surface. The genetically-engineered T cells are designed to supplement a patient’s immune system and may be further engineered to overcome immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells. For instance, we are exploring applications of our CAR and TCR T cell technologies in combination with novel proteins based on synthetic biology. These technologies may potentially allow our future T cell-based product candidates to detect the tumor microenvironment or to be regulated by small molecules. In addition, using our gene editing technology, we potentially have a number of additional options to manipulate the genome of the cancer patient’s T cells to further increase the specificity of the anti-tumor activity and to potentially make these cells even more potent. All of the gene-editing technologies currently being explored by the pharmaceutical industry, including zinc finger nucleases, CRISPR/Cas9, and TALENs, share common features of a DNA binding domain and a DNA cleavage domain.  They differ in specificity, size, ease of delivery and as naturally occurring versus engineered nucleases.  Our gene editing platform is based on homing endonucleases and megaTALs, based on a naturally-occurring class of DNA cleaving enzymes that function as monomeric proteins able to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and cleave their target site. We believe there are multiple advantages of homing endonucleases and megaTALs compared to other gene editing technologies, most notably: they are highly specific and efficient in cutting DNA and their compact size simplifies delivery to therapeutically relevant cell types.  We are using our gene editing platform, along with collaborations with multiple academic institutions, to potentially discover and develop next-generation gene therapy and oncology product candidates.
Our programs in oncology include ide-cel and bb21217 in multiple myeloma, which we are developing in collaboration with BMS, and preclinical programs to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat other hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (in collaboration with Seattle Children's Research Institute), MAGE-A4 positive solid tumors (in collaboration with Regeneron), and Merkel cell carcinoma (in collaboration with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). We are also independently researching and developing other CAR T cell product candidates against a variety of cancer targets, including next-generation anti-BCMA CAR-T cell products for the treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Ide-cel and bb21217
In collaboration with BMS, we are developing ide-cel and bb21217, with the goal of filing for regulatory approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma on a global basis.  Ide-cel and bb21217 both bind to BCMA, a cell surface protein expressed on normal plasma cells, some mature B cells, and on malignant multiple myeloma cells, but not on other cells. Ide-cel and bb21217 arose from our multi-year collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, which was acquired by BMS in November 2019. We co-develop and co-commercialize ide-cel in the United States with BMS, in which we share equally in costs and any profits. BMS has the exclusive license to develop and commercialize ide-cel outside of the United States. BMS has the exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize bb21217, and we retain an option to co-develop and co-commercialize this product candidate in the United States. The terms of our arrangements with BMS are described more fully below under “Strategic collaborations in oncology—Our strategic alliance with BMS.” 
In September 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review the BLA submitted by BMS for ide-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Drug status to both ide-cel and bb21217 for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.  The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and the EMA has granted PRIME eligibility to ide-cel for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. 
For the development of ide-cel, BMS is conducting, or is planning to conduct, the following clinical studies in multiple myeloma:
•The KarMMa study, a pivotal open-label, single arm, multicenter, phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in North America and Europe. All enrolled patients had received at least three prior regimens, including an immunomodulatory (IMiD) agent, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an anti-CD38 antibody, and all were refractory to their last regimen, defined as progression during or within 60 days of their last therapy. Ninety-four percent of patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody and 84% percent were triple refractory (refractory to an IMiD agent, PI and anti-CD38 antibody).
The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Complete response rate (CR) is the key secondary endpoint. Other efficacy endpoints include time to response, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival and minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluated by next-generation sequencing assay. The study enrolled 140 patients, of whom 128 patients were treated with ide-cel across the target dose levels of 
150-450 x 106 CAR+ T cells after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy. In May 2020, we and BMS presented the results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 Virtual Scientific Program, as summarized below:
◦128 patients were treated with ide-cel across target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. Patients had a median of six prior regimens; 84% were refractory to all three classes of commonly used treatments including an IMiD, a PI and an anti-CD38 antibody, and 94% were refractory to anti-CD38 antibodies. Median duration of follow-up was 13.3 months.
◦Results for the primary endpoint (ORR) and key secondary endpoint (CR), as well as median duration of response (DoR) and median progression-free survival (PFS) across the target dose levels and at each of the three target doses explored in the study were as follows:

CAR+ T cell dose level | 150 x 106 | 300 x 106 | 450 x 106 | 150-450 x 106
N | 4 | 70 | 54 | 128 
Measures: | | | | 
Overall response rate, n (%) | 2 (50) | 48 (69) | 44 (82) | 94 (73) 
Complete response (CR)/ Stringent CR, n (%) | 1 (25) | 20 (29) | 21 (39) | 42 (33) 
Median DoR, months | † | 9.9 | 11.3 | 10.7 
Median DoR by best response (CR/sCR), months | † | †† | †† | 19.0 
Median PFS, months | 2.8 | 5.8 | 12.1 | 8.8 
Median PFS by best response (CR/sCR), months | † | †† | †† | 20.2 
†Not reported due to small n 
††Data not reported 

◦The overall response rate (ORR) was 73% across all dose levels, including 33% of patients who had a complete response (CR) or stringent CR (sCR). Median duration of response (DoR) was 10.7 months, with 19.0 month median DoR for patients who had a CR or sCR. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.8 months, with 20.2 month median PFS for patients who had a CR or sCR. All patients who had CR or sCR and were evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD), were MRD-negative. Clinically meaningful benefit was consistently observed across subgroups, and nearly all subgroups had an ORR of 50% or greater, including older and high-risk patients. The overall survival (OS) data continue to mature, with an estimated median OS of 19.4 months across all dose levels and 78% of patients alive at 12 months. Results support a favorable benefit-risk profile for ide-cel across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells.
◦The most frequently reported adverse events were cytopenia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Cytopenias were common and not dose related. Overall, CRS of any grade was reported in 84% (107/128) of patients. Grade 3 or higher CRS occurred in <6% (7/128) of patients, with one fatal CRS event. Investigator identified neurotoxicity events (iiNT) were reported in 18% (23/128) of patients, including Grade 3 iiNT reported in 3% (4/128) of patients. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 iiNT events reported.
•The CRB-401 study, a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site phase 1 dose escalation/ dose expansion clinical study in the United States to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in up to 67 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In order to be eligible for CRB-401, patients must have received three prior regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI; bortezomib or carfilzomib) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD; lenalidomide or pomalidomide), or be “double-refractory” to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.  In the expansion cohort, patients must have received at least a PI, an IMiD and daratumumab, and be refractory to their last line of therapy. Patients receive one cycle of lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine prior to infusion of the bb2121 drug product. 
The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory test results, including dose-limiting toxicities. The study also seeks to assess disease-specific response including: complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The study also seeks to determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended dose for further clinical trials. Each patient is followed for up to 60 months post-treatment, and then is enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the 60-month period.

In December 2020, we presented updated results from the CRB-401 study at the ASH Annual Meeting as summarized below:
◦62 patients were treated with ide-cel across dose levels of 50, 150, 450, or 800 × 106 CAR positive T cells. Among the 62 patients treated with ide-cel in this study, the overall response rate (ORR) was 76%, including 24 patients (39%) who achieved a complete response (CR). The median duration of response (DoR) was 10.3 months. Median PFS was 8.8 months and median OS was 34.2 months, with a median follow-up of 14.7 months. 
◦Safety remained consistent with previously reported results from CRB-401. Among all infused patients , the most frequent adverse events were neutropenia (92%), cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 76%), anemia (76%), and thrombocytopenia (74%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (89%), leukopenia (61%), anemia (57%), and thrombocytopenia (57%). Most CRS events were Grade 1 or 2. Four patients (7%) had Grade 3 CRS; there were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS events reported.
•the KarMMa-2 study, an open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center phase 2 study of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in high-risk multiple myeloma. 
•the KarMMa-3 study, an open-label, randomized, multi-center, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of ide-cel versus standard triplet regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. 
•the KarMMa-4 study, an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1 study intended to determine the optimal target dose and safety of ide-cel in patients with high-risk newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
For the development of the bb21217 product candidate, we are conducting the CRB-402 study, a single-dose, open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1 dose escalation/ dose expansion clinical study in the United States to examine the safety and efficacy of our bb21217 product candidate in up to 74 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In order to be eligible for CRB-402, patients must have received three prior regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI: bortezomib or carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory agent (IMiD: lenalidomide or pomalidomide), or be “double-refractory” to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.  In the expansion cohort, patients must have received at least a PI, and IMiD and daratumumab, and be refractory to their last line of therapy. Patients receive one cycle of lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine prior to infusion of the bb21217 drug product. 
The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory test results, including dose-limiting toxicities.

Each patient will be followed for up to 60 months post-treatment, and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond the 60-month period.
In December 2020, we presented updated clinical data from the CRB-402 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. All data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and summarized here are as of the data cut-off date of September 1, 2020. Sixty-nine patients received treatment as of the data cut-off. Patients had a median of six prior lines of therapy and 78 percent of patients received at least one prior autologous stem cell transplant. 

CAR+ T cell dose level | 150 x 106 (n=12) | 300 x 106 (n=14) | 450 x 106 (n=43) | 150-450 x 106 (n=69)

CAR-T cell persistence was observed in 27 of 30 patients with ongoing response and evaluable at three months, 20 of 23 patients with ongoing response and evaluable at six months, six of eleven patients with ongoing response and evaluable at twelve months, three of six patients with ongoing response and evaluable at 18 months, and two of two patients with ongoing response and evaluable at 24 months.
The adverse events observed with bb21217 were consistent with known toxicities of BCMA CAR T-cell therapies, with low rates of Grade ≥3 CRS and neurotoxicity. Of the 69 patients, 48 patients developed bb21217-related CRS: 45 with Grade 1/2, one with Grade 3, and two with Grade 5 (death). Eleven of 69 (16%) patients developed neurotoxicity; eight Grade 1/2, two Grade 3 (one with vertigo/dizziness and one with encephalopathy), and one Grade 4 (encephalopathy). One additional death occurred from infection within 6 months in the absence of MM progression. Cytopenias were common and not dose related. Grade ≥3 infections were reported in 26 % of patients (18 of 69).
Strategic collaborations in oncology
We have formed and intend to seek other opportunities to form strategic collaborations with third parties who can augment our T cell immunotherapy, lentiviral vector and gene-editing expertise, and to access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize T cell immunotherapy products. To date, we have focused on forging a limited number of significant strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies and academic research centers where both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential product candidates. Currently, our strategic collaborations in oncology include relationships with: 
•BMS, in the development of ide-cel and bb21217 product candidates in multiple myeloma;
•Regeneron, in the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel cell therapies for cancer;
•Medigene AG, to discover TCR product candidates in the field of cancer; and
•Gritstone Oncology, Inc., to validate targets and discover TCR product candidates in the field of cancer.
We also have academic collaborations at various stages or research and preclinical development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, University of North Carolina, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. 
Our collaboration with BMS
In March 2013, we began a strategic collaboration with Celgene, now BMS, to discover, develop and commercialize chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells, or CAR T cells, as potentially disease-altering gene therapies in oncology, which was amended and restated in June 2015, and amended again in February 2016 and in September 2017. The multi-year research and development collaboration focused on applying our expertise in gene therapy technology to CAR T cell-based therapies, to target and destroy cancer cells. The research collaboration term ended in June 2018, with ide-cel and bb21217 product candidates arising from the collaboration.
In February 2016, BMS exercised its option with respect to the ide-cel product candidate, and we exclusively licensed to BMS the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the ide-cel product candidate, while retaining an option to co-develop and co-promote the ide-cel product candidate in the United States. In connection with its exercise of its option to obtain an exclusive license, BMS paid to us an option fee in the amount of $10.0 million. In March 2018, we exercised our option to co-develop and co-promote the ide-cel product candidate in the United States. Under the terms of the co-development and co-promotion agreement that we have with BMS for the development and commercialization of ide-cel, we share equally in all costs relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing the product candidate within the United States and we would share equally in the United States profits. In 2019, BMS paid us a $10.0 million clinical milestone payment. 
In September 2017, BMS exercised its option with respect to the bb21217 product candidate, and we exclusively licensed to BMS the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the bb21217 product candidate, while retaining an option to co-develop and co-promote the bb21217 product candidate in the United States on terms substantially similar to the co-development and co-promotion arrangement for the ide-cel product candidate. In connection with its exercise of its option to obtain an exclusive license, BMS paid to us an option fee in the amount of $15.0 million. Under the terms of the license agreement with BMS for the exclusive rights to the development and commercialization of bb21217, we are and will be responsible for conducting and funding all research and development activities performed up through completion of the CRB-402 study. In 2019, the protocol was amended to enroll additional patients and BMS has agreed to reimburse us a specified amount for the additional patients. 
In May 2020, we amended the co-development and co-promotion agreement with respect to ide-cel and the license agreement with respect to bb21217. Under these amended agreements, BMS was relieved of its obligations to pay us future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ex-U.S. sales for each of ide-cel and bb21217 in exchange for an up-front, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of $200.0 million. In connection with these amendments, BMS assumed the contract manufacturing 
agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector. Over time, BMS is assuming responsibility for manufacturing ide-cel suspension lentiviral vector outside of the U.S., with bluebird responsible for manufacturing ide-cel suspension lentiviral vector in the United States. In addition, under these amended agreements, the parties are released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. In addition, if we do not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote the bb21217 product candidate in the United States, we are also eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in clinical milestone payments, up to $67.5 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $45.0 million in commercial milestone payments, as well as a percentage of net sales as a royalty in a range from the mid-single digits to low-teens. The royalties payable to us are subject to certain reductions, including for any royalty payments required to be made by BMS to acquire patent rights, with an aggregate minimum floor. BMS will assume certain development obligations and must report on their progress in achieving these milestones on a quarterly basis.
Our collaboration with BMS is governed by a joint governance committee, or JGC, formed by representatives from us and BMS. The JGC, among other activities, reviews and approves development and commercialization plans and budgets for activities in the United States. Either party may terminate the agreements upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BMS may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us. If the agreements are terminated, rights to product candidates in development at the time of such termination will be allocated to the parties through a mechanism included in the agreements. In addition, if BMS has the right to terminate any co-development and co-promotion agreement or license agreement for our breach, BMS may elect to continue such agreement however, any amounts payable by BMS to us under such agreement will be reduced.
Manufacturing in Oncology 
In November 2017, we purchased a partially completed manufacturing facility located in Durham, North Carolina for $11.5 million. We acquired this 125,000 square foot facility to provide manufacturing capacity for our lentiviral vectors in support of our current and planned gene and cell therapy product candidates. In March of 2019, we announced the official opening of this facility, of which a portion has been placed into service and the remainder is in the process of construction. We currently expect that it will begin to produce lentiviral vector in 2021 in support of our oncology programs, including for ide-cel commercialization, if and when approval is obtained. In addition, we have entered into multi-year agreements with external manufacturing partners in the United States and Europe to support our various preclinical and clinical programs in oncology.

As of January 31, 2021, we co-owned (with Cellectis SA) two issued U.S. patents, two corresponding foreign patent applications, and 17 corresponding foreign patents related to our gene editing platform. We expect composition of matter or method patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2034 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect the other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2034 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may 
otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License agreements
Inserm-Transfert
In May 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with Inserm-Transfert, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale, for use of certain patents and know-how related to the ABCD1 gene and corresponding protein, for use in the field of human ALD therapy. Inserm-Transfert is referred to herein as Inserm. The last patent in the Inserm licensed patent portfolio expired in February of 2016.  Inserm retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for educational, clinical and preclinical studies purposes.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include eli-cel, we will be obligated to pay Inserm a percentage of net sales as a royalty for the longer of the life of any patents covering the product or 10 years from first commercial sale. This royalty is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Inserm are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits.
We are required to use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and introduce them into the commercial market as soon as practical, consistent with our reasonable business practices and judgment in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We have assumed certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on an annual basis.
We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach or in the event the other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed with prejudice within 120 days after filing. In addition, Inserm may terminate the license agreement in the event that we cannot prove within 60 days of written notice from Inserm that we have been diligent in developing the licensed products and introducing them into the commercial market.
Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the patent rights covered by the agreement or 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The license grant ceases in connection with any such termination. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement expired in 2016.
Institut Pasteur
We have entered into a license with Institut Pasteur for certain patents relating to the use of DNA sequences, lentiviral vectors and recombinant cells in the field of ex vivo gene therapy and CAR T cell-based therapy in a range of indications, excluding vaccinations. This agreement was amended twice in 2012, again in 2013 and most recently in 2015. The Institut Pasteur licensed patent portfolio includes two U.S. patents. The issued patents have statutory expiration dates in 2022 and 2023. The license is exclusive for products containing human and non-human lentiviral vectors. Institut Pasteur retains the right, on behalf of itself, its licensees and research partners, to conduct research using the licensed intellectual property.
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For the first sublicense including a product targeting β-hemoglobinopathies (including β-thalassemia and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy), we must pay Institut Pasteur an additional payment of €3.0 million. If we receive any income (cash or non-cash) in connection with sublicenses for products targeting indications other than β-hemoglobinopathies (including β-thalassemia and SCD) or ALD (including CALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy ), we must pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of such income varying from low single digits if the sublicense also includes licenses to intellectual property controlled by us, and a percentage of sublicense income in the mid-range double digits if the sublicense does not include licenses to intellectual property controlled by us.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel, LentiGlobin for SCD, eli-cel, ide-cel and bb21217, we will be obligated to pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies depending on the indication of the product but in any event is in the low single digits. In addition, starting in 2016 we must make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which is creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. If the combined royalties we would be required to pay to Institut Pasteur and third parties is higher than a pre-specified percentage, we may ask Institut Pasteur to re-negotiate our royalty rates under this relationship.
We are required to use all reasonable commercial efforts (as compared to a company of similar size and scope) to develop and commercialize one or more products in the license field and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals in respect of, and market the products in license field, if any. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations. We must report on our progress towards achieving these milestones on an annual basis. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time by sending Institut Pasteur 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party’s substantial breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Institut Pasteur may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and not dismissed within 60 days.
Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the last licensed patents or five years after first market authorization of the first product, whichever occurs later. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain the right to manufacture, import, use and sell licensed products for a certain period of time post-termination. In addition, our ownership stake in certain jointly made improvements covered by the licensed patents would survive termination of the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in 2023.
Stanford University
In July 2002, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, referred to herein as Stanford, which we amended and restated in April 2012. Under this agreement, we are granted a license to use the HEK293T cell line for any commercial or non-commercial use for research, nonclinical and clinical development purpose and human and animal gene therapy products.
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For each such sublicense we grant, we must pay Stanford a fee (unless the sublicense is to a collaborating partner, contract manufacturer or contract research organization).
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel, LentiGlobin for SCD, eli-cel, ide-cel and bb21217, we will be obligated to pay Stanford a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies with net sales but in any event is in the low single digits and is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage which is less than one percent. Since April 2013, we have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments.
We may unilaterally terminate the agreement by giving Stanford 30 days’ written notice. Stanford may also terminate the license agreement if after 30 days of providing notice we are delinquent on any report or payment, are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize one or more licensed products, are in material breach of any provision or provide any false report. Termination of this agreement may require us to utilize different cell types for vector manufacturing, which could lead to delays.
Absent early termination, the license will expire in April 2037. We may elect to extend the term for an additional 25 years so long as we have a commercial product on the market at that time and we are in material compliance with the license agreement.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
In December 1996, we entered into an exclusive license with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referred to herein as MIT, for use of certain patents in any field. This license agreement was amended in December 2003, May 2004 and June 2011. The licensed patent portfolio includes at least 13 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date from in 2023. This license also has been amended to include a case jointly owned by MIT and us wherein we received the exclusive license to MIT’s rights in this case. MIT retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for noncommercial research purposes.
We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. In the event we sublicense the patent rights, we must pay MIT a percentage of all payments we receive from by the sublicensee. This percentage varies from mid-single digits to low double digits.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel and LentiGlobin for SCD, we will be obligated to pay MIT a percentage of net sales by us or our sublicensees as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one-percent. In addition, we make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which may be credited against the royalty payments.
We are required to use diligent efforts to market licensed products and to continue active, diligent development and marketing efforts for licensed products during the term of the agreement. We have assumed certain milestones with respect to raising capital investment and regulatory progress. We must report on our progress on achieving these milestones on an annual basis.
We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon six months’ notice to MIT. MIT may terminate the agreement if we cease to carry on our business, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment). In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain a right to complete manufacture of any licensed products in process and sell then-existing inventory. In addition, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license following such termination. With respect to jointly owned intellectual property, any termination would allow MIT to grant licenses to any third-party to such intellectual property, without our approval, unless a sublicensee was already in place, in which case, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license.
Research Development Foundation
In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license with RDF to use certain patents that involve lentiviral vectors. The RDF licensed patent portfolio includes at least 31 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date between 2021 and 2027. RDF retains the right, on behalf of itself and other nonprofit academic research institutions, to practice and use the licensed patents for any academic, non-clinical research and educational purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement.
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel, LentiGlobin for SCD, eli-cel, ide-cel and bb21217 , we are obligated to pay RDF a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced by half if during the following ten years from the first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends.
We are required to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts for a company of our size and resources to develop or commercialize one or more licensed products, including our first licensed product by 2016 and a second licensed product by 2018. These diligence efforts include minimum annual royalty payments to RDF, which are creditable against earned royalties otherwise due to RDF, and payments upon regulatory milestones.
RDF may terminate the agreement in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment) or in the event we become bankrupt, our business or assets or property are placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, we institute or suffer to be instituted any procedure in bankruptcy court for reorganization or rearrangement of our financial affairs, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if we or an affiliate or a sublicensee institutes any procedure challenging the validity or patentability of any patent or patent application within the licensed patents, the agreement will immediately terminate.
Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until its expiration upon the later of there being no more valid claims within the licensed patents or the expiration of our royalty obligations on licensed products that are subject to an earned royalty, if such earned royalty is based on the minimum 10-year royalty period described above. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, RDF will grant our sublicensees a direct license. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are in one U.S. patent currently expected to expire in 2027.
Biogen
In August 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which we co-exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of T cell-based products that target BCMA. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date between 2024 and 2032. Biogen retains the right to practice and use the licensed patents in the licensed field and territory.  We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include ide-cel and bb21217, we will be obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop one or more licensed products in the license field during the term of the agreement. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $24.0 million in the aggregate for each licensed product upon the achievement of these milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to Biogen. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party’s material breach upon notice and an opportunity for the breaching party to cure. Either party may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against the other party and are not dismissed within a specified period of time.  Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically 
terminate upon the expiration of all patent rights covered by the agreement or ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the Agreement are in a U.S. patent, currently expected to expire in 2032.
NIH
In August 2015, we entered into a license agreement with the NIH, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of T cell-based products that target BCMA. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date in 2033-2034. NIH retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement on behalf of the government of the United States. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. For each such sublicense we grant we must pay the NIH a fee. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include ide-cel and bb21217, we will be obligated to pay the NIH a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop one or more licensed products in the license field during the term of the agreement. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $9.7 million in the aggregate for a licensed product upon the achievement of these milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to the NIH. The NIH may terminate the license in the event of our material breach upon notice and following an opportunity for us to cure the material breach. The NIH may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and are not dismissed within a specified period of time.  Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the patent rights covered by the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the Agreement are currently expected to expire in 2034.
SIRION
In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with SIRION, pursuant to which we exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of manufacturing gene therapy products. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date in 2033. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include beti-cel and LentiGlobin for SCD, we will be obligated to pay SIRION a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop one or more licensed products in the license field during the term of the agreement, and we must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $13.4 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to SIRION. SIRION may terminate the license in the event of our material breach upon notice and following an opportunity for us to cure the material breach. SIRION may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and are not dismissed within a specified period of time. Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the patent rights covered by the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the Agreement are currently expected to expire in 2033.
Orchard Therapeutics Limited
In April 2017, we entered into a license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, or GSK, pursuant to which GSK non-exclusively licensed certain of our patent rights related to lentiviral vector technology to develop and commercialize gene therapies for Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy, two rare genetic diseases. Effective April 2018, this license agreement was assigned by GSK to Orchard Therapeutics Limited, or Orchard. Financial terms of the agreement included an upfront payment to us as well as potential development and regulatory milestone payments and low single digit royalties on net sales of covered products.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any 
treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. Depending on how successful these competitive efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, and our preclinical T cell-based cancer immunotherapy product candidates. These efforts include the following:
β-thalassemia — The current standard of care for the treatment of β-thalassemia in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions to address the patient’s anemia. In addition, such patients often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload associated with their chronic blood transfusions. Novartis and Chiesi, who provide the leading iron chelation therapies, are seeking to develop improvements to their product profile and accessibility. A number of different approaches are under investigation that seek to improve the current standard of care treatment options, including a protein that aims to improve red blood cell production and small molecule that aims to improve red blood cell metabolism. Reblozyl (luspatercept), a subcutaneously-delivered protein therapeutic marketed by Acceleron Pharma, Inc. and BMS that targets molecules in the TGF-β superfamily, has been approved in the United States for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and was recently approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia associated with beta-thalassemia. Additionally, Agios has announced that mitapivat, an oral pyruvate kinase receptor activator, will be entering phase 3 evaluations in 2H 2021. Some patients with β-thalassemia receive HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. In addition, there are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT, or the tolerability and safety of haploidentical HSCT, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. There are also several different groups developing gene therapy options for β-thalassemia. These include: CRISPR Therapeutics AG (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) is conducting an ongoing phase 1/2 study for its CTX-001, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer; Sangamo BioSciences Inc. (in collaboration with Bioverativ Inc., a Sanofi company) is investigating ST-400, using a zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene-editing approach currently in an ongoing phase 1/2 study; and the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (in collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics) is currently investigating its gene therapy in a phase 2 study of adults and pediatric patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia (TDT), though Orchard Therapeutics has announced that this program has been deprioritized as of May 2020.
Sickle cell disease — The current standard of care for the treatment of SCD in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions or hydroxyurea (a generic drug). In addition, patients treated with chronic blood transfusions often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload. We are aware of ongoing studies that continue to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in various populations. In addition, a limited number of patients with SCD receive allogeneic HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. There are a number of academic and industry-sponsored research and development programs to improve the tolerability and safety of allogeneic HSCT with less well-matched sources of donor cells, while increasing the availability of suitable donors. Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. received FDA approval for and have launched Endari (L-glutamine) for the treatment of SCD. In addition to the FDA approved hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization inhibitor (voxelotor, Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.) and the FDA / EMA approved antibody to p-selectin (crizanlizumab, Novartis), a number of different therapeutic approaches for the chronic treatment of SCD are under investigation targeting the various aspects of SCD pathophysiology, including: Pyruvate Kinase-R (PKR) activator, FT-4202, in a phase 1 study supported by Forma Therapeutics, a PDE9 inhibitor, IMR-687, in a phase 2 study supported by IMARA Inc., a pyruvate kinase receptor activator, mitapivat, in a phase 1 study supported by Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. There are also several different groups developing gene therapy options for Sickle Cell Disease. These include: CRISPR Therapeutics AG’s (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) ongoing phase 1/2 study for its CTX-001, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform to disrupt the BCL11A erythroid enhancer, Aruvant Sciences, Inc.’s 
ongoing phase 1/2 study for its ARU-1801, which leverages a lentiviral vector encoding γ-globin,, Editas Medicine, Inc.’s ongoing phase 1/2 study for its EDIT-301, which leverages the CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing platform to target the HBG1/2 promoter to upregulate HbF, and Graphite Bio’s ongoing phase 1/2 study for its GPH101, which leverages a gene correction platform (CRISPR / homology directed repair (HDR)) to restore normal hemoglobin production . There are several other groups developing gene therapy approaches for SCD in early phases of development, including Beam Therapeutics, CSL Behring, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Novartis), and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). 
CALD — The current standard of care for the treatment of CALD is allogeneic HSCT. We understand that various academic centers around the world are seeking to develop improvements to allogeneic HSCT, such as Magenta Therapeutic, Inc.’s cord blood expansion technology which is currently being investigated in a phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of inherited metabolic disorders, including adrenoleukodystrophy. Other possible treatments being investigated include Orpheris, Inc.’s OP-101, Minoryx Therapeutics’ MIN-102 (leriglitazone), and Viking Therapeutics’ VK0214.
Multiple Myeloma — The current standard of care for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma includes IMIDs (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., daratumamab, elotuzumab), cytotoxic agents, and HSCT. There are several groups developing autologous T cell therapies for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that use a similar autologous ex vivo approach, but a different target antigen, BCMA single-chain variable fragment or, we believe, cell processing techniques. These programs include: an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that is in a phase 1b/2 study in the United States (Nanjing Legend in collaboration with Janssen Biotech); an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that is in phase 1 study (Poseida Therapeutics, Inc.); an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy in clinical development (phase 1/2) sponsored by BMS following the completion of its acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc and an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that is in phase I study (Innovent Biologics Inc). In addition to these autologous T cell-based approaches, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Poseida, and CRISPR Therapeutics have disclosed preclinical programs for allogeneic BCMA CAR T cell therapies. There are also therapies using other modalities being developed by several groups, including multiple bispecific T cell engagers, including programs currently in clinical studies supported by Amgen Inc., Regeneron, Janssen Research and Development, LLC, BMS, as well as a specific antibody therapy currently in a phase 1 study supported by Pfizer, Inc., and an antibody drug conjugate therapy supported by GSK that underwent a BLA submission, and those being developed in preclinical programs. 
T cell-based immunotherapies in oncology — Hundreds of academic laboratories, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are researching and developing T cell-based immunotherapies in oncology, in addition to the multiple myeloma programs described above. These include and are not limited to Novartis AG, Adaptimmune Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Amgen, Inc., Sanofi and Takeda among others. Many of the T cell-based immunotherapy programs being developed by these companies are in phase 1/2 clinical trials for multiple indications. Cancer therapies in other modalities, such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and dendritic cell vaccines, as well as combinatorial approaches are also in development across a wide range of targets. 
Government regulation
In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the CBER, regulates gene therapy products. The CBER works closely with the NIH. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.
Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from successfully commercializing our product or any future products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, in the past, a protocol and related documentation was submitted to and the study was registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Pursuant to the current NIH Guidelines, research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules must be approved by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Such trials remain subject to FDA and other clinical trial regulations, and only after FDA, IBC, and other relevant approvals are in place can these protocols proceed.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in 
relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH has a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and 
effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Regenerative medicine advanced therapies designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products.  Regenerative medicine advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based 
products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271.  This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation.  A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND.  FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.  A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.  Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval.  A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Post-approval requirements
Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of ZYNTEGLO and any future products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug or biological products or that hold approved BLAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly-discovered safety issue.
We also must comply with the FDA’s and other jursidictions’ advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising and advertising to healthcare professionals, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. Consequences could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare 
professionals, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Healthcare and Privacy Laws
In addition to restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state/ federal laws and trade association membership codes of conduct have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include Anti-Kickback and false claims statutes. The U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging healthcare professionals or patients as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. 
Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs.
The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The U.S. federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to prescribers and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. A number of other countries, states and municipalities have also implemented additional payment tracking and reporting requirements, which if not done correctly may result in additional penalties.
In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. In many other countries, healthcare professionals who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by government entities, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities. Our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA.
Other countries, including a number of EU member states, have laws of similar application, including anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. Under the UK Bribery Act, a company that carries on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person in any country by employees or other persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability under the UK Bribery Act is strict, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to 
business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In California the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing information. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these various healthcare and privacy laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
Government regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. The EMA has established the Adaptive Pathways pilot program intended to expedite or facilitate either an initial approval of a medicinal product in a well-defined patient subgroup with a high medical need and subsequent iterative expansion of the indication to a larger patient population, or an early regulatory approval (e.g., conditional approval), which is prospectively planned, and where uncertainty is reduced through the collection of post-approval data on a medicinal product’s use in patients. The approach builds in regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework.
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application during such eight-year period starting from the date of grant of the innovative medicinal product's marketing authorization. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity (and the grant of the relevant generic or biosimilar marketing authorization). However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union and being granted a marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union where the application for a marketing authorization includes the results of all studies conducted in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation itself does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
•The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
•The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
•The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU member states’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU member state legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products.  These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s approved labeling. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU.  The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products.  Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.  These laws may further limit or restrict communications concerning the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Failure to comply with the EU member state laws implementing the Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU member state laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU member state authorities (or in addition, in some member states, enforcement action from industry bodies or legal action from competitors), which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
The national laws of certain EU member states require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed.  Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of the EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals.  In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states.  These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Central and South America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.  This act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK.  In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including governments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. Third-party payers can include government healthcare systems, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety, efficacy, and overall value. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Federal, state and local governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drug products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate systems under which products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of studies or analyses of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines, but exert cost controls in other ways, including but not limited to, placing revenue caps on product sales, providing reimbursement for only a subset of eligible patients, mandating price negotiations after a set period of time, or mandating that prices not exceed an average basket of prices in other countries. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, European 
governments may periodically review and decrease prices based on factors, including but not limited to, years-on-market, price in other countries, competitive entry, new clinical data, lack of supporting clinical data, or other factors. 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
We have proposed novel payment models, including outcomes-based arrangements with payments over time, to assist with realizing the value and sharing the risk of a potential one-time treatment, such as for ZYNTEGLO. While we are engaged in discussions with potential payers, there is no assurance that these payment models will be widely adopted by payers. Even with these payment models, there may be substantial resistance to the cost of our products by payers and the public generally. These payment models may not be sufficient for payers to grant coverage, and if we are unable to obtain adequate coverage for our products, the adoption of our products and access for patients may be limited. In addition, to the extent reimbursement for our products is subject to outcomes-based arrangements, our future revenues from product sales will be more at risk. These factors could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
COVID-19
Beginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. As a result, we continue to experience disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. We continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies at our locations to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory or manufacturing facility, a work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel, and a phased approach to bringing personnel back to our locations over time. Given the importance of supporting our patients, we are diligently working with our suppliers, healthcare providers and partners to provide patients with access to ZYNTEGLO, while taking into account regulatory, institutional, and government guidance, policies and protocols. Further, we are working with our clinical study sites to understand the duration and scope of the impact on enrollment, develop protocols to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other activities for our ongoing clinical studies. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2020 financial results.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Human capital
As of January 31, 2021, we had 1,213 full-time employees, 223 of whom have Ph.D., M.D. or Pharm.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 750 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 463 employees are engaged in commercial, finance, legal, business development, human resources, information technology, facilities and other general administrative functions. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Compensation and benefits programs
Our compensation programs are designed to align our employees' interests with the drivers of growth and stockholder returns by supporting the Company's achievement of its primary business goals. The Company's goal is to attract and retain employees whose talents, expertise, leadership, and contributions are expected to sustain growth and drive long-term stockholder value. Consequently, we provide employee wages that are competitive within our industry, and we engage a nationally-recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. We seek to align our 
employees' interests with those of stockholders by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the employee’s financial interests with the interests of shareholders. We are also committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. All employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) plan, and group life and disability coverage. 
Employee development and training
The development, recruitment and retention of our employees is a critical success factor for our company. To ensure we provide a meaningful experience for our employees, we regularly measure organizational culture and engagement to build on the competencies that are important for our future success. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established programs to support the talent pipeline for critical roles throughout our organization, to help us identify, foster, and retain high performing employees. To empower our employees to realize their potential at bluebird, we provide a range of development programs, opportunities and resources they need to be successful, including leveraging formal leadership training and coaching to improve performance and retention, increase our organizational learning and support the promotion of our current employees. 
Diversity
We are committed to taking action to help address racial injustice and inequality. With significant input from employees and leaders at bluebird, our senior leadership team and board of directors has developed a set of commitments to help improve representation and culture of inclusion by pledging to accomplish the following by 2025: 
•Double our Black, Indigenous, and Latino employee population; 
•Balance our executive leadership and board of directors to ensure 50% representation of women and people of color; and
•Sustain 100% pay equity and increase representation of women and people of color across all levels.
