 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of CYT-0851, an oral investigational drug that inhibits monocarboxylate transporters.
CYT-0851 is an investigational monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor, or MCT inhibitor, initially evaluated in a phase 1/2 study to treat patients with hematologic malignancies and so1lid tumors as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies. Inhibiting MCT function in glycolytic cancer cells leads to an accumulation of intracellular lactate that impairs glycolysis and inhibits tumor cell growth, making MCTs an attractive target for cancer therapy.
In January 2023, we reported encouraging preliminary clinical activity in a small number of patients observed in the phase 1 dose-escalation cohort with CYT-0851 in combination with capecitabine in advanced ovarian cancer. In this combination dose-escalation cohort, we enrolled a total of thirteen patients at dose levels of 100 mg to 400 mg of CYT-0851, which included five patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Based on preliminary data for these five patients, we observed one confirmed partial response, two disease stabilizations and two patients that were non-evaluable. Overall, CYT-0851 was generally well tolerated. At the highest tested dose, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Based on these results, we determined that 400 mg of CYT-0851 was the recommended phase 2 dose in combination with capecitabine, and we expanded enrollment in the CYT-0851 and capecitabine combination cohort to enroll additional patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Enrollment is ongoing and we expect to disclose data from these additional patients in mid-2023. If the data from these additional patients further support our focus on ovarian cancer, we intend to add a phase 2 expansion cohort of this combination and, if warranted, pursue further development and potential registration of CYT-0851 in combination with capecitabine as an all-oral treatment for platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
 We also continue to evaluate CYT-0851 in combination with gemcitabine in phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts, and we expect to disclose preliminary results from these cohorts in mid-2023. In January 2023, we announced the suspension of enrollment in the CYT-0851 Phase 2 monotherapy cohort due to insufficient activity observed with CYT-0851 alone.
In addition to prioritizing CYT-0851 development as a potential combination therapy to treat advanced ovarian cancer, we deferred all other research and development activities and reduced our headcount by approximately 70%. We expect to have no more than 15 employees by April 1, 2023.
CYT-0851
CYT-0851 is an investigational MCT inhibitor, proposed for the treatment of cancer patients with solid tumors. In preclinical studies, CYT-0851 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity, cancer cell selectivity, and favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles that support its potential as a novel therapy that could address the serious unmet need in multiple cancers. MCTs are membrane transporters of monocarboxylated biomolecules such as lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies and are frequently upregulated in cancer cells as part of the tumor metabolic reprogramming phenomenon. Metabolic reprogramming has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer, enabling tumor cells to survive and out-compete normal cells for the available oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients required to support increased cell proliferation, facilitate metastasis, and avoid anti-tumor immunity. This phenomenon involves a shift in tumor cell bioenergetics to increased utilization of glycolysis, leading to the production of large amounts of lactate from glucose. The export of intracellular lactate is predominately accomplished by passive transport through cell surface-expressed MCTs. CYT-0851 disrupts lactate transport and glycolysis via inhibition of MCT1 activity and this inhibitory activity correlates with its anti-cancer activity across a panel of cancer cell lines. By disrupting lactate transport in glycolytic cancer cells, CYT-0851 has the potential to become an effective treatment for multiple cancers.
To expand the potential therapeutic benefit of CYT-0851 as a combination therapy, we have preclinically evaluated the effects of combining it with chemotherapies that are currently used to treat patients with both hematologic and solid tumor cancers. In vitro combination studies demonstrated synergy (as shown in the figures below) or additive effects when CYT-0851 was combined with antimetabolite or alkylating chemotherapy agents including gemcitabine and 5-Fluorouracil, or 5-FU. Capecitabine is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5’-DFUR) which is converted to 5-FU, and can be considered as an oral form of 5-FU. Combination effects have been shown in pancreatic, colorectal and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. These observations were consistent with our hypothesis that by inhibiting lactate transport in glycolytic cells and thereby disrupting glycolytic flux and biomolecule availability, particularly nucleotide pools, CYT-0851 may augment the activity of nucleotide biosynthesis-targeting anti-metabolite therapies.


In vitro, CYT-0851 has demonstrated synergy with 5-FU in pancreatic cancer cell lines. As shown below, CYT‑0851 significantly improved the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU in the PANC 04.03 pancreatic cell line.

In vitro, CYT-0851 has demonstrated synergy with gemcitabine in colorectal and pancreatic cancer. As shown below, CYT-0851 significantly improved the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine in the HCT116 colorectal cell line.

CYT-0851 Clinical Development
 We efficiently and expeditiously advanced CYT-0851 into the clinic with a development strategy designed to support the potential regulatory approval for treatment of patients with certain hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. We initially evaluated CYT-0851 as a monotherapy in a phase 1 dose-escalation cohort.
The primary objectives of the phase 1 dose-escalation trial with CYT-0851 were to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and to evaluate safety and tolerability. Key secondary objectives included determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters, optimal dosing regimen and preliminary anti-tumor activity. As presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Oncology in 2022, using an April 13, 2022 data cutoff, 80 patients were enrolled across 12 dose-escalation cohorts from 30 mg to 1200 mg total daily dose. Eighty patients were

evaluable for safety and 65 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 600 mg once a day for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The recommended phase 2 dose was determined to be 400 mg once a day, a convenient and potentially commercially attractive schedule.
 In solid tumors, 45 patients were response evaluable and one unconfirmed partial response, or PR, was achieved in a patient with soft-tissue sarcoma who was treated for almost 11 months. Nineteen patients (42%) had stable disease and 12 patients (27%) had a decrease in target lesion size for an overall disease control rate of 44%. Stable disease (42%) was seen in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, head and neck squamous cell, pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancers.
 In hematologic cancers, 18 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma were response evaluable. Responses were seen in patients with follicular lymphoma (one complete response, or CR, and one PR) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (one PR). Three patients with follicular lymphoma, one patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one patient with hairy-cell leukemia achieved stable disease. Patients responding to CYT-0851 exhibited a durable clinical benefit as evidenced by the more than 18 months of treatment in the patient with follicular lymphoma who achieved a CR.
CYT-0851 has exhibited a generally well tolerated safety profile with 42% of patients reporting no treatment related adverse events, or TRAEs. At the recommended phase 2 dose or below, no patient discontinued therapy for TRAEs and the most common TRAEs observed in at least 10% of patients were fatigue (18%), alopecia (14%), nausea (11%), and hyperuricemia (10%). The dose limiting toxicity was reversible metabolic acidosis, consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug.
Preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses of CYT-0851 demonstrated approximately dose-proportional systemic exposure. A mean plasma effective half-life of approximately three days supported transition from twice-daily to once-daily administration. Furthermore, the minimum exposure projected to be clinically active, based on preclinical studies, was reached at 90 mg total daily dose.
 CYT-0851 Monotherapy Studies
 Based on the tolerability and preliminary efficacy signals in our phase 1 monotherapy dose-escalation cohorts with CYT-0851, we moved into seven phase 2 expansion monotherapy cohorts in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
In January 2023, we announced that enrollment in our phase 2 monotherapy cohorts was suspended due to insufficient observed activity or enrollment. We enrolled a total of 44 patients in these cohorts with hematologic malignancies (diffuse large B-cell malignancies, follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma) or solid tumors (sarcoma, pancreatic, ovarian and triple negative breast). Preliminary unaudited results showed that no patients achieved a partial response and 31% achieved disease control with stable disease. CYT-0851 was generally well-tolerated and preliminary data shows that the most common treatment related adverse events in the phase 2 monotherapy cohorts observed in more than 10% of patients were fatigue (21%), and nausea (16%), consistent with the safety data from the phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts.
In addition to the monotherapy evaluation, supported by preclinical evidence and a safety profile that showed non-overlapping adverse events with the chosen standard of care treatments, we initiated phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts with CYT-0851 in combination with standard of care therapies, with the status of these cohorts as follows:

Phase 1 Combination Dose- Escalation Cohorts | Status 
CYT-0851 + Capecitabine | Dose-escalation complete. Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is 400 mg daily. Enrolling additional patients with ovarian cancer at the RP2D..
CYT-0851 + Gemcitabine | Dose-escalation ongoing, expected to be completed by mid-2023 
CYT-0851 + Rituximab and Bendamustine | Enrollment incomplete – discontinued due to changing treatment landscape 

 
In our phase 1 CYT-0851 and capecitabine combination dose-escalation cohort, we enrolled a total of thirteen patients at dose levels of 100 mg to 400 mg of CYT-0851, which included five patients with advanced ovarian cancer. At the time of our preliminary results announced in January 2023, we received data that two patients with ovarian cancer reached a partial response with the CYT-0851 (at doses of 300 mg and 400 mg per day, respectively) and capecitabine combination, but upon further data validation and confirmation, it was determined that only one patient had reached a confirmed partial response and the other patient reached stable disease. As a result, of the five patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the CYT-0851 and capecitabine combination dose-escalation cohorts, we observed one confirmed partial response and two stable diseases, and two patients were non-evaluable for response. CYT-0851 in combination with capecitabine was generally well tolerated and preliminary data shows that the most common TRAEs observed in at least 10% of patients in the phase 1 capecitabine

combination therapy cohorts were fatigue (21%), and nausea, decreased appetite, dry skin, mucosal inflammation, and maculopapular rash (each at 14%).
 Based on the dose-escalation results, the recommended phase 2 dose of CYT-0851 in combination with capecitabine is 400 mg, which was the maximum tested dose, and we are enrolling up to an additional nine patients with advanced ovarian cancer at the recommended phase 2 dose. We expect to disclose data from these additional patients and the patients treated in the CYT-0851 and capecitabine dose-escalation cohorts in mid-2023. If warranted, we plan to enroll a 20-30 patient phase 2 expansion cohort in platinum resistant ovarian cancer in the ongoing phase 1/2 trial. At the completion of the expansion cohort, if warranted by the totality of the phase 1/2 ovarian cancer patient data and subject to FDA agreement, we seek to initiate a randomized phase 2 clinical trial with registrational intent in platinum resistant ovarian cancer with the CYT-0851 and capecitabine combination in 2024.
The phase 1 CYT-0851 and gemcitabine combination dose-escalation cohort was designed to evaluate the combination of CYT-0851 and gemcitabine in up to four cohorts from 100 mg to 400 mg in patients with solid tumors, including breast, pancreatic, ovarian, head and neck cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma. We have declared 100 mg and 200 mg dose levels as tolerable, with the 300 mg cohort ongoing. We expect to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended phase 2 dose of CYT-0851 in combination with gemcitabine and disclose preliminary data from the CYT-0851 and gemcitabine dose-escalation cohorts in mid-2023.
 
Solid tumors and the current standard of care
Solid tumors are cancers originating from an organ or tissue outside the blood and lymphatic systems. These tumors are further classified, named and ultimately treated based on their tissue of origin, such as breast, ovarian or pancreatic cancer. Solid tumors are responsible for the vast majority of cancers and account for more than 1.7 million new diagnoses in the United States annually. Unlike hematologic malignancies, some solid tumors are identified early through screening procedures or symptomatic presentation prior to spreading throughout the body. In these instances, the cancer can often be removed by surgical excision to ultimately cure the patient’s disease. Outcomes for early-stage disease are highly variable across tumor types, with most early-stage colorectal and breast cancers being cured and almost all pancreatic cancers recurring and metastasizing even despite early intervention. Once solid tumors metastasize, or spread to other sites in the body, the goal of therapy often shifts to long-term control and palliation since cures are typically unattainable. In this incurable setting, the most effective therapies are typically used in combination with the first lines of treatment, and subsequent lines of treatment typically become progressively less effective. The number of available lines of therapy is disease type-specific and generally ranges from as low as one to two lines of therapy in pancreatic cancer and soft tissue sarcoma to more than five lines of therapy in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Patients remain on treatment until they have exhausted all therapeutic options, develop symptoms that preclude further treatment or elect to stop further treatment of their cancer.

Market opportunity in solid tumors with capecitabine and gemcitabine combination therapy
 To date in our phase 1/2 clinical trial of CYT-0851, we have observed responses in the dose-escalation cohorts of CYT-0851 with capecitabine and gemcitabine. These observations are consistent with our preclinical data indicating that a subset of solid tumor cancer models, including pancreatic and breast cancer patient derived xenograft models, are sensitive to CYT-0851, and that the combination with capecitabine or gemcitabine is additive or synergistic in preclinical models. We are further evaluating the activity of CYT-0851 in patients with pancreatic and ovarian cancers, as well as soft tissue sarcomas, in the phase 1/2 combination cohorts, with a focus on patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the CYT-0851 and capecitabine combination cohort.
 We currently define the initial target patient population of CYT-0851 plus capecitabine in ovarian cancer patients that are platinum resistant and have failed 2-3 prior lines of treatment. We estimate that there may be up to approximately 13,000 patients meeting these treatment criteria annually in the U.S.
The initial target patient population for CYT-0851 plus gemcitabine has not been determined. We are currently enrolling patients in the phase 1 dose-escalation cohort with breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and head and neck cancer, as well as soft tissue sarcoma.
 Competition
While we believe that our technology and drug development expertise provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions that are involved in the discovery, development, and commercialization of oncology therapeutics. For the initial target patient

population in platinum resistant ovarian cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy, if approved, CYT-0851 will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications, including:
 •Chemotherapy agents, such as topotecan, liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel;
 •Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab;
 •Antibody-drug conjugates, such as mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx;
 •Targeted therapies, such as the PARP inhibitors olaparib, niraparib, talazoparib, rucaparib;
 •Immunotherapy, such as pembrolizumab; and
 •Other therapies in development, such as luvelta (Sutro), batiraxcept (Aravive), Upifitamab Rilsodotin (Mersana), navicixizumab (Mereo/OncXerna), farletuzumab (Esai/BMS), avutometinib (Verastem), ACR-368 (Acrivon), and ZN-c3(Zentalis), and others. 
 Our success will be based upon our ability to advance CYT-0851 through clinical development to regulatory approval and successful commercialization. We believe that CYT-0851 has the potential to be more tolerable and more effective than competing products in our target indications in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel relative to peer companies in light of the highly competitive market for talent in the biopharmaceutical industry, to obtain and maintain patent protection or otherwise to develop proprietary products and protect and enforce our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital to support our research and development efforts in a way that allows us achieve our preclinical and clinical development goals relative to our competitors.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, or are less expensive than our drug candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Approved agents that are generic may be favored by payors and patients.
Intellectual property
We strive to obtain, maintain, protect, enforce and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights, in particular our patents rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties; and prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary rights that cover these activities.
For CYT-0851, as of February 28, 2023, we hold three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, 28 issued foreign patents and 17 pending foreign patent applications directed to composition-of-matter coverage and related uses. We also hold seven pending U.S. patent applications and 35 pending foreign patent applications that provide method-of-use coverage for monotherapies or combination therapies with CYT-0851 for oncology indications. The foregoing patents and patent applications, if issued, will have statutory expiration dates between 2038 and 2043, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions that may be available.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file patent applications, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in the U.S., in certain instances, a patent term can be extended by a

patent term adjustment to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, review period in issuing the patent and/or by patent term extension to account for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, and a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our owned and licensed pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our owned or licensed patents or whether such claims, if issued, will cover our drug candidates, provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Any issued patents that we may receive or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable, infringed or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
We cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our owned or licensed patents and pending patent applications, in part because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patents and patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter.
In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators who are involved in the creation of our technology. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the counterparty. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection, and we cannot guarantee that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
See “Risk Factors ‒ Risks Related to our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Manufacturing
We currently rely and expect to continue relying on contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to manufacture our drug substances and drug products for preclinical and clinical testing and for future commercial manufacturing of our products. We require the CDMOs manufacturing our drug substances and drug products for clinical testing to comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the required technical, quality, and regulatory oversight over our CDMOs. The development of our analytical methods to control and analyze our products is maintain at a phase appropriate level corresponding to the clinical development. 
Our drug substances are small molecules and our CDMOs manufacture them by synthetic processes from available starting materials. We expect to continue the development of the manufacturing processes of our drug substances at CDMOs and to produce them in a cost-effective manner and meeting all regulatory requirements.
Government regulation

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our drug candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our drug development, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies
 •conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
 •completion of the manufacture, under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the sponsor and the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potentially, satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
 Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the drug candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together

with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold and any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until the deficiencies articulated by FDA are corrected.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may recommend to the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as a lack of observed efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. For example, information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, FDA will nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
 •Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. It is common to combine phase 1 and phase 2 studies in oncology drug development. 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. marketing approval for drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA package requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA must approve an NDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if it believes that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.


Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Expedited development and review programs for drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.
 A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical

development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review, once an NDA is submitted, if the drug that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and NDA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing marketing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.

U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the generation of additional data or the conduct of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
 Patent term restoration and extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension, or PTE, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. As compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term, which is limited to a maximum of five years, or less if the extended patent term would exceed 14 years after the date of the regulatory approval of the product. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA, less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period and the approval of that application less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or drug product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only extended once based on a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Similar

provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of a patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any PTE or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Marketing exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FD&C Act can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FD&C Act alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In addition, pediatric exclusivity and orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a six-month or seven-year period of exclusivity, respectively, except in certain circumstances.
Regulation of companion diagnostics
Companion diagnostics are diagnostic tests designed to identify patients who may be most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product, identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product, or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
 Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing

authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.
 A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities.
 Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of drug candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other healthcare laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from 


government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies.
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 •The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which imposes annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Since January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 •Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers; restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which

has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a drug candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasingly used as models for how private and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists, however, among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.
 Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, with respect to the Affordable Care Act, tax reform legislation was enacted that eliminated the tax penalty established for

individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019, and in 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, with a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, including bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Although a number of these measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2032.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States

To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located at 128 Spring St, Building A, Suite 510, Lexington, MA 02421, where we lease and occupy approximately 20,167 square feet of office and laboratory space. The current term of our 128 Spring St. lease expires in 2025.
To meet the future needs of our business, we may lease additional or alternate space, and we believe suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 46 full-time employees. Twenty-two of our employees have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. As of December 31, 2022, within our workforce, 35 employees were engaged in research and development and 11 were engaged in business development, finance, legal, human resources, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 In January 2023, we announced a reduction in force and termination of approximately 70% of our employees in connection with the prioritization of our CYT-0851 program and suspension of internal research. As a result, we expect to have no more than 15 employees by April 1, 2023.
 Our human capital priorities and objectives include retaining and developing our staff. We seek to create and maintain a workplace with an inclusive culture that provides challenging and rewarding work, and creates the opportunity for everyone to contribute their best on behalf of patients and all stakeholders we serve. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to support these objectives, and to recognize staff member performance and align it to the growth and success of the company. Share-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards are extended to selected employees, consultants and directors.
