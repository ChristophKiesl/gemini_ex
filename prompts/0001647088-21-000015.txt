ITEM 1.    Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refers to WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. ("WillScot Mobile Mini") and its subsidiaries.
Our Company
Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, we are a leading business services provider specializing in innovative flexible work space and portable storage solutions. We service diverse end markets across all sectors of the economy from a network of approximately 275 branch locations and additional drop lots throughout the United States (“US”), Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom ("UK").
With roots dating back more than 60 years, we lease modular space and portable storage units (our “lease fleet”) to customers in the commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government, and other end markets. We offer our customers an extensive section of “Ready to Work” solutions. In addition to our "Ready to Work" solutions, we offer value-added products and services, such as the rental of steps, ramps, and furniture packages, damage waivers, and other amenities to improve the overall customer experience. These turnkey solutions offer customers flexible, low-cost, and timely solutions to meet their flexible work space and storage needs on an outsourced basis. 
On July 1, 2020, WillScot Corporation ("WillScot") combined with Mobile Mini, Inc. ("Mobile Mini") in a stock-for-stock merger (the "Merger"), and WillScot changed names to WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. WillScot Mobile Mini is the holding company for the Williams Scotsman and Mobile Mini family of companies. As a result of the Merger, the Company operates in four reportable segments as follows: North America Modular Solutions ("NA Modular"), North America Storage Solutions ("NA Storage"), United Kingdom Storage Solutions ("UK Storage"), and Tank and Pump Solutions ("Tank and Pump"). The NA Modular segment aligns with the WillScot legacy business prior to the Merger, and the NA Storage, UK Storage, and Tank and Pump segments align with the Mobile Mini segments prior to the Merger. Within this Annual Report, we have presented certain financial information on a pro forma basis and supplemental pro forma financial statements within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to include Mobile Mini's results as if the Merger and related financing transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019, as we believe this is a better representation of the go-forward combined company and is useful to investors. 
Products and Services
Modular Space Solutions
Our modular space units meet a broad range of customer needs. Our modular units are typically made of steel and aluminum frames, as well as traditional building materials, and range from standalone portable units as small as 24 square feet to large complex units that can be coupled together or stacked to create versatile work spaces in excess of 10,000 square feet. In all cases, we deploy modular units to customers rapidly from our extensive branch network using our hybrid in-house and outsourced logistics and service infrastructure. We specialize in turnkey ‘Ready to Work’ solutions, which means our units can arrive fully equipped with air conditioning, heating, and filtration units, electrical and Ethernet ports, plumbing and utility hookups, as well as our proprietary line of furnishings and appliances, which we together refer to as Value-Added Products and Services (“VAPS”). Our units are transported by truck, either towed (if fitted with axles and hitches) or mounted on flat-bed trailers. 
Modular space units have attractive economic characteristics, and our ability to lease and maintain our assets’ profitability over economic lives, which often exceed 20 years, is a unique capability and competitive advantage. We utilize standard fleet maintenance procedures across the branch network, monitor fleet condition and allocate capital expenditures centrally, and ensure all units meet consistent quality and condition requirements, regardless of unit age, prior to delivery to a customer. Modular leasing is complemented by new unit sales and sales of rental units. In connection with our leasing and sales activities, we provide services including delivery and installation, maintenance and ad hoc services, and removal services at the end of lease transactions.
Panelized and Stackable Offices. Our FlexTM panelized and stackable offices are the next generation of modular space technology and offer maximum flexibility and design configurations. These units provide a modern, innovative design, smaller footprint, ground level access, and interchangeable panels, including all glass panels that allow customers to configure the space to their precise requirements. These units have the ability to expand upwards (up to three stories) and outwards, providing maximum versatility.
Single-Wide Modular Space Units. Single-wide modular space units include mobile offices and sales offices. These units offer maximum ease of installation and removal and are deployed across the broadest range of applications in our fleet. These units typically have “open interiors,” which can be modified using movable partitions, and include tile floors, air conditioning, heating, and filtration units, partitions and, if requested, toilet facilities.
Section Modulars and Redi-Plex. Section modulars are two or more units combined into one structure. Redi-Plex complexes offer advanced versatility for large, open floor plans or custom layouts with private offices. Redi-Plex is built with clearspan construction, which eliminates interference from support columns and allows for up to sixty feet of open building width and building lengths that increase in twelve-foot increments based on the number of units coupled together. Our proprietary design meets a wide range of national and state building, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing codes, which creates versatility in fleet management. Examples of section modular units include hospital diagnostic annexes, special events headquarters, temporary data centers, and larger general commercial offices.
Classrooms. Classroom units are generally double-wide units adapted specifically for use by school systems or universities. Classroom units usually feature teaching aids, air conditioning, heating, and filtration units, windows and, if requested, toilet facilities.
Ground Level Offices and Container Offices. We also offer steel ground level offices from 10 to 40 feet in length and 8 or 10 feet in width. Many of these units are converted to office use from International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified shipping containers. These offices are available in various configurations, including all-office floor plans or office and storage combination units that provide a 10‑ or 15‑foot office with the remaining area available for storage. Ground level offices provide the advantage of ground accessibility for ease of access and high security in an all‑steel design. These office units are equipped with electrical wiring, air conditioning, heating, filtration units, phone jacks, carpet or tile, high security doors, and windows with security bars or shutters. Some of these offices are also equipped with sinks, hot water heaters, cabinets, and toilet facilities.
Other Modular Space. We offer a range of other specialty products that vary across regions and provide flexibility to serve demands for local markets. Examples include workforce accommodation units with dining facilities used to house workers, often in remote locations, blast-resistant units, and toilet facilities to complement office and classroom units.
Portable Storage Solutions
Portable Storage Containers. Our portable storage containers offer an assortment of differentiated features such as patented locking systems, premium and multiple door options, optional climate control, and numerous configuration options. Standard portable storage containers are made from weather‑resistant corrugated steel and are available in lengths ranging from 5 to 48 feet, widths of either 8 feet or 10 feet, and a variety of configuration options. Doors can be placed at the front, front and back, or the sides of containers. Other options include partitions and shelving. Storage containers can be equipped with our patented Tri‑Cam Locking System®, which features a waist‑level opening lever and interlocking bars to provide easy access for the owner without sacrificing security. We also offer ContainerGuardLock®, an optional security device, which features a hidden six‑pin tumbler system and is made from drill‑resistant hardened steel. We believe these steel storage containers are a cost‑effective alternative to mass warehouse storage, with a high level of security to protect our customers' goods.
Steel containers have a long useful life with no technical obsolescence. Our portable storage containers have estimated useful lives of 30 years from the date we build or acquire and remanufacture them, with average residual values in excess of 50%. We maintain our steel containers on a regular basis by removing rust, painting them with rust inhibiting paint, plug‑welding holes, and occasionally replacing the wooden floor or a rusted steel panel. Repainting the outside of storage units is the most common maintenance item. A properly maintained container is essentially in the same condition as when it was initially remanufactured.
The remanufacturing process begins with the purchase of used ISO containers from leasing companies, shipping lines, and brokers. These containers were originally built to ISO standards and are 8 feet wide, up to 9.5 feet high and 20, 40 or 45 feet long. After acquisition, we remanufacture and modify these ISO containers. Remanufacturing typically involves cleaning, removing rust and dents, repairing floors and sidewalls, painting, adding our signs, and further customizing units by adding our proprietary easy opening door system and our patented locking system. Modification typically involves splitting some containers into differing lengths.
VAPS
We offer a thoughtfully curated portfolio of VAPS that make modular space and portable storage units more productive, comfortable, secure, and “Ready to Work” for our customers. We lease furniture, steps, ramps, basic appliances, internet connectivity devices, and other items to our customers for use in connection with our products. We also offer our lease customers a damage waiver program that protects them in case the leased unit is damaged. For customers who do not select the damage waiver program, we bill them for the cost of repairs above and beyond normal wear and tear. Importantly, management believes that our scale, branch network, supply chain, and sales performance management tools give us a significant advantage in delivering “Ready to Work” solutions and growing VAPS revenue relative to our competitors. 
Delivery, Installation and Removal
We operate a hybrid in-house and outsourced logistics and service infrastructure that provides delivery, site work, installation, disassembly, unhooking and removal, and other services to our customers for an additional fee as part of our leasing and sales operations. Revenue from delivery, site work, and installation results from the transportation of units to a customer's location, site work required prior to installation, and installation of the units which have been leased or sold. Typically, modular units are placed on temporary foundations constructed by our in‑house service technicians or 
subcontractors. These in‑house service technicians or subcontractors also generally install any ancillary products and VAPS. We also derive revenue from disassembling, unhooking, and removing units once a lease expires. We believe that our logistics and service capabilities are unrivaled in the industry, differentiate us from competitors, and enhance our value proposition to our customers.
Tank and Pump Solutions
Our Tank and Pump Solutions business offers a broad range of liquid and solid specialty containment equipment and services complemented by an assortment of pumps, filtration units, and waste hauling services. In addition, ancillary products for rental and for sale are available, such as hoses, pipes, filters, and spill containment. Our principal products and services within our Tank and Pump Solutions business include steel tanks, stainless steel tank trailers, roll‑off boxes, vacuum boxes, dewatering boxes, pumps and filtration equipment, and value‑added services. 
Our fleet of steel tanks offers flexible sizes and other options such as weir, gas buster, and open top steel tanks for applications ranging from temporary storage of chemicals, water, and other liquids, thorough mixing, agitation, and circulation of stored liquids with other products, and removal of gas from fluids circulated in the wellbore—such as mud used during drilling operations and settling of solids in liquids prior to filtration or discharge. Our stainless-steel tankers meet Department of Transportation specifications for use in the storage and transportation of chemical, caustics, and other liquids and are offered insulated or non‑insulated with level indication and vapor recovery capability. Roll‑off boxes provide simple, leak‑proof storage and transportation of solid industrial byproducts and are utilized for a variety of containment applications where it is necessary to maintain the homogeneity of the contents. Roll-tarps or rolling metal lids are available to protect the contents from the elements during transport or storage. Vacuum roll‑off boxes are also offered to pair with a vacuum truck for containment, storage, or transportation of pressurized contents. Dewatering boxes are configured to provide for the draining of excess liquid from slurry or sludge which reduces storage, transportation, and disposal costs. Upon completion of dewatering, the container is generally picked up by a roll‑off truck for content disposal. Vacuum dewatering boxes are also offered. In addition, we offer a variety of pumps and filtration equipment that can be used primarily for liquid circulation and filtration in municipal and industrial applications. 
Additional services performed by our specialty containment employees include transportation of containers for waste management between multiple locations or in-plant, waste management oversight and service provision by an on-site dedicated team, system design including assessment of pumping, filtration and temporary storage needs, and field services to correctly install and connect customer containment equipment.
Product Leases
We primarily lease our modular and portable storage units to customers, which results in a highly diversified and predictable recurring revenue stream. For the year ended December 31, 2020, over 90% of new lease orders were on our standard lease agreement, pre-negotiated master lease, or national account agreements. The initial lease periods vary, and our leases are customarily renewable on a month-to-month basis after their initial term. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the average effective duration of our consolidated lease portfolio was approximately 32 months. As a result, our lease revenue is highly predictable due to its recurring nature and the underlying stability and diversification of our lease portfolio.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our average minimum contractual lease term at the time of delivery in our NA Modular segment for modular space units and portable storage units was 11 months and 7 months, respectively. However, given that our customers value flexibility, they consistently extend their leases or renew on a month-to-month basis such that the average effective duration of our NA Modular segment lease portfolio was over 34 months. Customers are responsible for the costs of delivery and set-up, dismantling and pick-up, customer-specified modifications, costs to return custom modifications back to standard configuration at end of lease, and any loss or damage beyond normal wear and tear. Our leases generally require customers to maintain liability and property insurance covering the units during the lease term and to indemnify us from losses caused by the negligence of the customer or their employees.
Rental contracts with customers within our NA Storage and UK Storage segments are generally based on a 28‑day rate and billing cycle. The rental continues until cancelled by the customer or us. On average, steel storage containers on rent in our NA Storage and UK Storage segments for the year ended December 31, 2020 had been in place for over 31 months, and the steel ground level offices on rent for the year ended December 31, 2020 had been in place for approximately 15 months. Rental contracts provide that the customer is responsible for the cost of delivery and pickup and specify that the customer is liable for any damage done to the unit beyond ordinary wear and tear. Customers may purchase a damage waiver to avoid damage liability in certain circumstances, which provides an additional source of recurring revenue. Customer possessions stored within a portable storage unit are the responsibility of that customer.
Rental contracts with Tank and Pump Solutions customers typically offer daily, weekly, or monthly rates. Certain larger customers have multi‑year agreements that limit rate increases during the term of the contract. The rental duration varies widely by application, and the rental continues until the unit is returned in clean condition to us. Rental contracts specify that the customer is responsible for carrying commercial general liability insurance, is liable for any damage to the unit beyond ordinary wear and tear, and for all materials the customer contains in rented equipment. The customer is contractually responsible for the cost of delivery and pickup, as well as thoroughly emptying and cleaning the equipment before return.
Demand for our products varies by end market. Construction customers typically reflect higher demand during months with more temperate weather, while demand from large retailers is stronger from September through December, when 
more space is needed to store holiday inventories. Retail customers usually return these rented units in December and early in the following year, but also undertake ongoing rolling store renovations which present consistent recurring demand throughout the year. In our Tank and Pump Solutions business, demand from customers is typically higher in the middle of the year from March to October, driven by the timing of customer maintenance projects.
As of December 31, 2020, we had over 368,000 total units including over 157,000 modular space units, over 197,000 portable storage units, over 12,500 tank and pump units, and other value-added products representing fleet net book value of $2.9 billion. Approximately 109,766 of our modular space units, or 70% and 151,206 of our portable storage units, or 76% were on rent as of December 31, 2020, and tank and pump Original Equipment Cost ("OEC") utilization was 64.8% as of December 31, 2020.
Product Sales
We complement our core leasing business by selling both new and used units, allowing us to leverage our scale, achieve purchasing benefits, and redeploy capital employed in our lease fleet. Generally, we purchase new units from a broad network of third-party manufacturers. We only purchase new modular space units for resale when we have obtained firm purchase orders (which normally are non-cancelable and include up-front deposits) for such units. Buying units directly for resale adds scale to our purchasing, which is beneficial to our overall supplier relationships and purchasing terms. New unit sales are a natural extension of our leasing operations in situations where customers have long-lived or permanent projects, making it more cost-effective to purchase rather than to lease a standard unit, and our customers benefit from our product expertise and delivery and installation capabilities. 
In the normal course of managing our business, we also sell idle, used rental units at fair market value and units that are already on rent if the customer expresses interest in owning, rather than continuing to rent, the unit. The sale of units from our rental equipment has historically been both a profitable and cost-effective method to finance the replenishment and upgrade of our lease fleet, as well as to generate free cash flow during periods of lower rental demand and utilization. Our sales business may include modifying or customizing units to meet customer requirements. We also offer delivery, installation, and removal-related services for an additional fee as part of our sales operations.
Customers
Our customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including construction, commercial and industrial, retail and wholesale trade, education, energy and natural resources, government, and healthcare. Core to our operating model is the ability to redeploy standardized assets across end markets. We have recently serviced emerging demand in the healthcare and government sectors related to COVID‑19, as well as expanded space requirements related to social distancing. We track several market leading indicators in order to predict demand, including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial end market, and the construction end market, which collectively accounted for approximately 43% and 42% of our pro forma revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. In order to optimize the use of fleet assets across our branch network, we centrally manage fleet rebalancing across our end markets. This allows us to serve 15 distinct end markets in which no customer accounted for more than 2% of pro forma revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, no one customer accounted for more than 3% of our total pro forma revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no one customer accounted for more than 2% of pro forma revenues, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 6% of pro forma revenues, and our top 50 customers accounted for less than 13% of revenues on a pro forma basis, reflecting low customer concentration and significant project diversification within our portfolio. 
Our logistics and service infrastructure is designed to enable us to meet or exceed our customers’ expectations by reacting quickly, efficiently, and with consistent service levels. As a result, we have established strong relationships with a diverse customer base, ranging from large multinational companies to local sole proprietors. Including customers acquired from Mobile Mini, we served over 85,000 unique customers in 2020. We believe that our customers prefer our modular space and portable storage products over fixed, on-site built space because they are a quick, flexible, cost‑effective, and low-risk solution for temporary or permanent expansion or storage.
Our strategy involves operating standardized rental equipment and "Ready to Work" solutions that can be redeployed across our diversified customer base and branch network in 15 discrete end markets. Key customer end markets include:
Construction and Infrastructure
We provide office and storage space to a broad array of contractors associated with non-residential buildings and non-building infrastructure. Our client portfolio includes many of the largest general contractors and engineering, architecture, procurement, and construction companies in North America, as well as home builders, developers, and subcontractors. Examples include highway, street, bridge, and tunnel contractors; water, sewer, communication, and power line contractors; and special construction trades, including glass, glazing, and demolition. Our construction and infrastructure customer base is characterized by a wide variety of contractors that are associated with original construction as well as capital improvements in the private, institutional, and municipal arenas. Units are used as offices, break rooms, accommodations, security offices, and other applications. 
Commercial and Industrial
Customers in this category use our products as their primary office or retail space, to expand their existing commercial workspace, to increase their storage capabilities, or as temporary space for festivals, sporting, and other events. Customers in this category span a variety of industries ranging from commercial offices; chemicals and other manufacturing; agriculture, forestry and fishing; arts, media, hotels, and entertainment; and other industrial end markets. 
The commercial and industrial segment also includes customers in retail and wholesale trade. These include department, drug, grocery, and strip mall stores, logistics, warehousing and distribution services, as well as restaurants, service stations, and dry cleaners. Our customers in retail and wholesale trade include big‑box retailers who have storage needs during renovations or other large on-site projects. On a stand‑alone basis, retail and wholesale trade customers comprised approximately 11% of fiscal year 2020 rental revenue; on a pro forma basis, these customers comprised approximately 12% of fiscal year 2020 rental revenue.
Energy and Natural Resources
Our products are leased to companies involved in electricity generation and transmission, utilities, up- mid- and down-stream oil and gas, mining exploration and extraction, and other related sectors. Units are used as temporary offices, break rooms, accommodations, security offices, and other applications. 
Education
Rapid shifts in populations within regions, as well as recent needs to expand square footage per student in in-person education settings, often necessitate quick expansion of education facilities, particularly in elementary and secondary schools and universities and colleges. Regional and local governmental budgetary pressures, classroom size reduction legislation, refurbishment of existing facilities, and the expansion of charter schools have made modular classrooms a convenient and cost-effective way to expand capacity in education settings. In addition, our products are used as classrooms when schools are undergoing large scale modernization, which allows continuous operation of a school while modernization progresses. 
Government and Institutions
Government customers consist of national, state, provincial, and local public sector organizations. Modular space and portable storage solutions are particularly attractive to focused niches such as healthcare facilities, small municipal buildings, courthouses, military installations, national security buildings, and offices during building modernization, as well as disaster relief.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths have been instrumental to our success and position us for future growth:
North American Leader in Turnkey Modular Space and Portable Storage Solutions
The Mobile Mini Merger brought together WillScot’s leading modular space capabilities and Mobile Mini’s leading portable storage solutions to create an industry-leading specialty leasing platform. We benefit from complementary capabilities, a diverse customer base with over 85,000 customers across different end markets, and an unrivaled geographic footprint of approximately 275 branch locations and additional drop lots.
Our broad and complementary network serves the largest North American metropolitan areas with local teams who are experts in their respective markets. Our cost‑effective coverage model serves smaller customers at the local and regional level, while also addressing the needs of larger national customers looking for a full suite of high-quality services that can be provided on a consistent basis throughout North America. Since geographic proximity to customers can be a competitive advantage in the modular space and portable storage industry, we believe that our extensive branch network allows us to better serve existing customers and attract new customers.
We believe our extensive scale results in significant operational benefits, such as optimization of fleet yield and utilization, efficient capital allocation, superior service capabilities, and the ability to offer consistent "Ready to Work" solutions across all of our branch locations.
VAPS
We deliver "Ready to Work" solutions through our growing offering of VAPS, such as the rental of steps, ramps, furniture packages, damage waivers, and other amenities. This thoughtfully curated portfolio of VAPS makes modular space and portable storage units more productive, comfortable, and secure for our customers and allows us to generate higher revenue per transaction and return on capital. These turnkey solutions offer customers flexible, low‑cost, capital efficient, and timely solutions to meet their space needs on an outsourced basis.
VAPS have been a substantial source of revenue growth in our NA Modular segment. We have been able to successfully drive a material increase in customer VAPS spend into our recently acquired businesses, which generates highly tangible revenue synergies. We believe our ability to drive VAPS growth following our historical acquisitions highlights the value proposition our VAPS provide to our customers. We expect to replicate a similar cross‑selling opportunity within Mobile Mini’s ground level offices.
Sophisticated Logistics And Service Capabilities
Building off of the largest branch network in the industry, we operate a sophisticated hybrid in-house and outsourced logistics and service infrastructure that we believe is highly differentiated from our competitors and enhances the value proposition we provide to customers. Precise scheduling of installations and removals, same-day delivery capabilities on certain products, and ability to mobilize large volumes of equipment in any geography serviced by our branch network are all unique capabilities that differentiate WillScot Mobile Mini, particularly among more demanding customer segments. We believe that continuing to further optimize our logistics and service capabilities through the deployment of technology is an opportunity for further cost efficiency and differentiation with our customers.
Investments in Technology Provide a Competitive Advantage Over Our Small and Midsize Competitors
We believe our technology serves as a primary differentiator over small and midsize competitors in local markets and initiatives underway to consolidate our operations onto our state of the art SAP enterprise resource planning platform will result in further efficiencies. Effective use of real‑time information allows us to monitor and optimize the utilization of our fleet, allocate our fleet to the highest demand markets, optimize pricing, and determine the best allocation of our capital to invest in fleet and branches.
We are able to dynamically price and approach customer accounts in a strategic and statistically informed manner. We also believe our ability to leverage this data helps us to increase our market share and effectively manage supply and demand dynamics in our fleet in order to maximize cash flow in all phases of the economic cycle, including identifying opportunities where underutilized lease fleet can be sold to generate cash.
Similarly, technology is continuing to develop related to our fleet to offer an enhanced experience for our customers. Unit tracking, electronic locking/security systems, and other customer‑facing technological benefits differentiate our fleet from competitors who have not invested in these capabilities. We believe we possess superior technology infrastructure relative to our competition and we intend to extend this advantage further by leveraging our infrastructure investments.
Diversified Revenue Base by End Market, Product, Service and Geography
We have established strong relationships with a diverse customer base, ranging from large national accounts to small local businesses. Our customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, government, and other end markets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the top 50 combined customers for WillScot Mobile Mini accounted for less than 13% of pro forma revenues. We believe that the diversity of our customer end markets reduces our exposure to changes related to a given customer, shifts within an industry or geographic region, and end market industry seasonality, while also providing significant opportunities to grow our business. Furthermore, the nature of our products is such that their use is generally agnostic to industry. This flexibility insulates utilization from exposure to industry‑specific shocks, provided there are other needs and applications for these products within a reasonable distance. Accordingly, our business has been able to support front‑line workers and other essential businesses during the COVID‑19 crisis by providing temporary testing sites, treatment centers, exam rooms, hospital swing space, temperature screening checkpoints, office space to support social distancing, and storage for related supplies. 
The following chart illustrates the breakdown of our customers and revenue by end markets, on a pro forma basis, as of December 31, 2020. In order to optimize the use of fleet assets across our branch network, we centrally manage fleet rebalancing across our end markets. This allows us to serve 15 distinct end markets in which no customer accounted for more than 2% of pro forma revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

REVENUE MIX BY END MARKET | CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

Attractive Cost and Revenue Synergy Opportunities with the Ability to Leverage Best Practices Across Both Companies
We have a strong track record of integrations generating significant synergies with our acquisitions of Modular Space Holdings, Inc. ("ModSpace"), Onsite Space LLC ("Tyson"), and Acton Mobile Holdings LLC ("Acton"), driving $61.0 million in cumulative annual synergies achieved as of December 31, 2020, and an additional $10.2 million in remaining synergies expected to be realized in the future.
We anticipate approximately $50 million of annual cost savings opportunities from the combination with Mobile Mini from purchasing and procurement economies of scale and general and administrative expense savings, particularly with respect to the consolidation of corporate‑related functions and elimination of redundancies. Similar to the ModSpace integration, we expect to incur approximately $75 million of one‑time cash integration, capital investment, restructuring, lease impairment, and other related charges in the first two years post-closing to realize the annual recurring cost savings. These costs will be incurred to integrate and consolidate information technology systems and for other consulting costs, breakage costs for redundant and overlapping leased facilities, fleet relocation costs, severance, and other personnel costs. We anticipate approximately 80% of these cost savings to be realized in our run rate by the end of 2022. However, there is no guarantee that we will achieve these cost savings in the amount or in the time frame that we anticipate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Mobile Mini Merger—We may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate new operations, including Mobile Mini and our conversion to its SAP enterprise resource planning system, which could cause our business to suffer."
Our Asset Base Provides Highly Attractive Asset-Level Returns with Long Useful Lives
The combination of long, predictable lease durations, long asset lives, and attractive unit economics underpins the compelling cash generation capability in our business model. As such, we have made significant investments in our lease fleet and consolidated several competitors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our modular space and portable storage lease fleet consisted of over 121 million square feet of relocatable space, comprising over 157,000 units, and over 197,000 storage solutions containers and office units.
We believe we generate an attractive internal rate of return ("IRR") in our modular space portfolio driven by the long economic life of our fleet, exceeding 20 years on average, inclusive of any capital expenditure ("capex") required to maintain the fleet to its value maximizing earning potential. Adding VAPS to our modular units increases the IRR of those units over the 20+ year useful life of the asset. On average, the payback period of a modular unit is only 36 months including VAPS.
Similarly, we believe portable storage containers are able to generate a higher IRR over their 30‑year useful life. These units require even less maintenance capex and have an average payback period of only 30 months. We believe the stability of cash flows combined with strong economic returns make both modular space and portable storage containers highly attractive specialty rental asset classes, and our logistics and service capabilities and investments in technology further enhance the returns we can generate from these assets.
The following chart illustrates the breakdown of the net book value ("NBV") of our rental equipment between the various modular space product types, portable storage and VAPS as of December 31, 2020.
Our Business Generates Predictable Recurring Cash Flow Due to Our Long-Term Leases and Flexible Capex Requirements
Our recurring revenue, combined with our flexible capex requirements, efficient working capital, and tax profile, has allowed us to generate substantial free cash flow, both in periods of growth and economic downturn. The long term nature of our leases, with average lease durations in excess of 32 months as of December 31, 2020, produces strong operating income and predictable cash flow.
We exercise control and discretion over capex, due to the longevity and relative simplicity of our products, the ability to invest only where needed and when needed to meet demand, and the ability to sell excess fleet during lower utilization periods. During periods of economic stress, we have the ability to substantially reduce capex throughout the portfolio in order to maximize cash flow, resulting in a counter‑cyclical free cash flow profile. See discussion of “COVID‑19 impact on business" within our "Recent Developments" section below.
Our Industry 
We primarily operate within the modular space, portable storage, and specialty containment markets. Our services also span across a variety of related sectors, including furniture rental, transportation and logistics, facilities rental services, and commercial real estate.
Modular Space Market
The modular space market is fragmented. Modular space units are non-residential structures designed to meet federal, provincial, state, and local building codes and, in most cases, are designed to be relocatable. Modular space units are constructed offsite, utilizing manufacturing techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story whole building solutions in deliverable modular sections. Units are typically constructed of steel, wood and conventional building materials and can be permanent or relocatable.
The modular space market has evolved in recent years as businesses and other potential customers increasingly recognize the value of modular space. The key growth drivers in this market are similar to portable storage and include:
Growing need and demand for space: driven by general economic activity, including gross domestic product growth, industrial production, mining and natural resources activity, non-residential construction, urbanization, public and education spending, and the scale and frequency of special events.
Shift from traditional fixed, on-site built space to modular space solutions: driven by several advantages as compared with fixed, on-site built space, including:
•Quick to install: the pre-fabrication of modular space units allows them to be put in place rapidly, providing potential long-term solutions to needs that may have materialized quickly.
•Flexibility: flexible assembly design allows modular space units to be built to suit a customer’s needs while offering customers the ability to adjust their space as their needs change.
•Cost effectiveness: modular space units provide a cost-effective solution for temporary and permanent space requirements and allow customers to improve returns on capital in their core business.
•Quality: the pre-fabrication of modular space units is based on a repeatable process in a controlled environment, resulting in more consistent quality.
•Mobility: modular space units can easily be disassembled, transported to a new location and re-assembled.
•Environmentally friendly: relocatable buildings promote the reuse of facilities, on an as-needed basis, by the occupants.
Portable Storage Market
The portable storage market, like the modular space market, is highly fragmented and remains primarily local in nature. Portable storage units are typically ground‑level entry, windowless storage containers made of heavy exterior metals for secure storage and water tightness. Portable storage units can be built to specification or can be remanufactured from existing storage products, such as ISO shipping containers. Remanufacturing typically involves cleaning, removing rust and dents, repairing floors and sidewalls, painting, and adding company logos or signs as well as our patented Tri‑Cam Locking System®.
Portable storage units continue to find new applications as business needs change and develop. Demand for portable storage is driven by a number of factors, including:
Versatility: portable storage units can be easily customized to suit customer specifications. While standard applications include locking double‑door systems to facilitate loading. However, custom entrances, such as rolling or sliding doors, can be added for personnel access.
Affordability: portable storage provides customers with a flexible and low‑cost storage alternative to permanent warehouse space and fixed‑site self‑storage.
Safety: units can be easily outfitted with fire and water‑resistant surfaces and materials. ISO containers are often wind and leak‑proof by virtue of their uses in logistics and shipping. Nearly all units are made from steel, which is a low‑cost, durable material.
Security: a variety of enhanced locking mechanisms are available for portable storage units, including our patented Tri‑Cam Locking System® and ContainerGuardLock®. These features offer additional protection for high‑value goods and inventory.
Convenience: portable storage units provide immediate ground‑level access for consumers and can be easily transported in large quantities via truck, rail, or cargo ship.
Aesthetics: portable storage units can be easily painted and decorated with company colors and logos and are less conspicuous than other portable storage alternatives such as van trailers.
Specialty Containment Market
This market is served by our Tank and Pump Solutions business. In the specialty containment sector, we service different markets: the industrial market, comprised mainly of chemical facilities and refineries, also known as the “downstream” market and, to a lesser extent, companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, or the “upstream” market. Additionally, we serve a diversified group of customers engaged in projects in the construction, pipeline, and mining markets. Downstream customers utilize tank and pump equipment and services to manage and remove liquid and solid waste generated by ongoing operating activities as well as turn‑around projects and large‑scale expansion projects. Upstream customers, who we estimate represent approximately 2% of pro forma rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, tend to rent steel tanks to store and transport water and propellant used in well hydraulic fracturing. Other customers utilize a wide variety of our products differentiated by the type of project in which they are engaged.
Other Related Markets
In the normal course of providing our “Ready to Work” solutions, we perform services that are characteristic of activities in other industries. For example, we coordinate a broad network of third-party and in-house transportation and service resources to support the timely movement of our products to, as well as maintenance on, customer sites. Additionally, we design, source, lease, and maintain a broad offering of ancillary products, including furniture, which render our modular units immediately functional in support of our customers’ needs. We have developed networks of third‑party service providers that we coordinate to expand the breadth of capabilities that our customers can source through us. These third‑party‑managed services represent incremental revenue and margin opportunities for us and simplify the number of vendor touchpoints for our customers.
We also provide technical expertise and oversight for customers regarding building design and permitting, site preparation, and expansion or contraction of installed space based on changes in project requirements. Further, we have the capability to compete in adjacent markets, such as commercial and institutional housing, which have received less focus historically in the modular space market. We believe that this broad service capability differentiates us from other rental and business services providers and clearly differentiates us in the marketplace.
Competition
Although our competition varies significantly by local market, the modular space and portable storage industry is highly competitive and fragmented as a whole. We believe that participants in our industry compete on the basis of customer 
relationships, product quality and availability, delivery speed, VAPS and service capabilities, pricing, and overall ease of doing business. We typically compete with one or more local providers in all of our markets, as well as with a limited number of national and regional companies. 
Our competitors include lessors of storage units, mobile offices, van trailers, and other structures used for portable storage. As a provider of portable storage, we also compete with conventional fixed self-storage facilities. Some of our competitors may have greater market share in certain geographic regions. Significant modular space and portable storage competitors include McGrath RentCorp, PODS, Pac-Van, ATCO Structures & Logistics, BOXX Modular, and 1-800-PACK-RAT in North America, and Wernick Hire and Elliott in the UK. Numerous other regional and local companies compete in individual markets. 
Our Tank and Pump Solutions business offers liquid and solid containment products. The liquid and solid containment industry is also highly fragmented, consisting principally of local providers, with a handful of regional and national providers. We compete based on factors including quality and breadth of equipment, technical applications expertise, knowledgeable and experienced sales and service personnel, on‑time delivery and proactive logistics management, geographic areas serviced, rental rates, and customer service. Our competitors include United Rentals, Rain For Rent, Adler Tanks, Sprint/Republic Services, and numerous other smaller competitors.
Strategic Acquisitions
We believe the scalability of our branch network, corporate and shared services infrastructure, technology, and processes allows us to integrate acquisitions efficiently, realize cost savings, cross-sell VAPS, and improve the yield on acquired assets. As such, we manage an active acquisition pipeline and consider acquisitions to be an important component of our growth strategy. 
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,300 people worldwide, the majority of which are full time. Of these employees, approximately 3,800 are employed in North America, approximately 370 are employed in the UK, and approximately 100 are employed in Mexico. We have collective bargaining agreements in portions of our Mexico-based operations representing approximately 2% of our employees. Approximately 86% of employees work in our branch locations, while 14% serve in various corporate functions. We have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage, and we consider our relations with the labor unions and employees to be good. 
Our Chief Human Resources Officer along with other members of our executive leadership team develop and execute our human capital strategy. This includes attracting, acquiring, developing and engaging talent to deliver our strategy, designing employee compensation and benefits programs, and developing and integrating our inclusion and diversity ("I&D") initiatives.
Company Values
We believe that our people are our most valuable asset. Our company values are lived through our employees, acknowledged by our vendors and aligned to the needs of our customers and communities. We are:
Dedicated to Health & Safety: We are subject to certain environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations in countries, states or provinces, and localities in which we operate. Our health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of our operations. We take responsibility for our own well-being and for those around us. Health and safety are first, last and everything in-between.
Committed to Inclusion & Diversity: We are stronger together when we celebrate our differences and strive for inclusiveness. We believe that a rich culture of inclusion and diversity enables us to create, develop and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed customer expectations and meet our growth objectives. We encourage collaboration and support the diverse voices and thoughts of our employees and communities.
Driven to Excellence: We measure success through our results and achievement of our goals. We continuously improve ourselves and our products and services in pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.
Trustworthy & Reliable: We hold ourselves accountable to do the right thing especially when nobody’s looking.
Devoted to Our Customers: We anticipate the growing needs of our customers and strive to exceed their expectations and make it easy to do business with us.
Community Focused: We actively engage in the communities we serve and deliver sustainable solutions.
Inclusion and Diversity 
We encourage and empower the diverse voices and contributions of our stakeholders to drive increased market share and global value. In 2020, we established a role in our human resources department to lead our I&D efforts company-wide. Our developing inclusiveness resource teams are established to support our employees and provide opportunities for exposure, development, and contribution to the organization.
Environmental and Social Responsibility and Safety
We are committed to upholding the highest standards when it comes to our environmental and social responsibilities, as well as the safety of our employees and our business partners, which we believe serves as a competitive advantage. We are a sustainable organization with long-lived, reusable and renewable assets that are constantly redeployed to customers with minimal residual environmental impact.
Our policies and practices are evident of our commitment to environmental responsibility and accountability and respect for human rights and fair labor standards. We have a company-wide focus on safety and have implemented numerous measures to promote workplace safety. Customers are increasingly focused on safety records in their sourcing decisions due to increased regulations to report all incidents that occur at their sites and the costs associated with such incidents. Our consolidated Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") remains well below 1.0, demonstrating what we believe to be exceptional performance in the area of workplace safety. TRIR is an important safety metric required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA").
COVID-19 Safety Protocols 
Our business, along with the rest of the world, faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. We remained dedicated to protecting the health and safety of our employees, vendors, and customers and adjusted our business to meet various country, state, and local requirements. We are considered an “essential business” and our employees are considered “essential workers”. We have continued to service our customers throughout the pandemic, while implementing robust health and safety protocols to protect our employees and customers, and we believe these robust protocols have differentiated us as a sophisticated partner in the eyes of our more demanding customer segments. 
We follow US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or applicable country, state and local guidelines at the locations where we operate. To comply with public health guidance and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, employees are required, prior to commencing work at our facilities and offices each day, to check their temperature and complete a daily symptom certification that is documented and reviewed by our COVID-19 team members. We provide masks and hand sanitizer to our employees, as well as require adherence to appropriate social distancing practices and regularly recurring cleaning/sanitization protocols at our locations. COVID-19 testing for employees is covered by insurance and we actively track key COVID-19 metrics. We have also deployed robust remote-work capabilities and technology across the workforce providing employees flexibility to operate when not required to be on-site at a company location.
Health & Wellness
The health and wellness of our employees is an extremely important facet of our workplace environment. We offer several health and wellness incentives to our employees. Our employee assistance program ("EAP") provides a variety of services to employees in need and was especially important during 2020 as COVID-19 impacted our workforce in different ways. We responded to the pandemic by continuing to prioritize employee health and safety as we conducted our business.
Employee Engagement
We believe that engaged employees are vital to continued business success. As such, we provide consistent touchpoints with employees to ensure that we have a strong understanding of employee sentiment. We have creative programming throughout the year designed to provide engagement opportunities for our workforce that unifies us, even as physical distance separates us. These touchpoints became increasingly more important in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Talent and Recruitment
We work diligently to attract top talent from a variety of sources to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our collaborative working environment, shared commitment to our company values. We strive to balance the recruitment of best-in-class external resources with the development and advancement of our in-house talent to foster a rich diversity of skills and perspectives, which we believe is an important source of competitive advantage.
Community and Partnering
We are proud to make a difference in places that we live and work. We strive to help our communities and hometowns by giving our time and talent to improve our surroundings. Our employees are encouraged to utilize up to 16 hours of paid time off to volunteer in their local communities. We have numerous partnerships with charitable organizations across the country that allow our employees to get involved and give back. Many of our senior leaders serve on boards of non-profit organizations. In 2020, we and our employees generously gave over $420,000 to a variety of causes that improve and advance our local communities.
Total Rewards or Pay Equity
We provide market competitive compensation and benefit packages to our employees. Beyond base compensation, we also offer short and long-term incentive programs, 401(k) with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave and tuition reimbursement among others (programs may vary by country/region, job level, and time with the organization). We obtain annual employee feedback on the 
benefits we offer to ensure that we continue to offer competitive packages that appeal to top talent and allow us to recruit and retain our human capital.
Intellectual Property
We operate primarily under the WillScot and Mobile Mini brands. We protect our products and services through the use of trademarks and patents, none of which are individually material to our business. Our trademarks and patents are registered or pending applications for registrations in the US Patent and Trademark Office and various non‑US jurisdictions. On our Modular fleet, we maintain a patent for the design of our Flex units in the US and other patents in the US and non-US jurisdictions concerning various assembly and panel components. We believe that Flex represents the most innovative and versatile purpose built modular space in the industry, which has helped us expand commercially into new end markets. On our Storage fleet, we have patented our proprietary Tri‑Cam Locking System®, ContainerGuardLock® and other continued improvements in locking technology in the markets in which we operate, as well as in Europe and China. We believe that continued innovation differentiates WillScot Mobile Mini with our customers and represents a source of long-term competitive advantage.
Recent Developments
Mobile Mini Merger 
On July 1, 2020, we closed the Merger at which time Mobile Mini became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WillScot. Concurrent with the closing of the Merger, we changed our name to WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. We believe that the Merger is resulting in strategic and financial benefits by combining the two industry leaders in the complementary modular space and portable storage solutions markets. We are executing the integration of the two companies' operating and financial systems, with a significant portion of these efforts being focused currently on the conversion of the combined company onto a single enterprise resource planning system, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2021. 
Reportable Segments
Following the Merger, we modified our management structure and expanded from two reporting segments to four reporting segments: NA Modular, NA Storage, UK Storage, and Tank and Pump. Prior to the Merger, WillScot had two reporting segments, US Modular and Other North America Modular. These two segments were combined to create the new NA Modular segment, which represents the legacy WillScot operations. The other new segments, NA Storage, UK Storage, and Tank and Pump align to the legacy operations and segments reported by Mobile Mini. The new reporting segments are aligned with how we operate and analyze our business results.
Financing Activities
In anticipation of the Merger, on June 15, 2020, WillScot completed a private offering of $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2025 (the “2025 Secured Notes”). The offering proceeds from the 2025 Secured Notes of $650.0 million were used to repay the 7.875% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “2022 Secured Notes”), repay Mobile Mini senior notes and pay certain fees and expenses related to the Merger and financing transactions. 
On July 1, 2020, in connection with the completion of the Merger, we entered into a new asset-based credit agreement (the "2020 ABL Facility"), that provides for revolving credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of up to $2.4 billion. Proceeds from the 2020 ABL Facility of $1.5 billion were used to repay the WillScot 2017 ABL facility, the Mobile Mini line of credit, and fees and expenses related to the Merger and financing transactions. The 2020 ABL Facility matures July 1, 2025.
On August 11, 2020, we redeemed $49.0 million of our 6.875% senior secured notes (the “2023 Secured Notes”) at a redemption price of 103.0% plus accrued and unpaid interest. This repayment was funded by the 2020 ABL facility. 
On August 25, 2020, we completed a private offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior secured notes due 2028 (the “2028 Secured Notes”). Proceeds from the 2028 Secured Notes were used to repay the $441.0 million remaining outstanding principal of the 2023 Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103.438% plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Sapphire Exchange
  On June 30, 2020, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Sapphire Holding S.à r.l. (“Sapphire Holdings”), our largest shareholder, which is controlled by TDR Capital LLP (“TDR Capital”), exchanged (the “Sapphire Exchange”) each of its shares of common stock of Williams Scotsman Holdings Corp. ("Holdings"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to an existing exchange agreement between WillScot and Sapphire Holdings, for 1.3261 shares of newly issued WillScot Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”). As a result of the Sapphire Exchange, all issued and outstanding shares of WillScot’s Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, were automatically canceled for no consideration and the existing exchange agreement was automatically terminated. As a result of the Sapphire Exchange, Sapphire Holdings received 10,641,182 shares of Class A Common Stock.
Share Conversion 
In connection with the Merger, on July 1, 2020, WillScot issued 106,426,722 shares of its Class A Common Stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of common stock of Mobile Mini, par value $0.01 per share, and subsequently filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which reclassified all outstanding shares of the Class A Common Stock and converted such shares into shares of Common Stock, par value of $0.0001 per share, of WillScot Mobile Mini. 
COVID‑19 impact on business
Since the outbreak of COVID‑19 was designated as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) in March 2020, our operations have generally continued to operate normally, albeit at lower activity levels in the second and third quarters of 2020, and with additional safety protocols in place as we have been considered an essential business in most jurisdictions. However, there have been significant changes to the global economic situation as a consequence of the COVID‑19 pandemic. The global pandemic has resulted in significant global social and business disruption, and in response we have modified the way we communicate and conduct business with our customers, suppliers, and employees. 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, financial results for our operations were impacted by the COVID‑19 pandemic as we experienced reduced demand, particularly in the second and third quarters of the year. During this time, a portion of new project deliveries from our customers were either cancelled or delayed as a result of the COVID‑19 pandemic, and it remains unclear as to what extent such disruptions may impact our financial results in the future. On a pro forma basis, our deliveries were down 25% in the second quarter year over year and 13% in the third quarter year over year due to reduced demand primarily attributable to the current global economic situation as a consequence of the COVID‑19 pandemic. However, these impacts moderated in the fourth quarter and demand rebounded with deliveries up 2% year over year in the fourth quarter and up 0.3% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2020. Furthermore, reduced delivery activity was substantially offset by reduced lease terminations which were approximately 19% below 2019 levels in the second and third quarters which helped stabilize our units on rent. Though recent demand has improved, the reduced delivery demand during the the second and third quarters of 2020 caused us to reduce variable costs and capital spending during those periods. These actions contributed to expanded profitability and cash flow in these periods, and activity levels and costs began to normalize heading into the fourth quarter. Despite this unprecedented demand shock, our long lease durations, our predictable cash inflows, and the fact that the majority of our gross profit in any given period is from units already out on rent, we believe we have visibility into our future cash flows and are able to plan ahead to adjust for varying demand levels.
The following summarizes many of the key actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
Employee safety and health
We have implemented various employee safety measures to contain the spread of COVID‑19, including domestic and international travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing and work‑from‑home practices, extensive cleaning protocols, daily symptom assessments, and enhanced use of personal protective equipment such as masks. We continue to closely monitor all guidance provided by applicable government agencies to ensure the safety of our employees, vendors, and customers as our top priority.
Sales and leasing operations
We continue to monitor government restrictions, which vary significantly across our geographic markets. As a result of the shelter‑in‑place orders and increased social distancing measures, some of our markets, such as special events and sports and entertainment, have experienced sustained reductions in demand for new projects. Other sectors, such as health care, have experienced increased demand, while other sectors such as construction have remained active but with varying degrees of project disruption, some of which are quite significant. We are also responding to demand across our end markets from customers in need of additional office space to facilitate social distancing. As we serve many critical sectors of the economy, we will continue to help support customers who remain operational, as well as those who are actively engaged in the COVID-19 response. We believe that our branch locations are considered essential businesses in most jurisdictions and as such have continued to operate normally with the aforementioned safety protocols in place, while our customer service and sales teams are working closely with customers to meet current demand.
Available Information
Our website address is www.willscotmobilemini.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC maintains an internet website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding WillScot Mobile Mini.
Regulatory and Environmental Compliance
We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import control, health and safety, and other laws and regulations in countries, states or provinces, and localities in which we operate. We incur significant costs in our business to comply with these laws and regulations. However, from time to time we may be subject to additional costs and 
penalties as a result of non-compliance. The discovery of currently unknown matters or conditions, new laws and regulations, or different enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could materially harm our business or operations in the future.
We are subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities that may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. As of the date of this filing, no environmental matter has been material to our operations. Based on our management’s assessment, we believe that any environmental matters relating to us of which we are currently aware will not be material to our overall business or financial condition.
The jurisdictions in which we operate are also subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”). These regulations prevent companies and their officers, employees, and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal sanctions and significant monetary penalties.
Certain of our units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations and certificate of title statutes. Management believes that the Company has complied, in all material respects, with all motor vehicle registration and similar certificate of title statutes in states where such statutes clearly apply to modular space units. We have not taken actions under such statutes in states where we have determined that such statutes do not apply to modular space units. However, in certain states, the applicability of such statutes to modular space units is not clear beyond doubt. If additional registration and related requirements are deemed to be necessary in such states or if the laws in such states or other states were to change to require us to comply with such requirements, we could be subject to additional costs, fees, and taxes as well as administrative burdens in order to comply with such statutes and requirements. Management does not believe that the effect of such compliance will be material to our business or financial condition.
