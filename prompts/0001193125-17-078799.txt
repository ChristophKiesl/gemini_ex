 General 
 VASCO designs, develops and markets digital solutions for identity, security and business productivity that protect and facilitate transactions online, via mobile devices, and in-person. VASCO is a global leader in providing anti-fraud and digital transaction management solutions to financial institutions and other businesses. VASCO solutions secure access to data, assets, and applications for global enterprises; provide tools for application developers to easily integrate security functions into their web-based and mobile applications; and facilitate digital transactions involving the signing, sending, and managing of documents. Our core technologies, multi-factor authentication (also known as MFA) and transaction signing, strengthen the process of preventing hacking attacks against online and mobile transactions to allow companies to transact business safely with remote customers. Multi-factor authentication is the process of using multiple user attributes to confirm that the user is who they claim to be. This can include the users knowledge, such as a user name or password, what the user possesses, such as a hardware or software token, and who the user is, such is a fingerprint or facial attributes. 
 VASCOs solutions include both open standards-based and proprietary solutions, some of which are patented products and services used for authentication, e-signing transactions and documents, and identity management in Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Employee (B2E) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) environments. 
 Historically, we have focused on two target market segments, the banking and/or financial services market (which we refer to as the Banking Market or Banking) and the enterprise and application security market (which we have referred to as the Enterprise and Application Security Market or Enterprise and Application Security). Our target markets include, but are not limited to, applications where individuals access assets and information, and complete transactions that have significant value. 
 In this increasingly connected world, online and mobile application owners and users benefit from our expertise in multi-factor authentication, transaction signing, and application security. Our convenient and proven security solutions enable frictionless and trusted interactions between businesses, employees, and consumers across a variety of online and mobile platforms. 
 
2 
 
In order to succeed in this rapidly evolving market, VASCO has developed a growth strategy. Our strategy includes the following: 
 Bringing the next generation of online and mobile security solutions and electronic signature technologies to our customers to coincide with their business needs and refresh cycles; 
 Driving increased demand for our products in new applications, new markets, and new territories; 
 Benefitting from the shift to cloud-based and mobile device technologies; 
 Pursuing opportunities to grow our client base in vertical market segments beyond our core business; and 
 Acquiring technology companies that expand our technology portfolio or our customer base, and allow us to achieve our business objectives. 
 Our newest product offerings enhance our library of mobile application security solutions, expand our risk-based anti-fraud capabilities, and deliver broad-based signature capabilities that enable secure and simple digitized business transactions. 
 The number of people using the internet via computers, tablets, and smartphones continues to grow at a rapid pace. Consumers are embracing online and mobile transactions and banking in increasing numbers. Organizations of all types have an increasing number of employees and business partners accessing protected resources from remote locations. New business paradigms such as these introduce new security risks for all participants, especially banks, merchants, and all types of online and mobile service providers. Large and powerful criminal hacking organizations are launching more sophisticated hacking attacks with greater frequency. The criminal activities of private and state-sponsored hacking organizations have driven an increased need for security solutions and the expansion of regulations requiring organizations to improve their security measures to protect against hacking attacks and breaches. Several governments worldwide have recognized the risk associated with using the outdated user name and password access scheme for internet applications and mobile applications and have issued specific recommendations advocating multi-factor authentication for enhanced online and mobile banking security. We anticipate that this trend may continue and that governments in additional countries could prepare similar guidance or rules in order to protect their citizens online assets. 
 Our Background 
 Our predecessor company, VASCO Corp., entered the data security business in 1991 through the acquisition of a controlling interest in ThumbScan, Inc., which we renamed as VASCO Data Security, Inc. 
 In 1996, we expanded our computer security business by acquiring Lintel Security NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which included assets associated with the development of security tokens and security technologies for personal computers and computer networks. Also in 1996, we acquired Digipass NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which was also a developer of security tokens and security technologies and whose name we changed to VASCO Data Security NV/SA in 1997. 
 In 1997, VASCO Data Security International, Inc. was incorporated and in 1998, we completed a registered exchange offer with the holders of the outstanding securities of VASCO Corp. 
 In 2006, we opened our international headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In 2007, we established wholly owned sales subsidiaries in Brazil and Japan. 
 In 2008 and 2009, we established wholly-owned sales subsidiaries in Mumbai, India and Bahrain, respectively. 
 
3 
 
In 2011, we completed the establishment of our wholly-owned sales subsidiary in China and received our trade license for a new subsidiary in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
 In 2013, we acquired Cronto Limited (CRONTO), a provider of secure visual transaction authentication solutions for online banking. CRONTOs patented solution offers a robust, yet simple way to assure that a financial transaction has not been compromised, or hacked. The CRONTO solution has been integrated into VACMAN Controller and IDENTIKEY Server, VASCOs security platforms that support VASCOs entire family of strong authentication and e-signature products. 
 In 2014, we acquired Risk IDS, a provider of risk analysis solutions to the banking community. The platform is designed to evaluate the profile and activities of the user requesting a transaction to determine the risk profile associated with the transaction. It features a real-time analysis engine that uses rules and statistical techniques to improve real-time fraud detection. The technology is incorporated into our IDENTIKEY Risk Manager solution and is also being utilized in our DIGIPASS for Apps solutions. 
 In November 2015, we acquired Silanis Technology Inc., a leading provider of Electronic Signature (e-signature) and digital transaction solutions used to sign, send and manage documents. eSignLive is trusted by many of the largest banks, insurers and government agencies.
 Including our predecessor company, VASCO Corp., we have engaged in fifteen acquisitions and one disposition. 
 Our Approach 
 VASCO is a global leader in delivering trust and business productivity solutions to the digital market. VASCO develops next generation technologies that enable more than 10,000 customers in 100 countries in financial, enterprise, government, healthcare, and other segments to support their transition to digital business processes, deliver an enhanced customer experience, and meet regulatory requirements. We believe that solutions for authentication, electronic signature, and identity management that protect access to financial accounts and internal and cloud applications, as well as the integrity of transactions, must be broad in scope and address all of the critical aspects of stopping fraud and enhancing user convenience. The market requirements for security and business enablement continue to evolve and we are responding by expanding our solutions beyond traditional online anti-fraud solutions to include more channels such as mobile and ATM security. We believe that effective security and productivity solutions must address and assimilate issues relating to the following: 

 | Providing protection against the newest and most sophisticated hacking attacks
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Speed and ease of implementation, use, and administration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Reliability and scalability;
--+-----------------------------


 | Interoperability within diverse applications in the mobile ecosystem;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Convenient and frictionless end user experience; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | Overall cost of ownership.
--+---------------------------

 Accordingly, we have adopted the following approach to designing our products: 
 

 | Where appropriate, we incorporate industry-accepted, open and non-proprietary protocols. This permits interoperability between our products and multiple platforms, products, and applications widely in use. We minimize the effort required for implementation and integration with existing legacy applications and infrastructure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We try to offer a more attractive total cost of ownership than competing products and services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We support a wide variety of devices used to gain access to applications through the internet including personal computers, smart phones, tablets, and other personal devices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 
 

 | We develop products that are designed to provide both ease of use and the strength needed to protect transactions. Some of our client products use our CRONTO visual authentication solution that allows a user to minimize key strokes by optically scanning an encrypted color bar code that may be encrypted, thus increasing the strength of the security being used.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We provide multiple choices to our customers for hardware products and software solutions, both on-premises and in the cloud.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Products and Services 
 Our product offerings, which include authentication, anti-fraud, and electronic signature solutions, provide a flexible and affordable means of establishing trust in users, their devices, and the transactions that they are conducting. Many of our authentication products calculate dynamic passwords, also known as one-time passwords (OTP) that authenticate users logging into applications and onto corporate networks. In addition, our anti-fraud products can be used to enable electronic signatures to protect electronic transactions and the integrity of the contents of such transactions. 
 Using our solutions to access protected applications, electronically sign a transaction, or enter a remote system, the user needs the following: 
 

 | Knowledge of either a username or a PIN code; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | An authenticator, either a DIGIPASS hardware authenticator or a DIGIPASS software authenticator downloaded onto a compatible device owned by the user.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Both factors help ensure that the correct person is being granted access to an application, protected data, or signing a transaction, instead of a hacker. This helps reduce fraud and protect valuable assets. 
 VASCOs primary product and service lines can be used by customers in several ways and consists of four categories: 
 

 | On-premises Solutions, which are typically a component of an organizations IT infrastructure;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Client-based anti-fraud solutions, which are most often used by end users for authentication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cloud solutions which provide our solutions and are managed by VASCO; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Developer Tools, which are used by application developers to increase the security of their mobile applications.

Detailed Product Descriptions 
 VACMAN Controller 
 The VACMAN product line incorporates a range of strong authentication utilities and solutions designed to allow organizations to add DIGIPASS strong authentication into their existing networks and applications. 
 In order to provide the greatest flexibility, without compromising functionality or security, VACMAN solutions are designed to integrate with most popular hardware and software. Once integrated, the VACMAN components become largely transparent to the users, minimizing rollout and support issues. 
 VACMAN encompasses multiple authentication technologies (passwords, dynamic password technologies, certificates, and biometrics) and allows our customers to use any combination of those technologies simultaneously. 
 Designed by specialists in system access security, VACMAN makes it easy to administer a high level of access control and allows our customers to match the level of authentication security used with the risk for each user of their application. Our customer simply adds a field to his or her existing user database, describing the authentication technology used and, if applicable, the unique DIGIPASS assigned to the end user of their application. VACMAN is a library requiring only a few days to implement in most systems and supports all DIGIPASS functionality. Once linked to an application, VACMAN automatically handles login requests from any user authorized to have a DIGIPASS. 
 IDENTIKEY Authentication Server 
 IDENTIKEY Authentication Server is a centralized authentication server that supports the deployment, use, and administration of DIGIPASS strong user authentication. IDENTIKEY is based on VASCOs core VACMAN technology. 
 IDENTIKEY Authentication Server is available in a Banking Edition and three versions for the Enterprise and Application Security market that can be easily upgraded. 
 
6 
 
The Banking Edition provides robust protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, the highest security, and verified fit into existing PCI-DSS environments without reducing compliance. 
 IDENTIKEY Appliance and IDENTIKEY Virtual Appliance 
 IDENTIKEY Appliance is a standalone authentication solution that offers strong two-factor authentication for remote access to a corporate network or to web-based in-house business applications. It comes in a 19 inch rack mount design. The appliance verifies DIGIPASS/IDENTIKEY authentication requests from RADIUS clients and web filters and can easily be integrated with any infrastructure. It features a web-based administration interface as well as an auditing and reporting console. 
 IDENTIKEY Virtual Appliance is a virtualized authentication appliance that secures remote access to corporate networks and web-based applications. 
 IDENTIKEY Federation Server 
 IDENTIKEY Federation Server is a server appliance that provides an identity and access management platform. It is used to validate user credentials across multiple applications and disparate networks. The solution validates users and creates an identity ticket enabling web single sign-on for different applications across organizational boundaries. IDENTIKEY Federation Server works as an Identity Provider within the local organization, but can also delegate authentication requests (for unknown users) to other Identity Providers. In a Federated Model, IDENTIKEY Federation Server not only delegates but also receives authentication requests from other Identity Providers, when local users want to access applications from other organizations within the same federated infrastructure. 
IDENTIKEY Risk Manager: 
 IDENTIKEY Risk Manager (IRM) is a comprehensive anti-fraud solution designed to help banks and other users improve the manner and speed of detecting fraud across multiple channels. It enables banks and financial institutions to take a proactive approach to fraud prevention, while at the same time making the experience frictionless for their end users. IRM uses analytic techniques such as Neural Network implementations to score real-time transaction activity. Cross-channel prebuilt rules complement this score and allow fraud experts to make decisions on alerts or link to automated business processes such as Step-Up Authentication. This solution may be implemented in combination with our DIGIPASS for Apps to provide integrated trust with minimal impact on the end user experience. These products are targeted at banks, transaction processors, and ATM operations. 
DIGIPASS Hardware Authenticators 
 We offer a wide variety of DIGIPASS authenticators, each of which has its own distinct characteristics to meet the needs of our customers. All models of the DIGIPASS family are designed to work together so that our customers can switch their users devices without requiring any changes to their existing infrastructure. Our hardware DIGIPASS models range from simple one-button devices to devices that include more secure technologies, such as PKI. 
 With the acquisition of CRONTO in May 2013, VASCO has also added visual cryptography to its product portfolio. Sensitive transaction data are captured in a cryptogram that consists of a matrix of colored dots. By scanning the image with a hardware or software authenticator, the data contained in the cryptogram is decrypted and the transaction details are presented to the user for verification providing a highly secure method of visual transaction signing with maximum user convenience. 
 Many DIGIPASS hardware authenticators also combine the benefits of traditional password authenticators (authentication and digital signatures) with smart card readers. Together, they bring portability to smart cards and allow the use of secure time-based algorithms. 
 
7 
 
DIGIPASS hardware technology is designed to support authentication and digital signatures for applications running on desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, and smart phones. 
 DIGIPASS Software Authenticators 
 Our DIGIPASS Software authenticators, DIGIPASS for Apps and DIGIPASS for Mobile are designed to provide our customers with increased security for access to their mobile applications and networks without having to carry a standalone hardware device. DIGIPASS software authenticators balance the need for stronger mobile application security with the demands for user convenience by delivering comprehensive, built-in security for mobile applications, combined with a frictionless, hands-free authentication and e-signing experience for mobile users. 
 DIGIPASS for Apps is a comprehensive software development kit (SDK) that allows application developers to natively integrate security features including geolocation, device identification, jailbreak and root detection, fingerprint and face recognition, one-time password delivery via PUSH notification, and electronic signing, among others. Through a comprehensive library of APIs, application developers can extend and strengthen application security, deliver enhanced convenience to their application users, and streamline application deployment and lifecycle management processes. 
 DIGIPASS for Mobile is a user-friendly and secure mobile authenticator that operates as a discrete mobile application. It includes many of the features of DIGIPASS for Apps and can easily be tailored to meet the needs of any authentication process. It can be customized and deployed rapidly without extensive technical support ensuring strong security with compelling value. 
 Developer Tools 
 VASCOs Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), proactively addresses the threat of sophisticated malware, by effectively detecting and preventing fraudulent app activities before they interfere with or corrupt the normal operation of a mobile application. RASP also provides code obfuscation to deter debugging and reverse engineering of applications by hackers and reduces the risk of rogue apps. 
 eSignLive e-signature: 
 eSignLive supports a broad range of e-signature requirements from the simple to the complex, and from the occasional electronic contract to processing tens of thousands of transactions. eSignLive provides multiple deployment options including public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises, without compromising on security or functionality. eSignLive is also available in a FedRAMP SaaS-level compliant cloud. U.S. government agencies can now implement e-signatures in the cloud and meet GSA security requirements. Customers can fully configure the e-signature end-user experience to reinforce their brand for a seamless signing experience. 
 eSignLive is a well-established solution with an optimal e-signing experience across multiple devices, including laptop, mobile phone, or tablet, contributing to high levels of user adoption and satisfaction. Each step of the e-signature workflow may be customized, from authentication to e-document distribution, to ensure a high level of signer satisfaction across multiple channels. 
 eSignLive provides the most comprehensive and secure electronic evidence for the strongest legal protection by capturing both document and process-level evidence. This reduces the time and cost of gathering evidence and demonstrating legal and regulatory compliance. eSignLive electronic signature capabilities can be a critical component of the customer onboarding process for mobile applications providing a secure, user friendly and legal manner for financial institutions and others to capture customers signature and instantly add new customers.

MYDIGIPASS Cloud Services 
 MYDIGIPASS (MDP) is our cloud-based service offering with a focus on the needs of B2B and B2C. MDP facilitates password management while adding an additional level of security to the login procedure. By using our MDP platform, consumers using B2C applications have convenient access to these applications with increased security. The MDP platform may also provide benefits for eGovernment and eID applications by providing authentication for citizens that are accessing government applications online. 
 We launched MYDIGIPASS (MDP) in April 2012. MDP is directed at the e-government and B2B market. This solution enables users to securely access multiple applications with only one DIGIPASS. We believe that with this approach, we can bring the security of multifactor authentication to a large number of online applications. 
 The combination of our core business line and service offering brings a large number of online applications within VASCOs reach. MDP may have the potential for future growth as it has the capability of facilitating identity proofing and making authentication more affordable and readily available to users. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, design and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights. In particular, we hold several patents in the U.S. and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. These patents expire between 2021 and 2034. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe and other countries. The majority of our issued and pending patents cover our DIGIPASS family and other authentication related technology. We believe these patents to be valuable property rights and we rely on the strength of our patents and on trade secret law to protect our proprietary technology. We furthermore have registrations for most of our trademarks in most of the markets where we sell the corresponding products and services and registrations of the designs of many of our hardware products primarily in the EU and China. To the extent that we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed upon, we intend to assert vigorously our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, pursuing all available legal remedies. 
Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts historically have been, and will continue to be, concentrated on product enhancement, new technology development, and related new product introductions. We employ a team of full-time engineers and, from time to time, also engage independent engineering firms to conduct non-strategic product development efforts on our behalf. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we incurred expenses of $23.2 million, $17.5 million, and $18.5 million, respectively, for research and development. 
Production 
 Our security hardware DIGIPASS products are manufactured by third party manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we issue. Our hardware DIGIPASS products are made primarily from commercially available electronic components purchased globally. Our software products, are produced in-house. 
 Hardware DIGIPASS products utilize commercially available programmable microprocessors purchased from several suppliers. The microprocessors are the most important components of our security authenticators that are not commodity items readily available on the open market. Some microprocessors are single sourced. Orders of microprocessors generally require a lead-time of 12-16 weeks. We attempt to maintain a sufficient inventory of all parts to handle short-term increases in orders. 
 
9 
 
Large orders that would significantly deplete our inventory are typically required to be placed with more than twelve weeks of lead-time, allowing us to make appropriate arrangements with our suppliers. We purchase microprocessors and arrange for shipment to third parties for assembly and testing in accordance with our design specifications. The majority of our DIGIPASS products are manufactured by four independent vendors domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau with production facilities in mainland China. Purchases from these companies are made on a volume purchase order basis. Equipment designed to test product at the point of assembly is supplied by VASCO. We maintain a local team in China who conduct quality control and quality assurance procedures. Periodic visits are conducted by VASCO personnel for purposes of quality management, assembly process review, and supplier relations. 
 Competition 
 The market for computer and network security solutions is very competitive and, like most technology-driven markets, is subject to rapid change and constantly evolving products and services. Our anti-fraud products are designed to allow authorized users access to a computing environment or application, in some cases using patented technology, as a replacement for or supplement to a static password. Although certain of our security technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer anti-fraud solutions that compete with us for market share. Our main competitors in our anti-fraud markets are Gemalto and RSA Security, a subsidiary of EMC Corporation, which was acquired by Dell Technologies in 2016. There are many other companies, such as Kobil Systems, SafeNet (acquired by Gemalto in 2014), Symantec, and Early Warning that offer competing authentication hardware, software and services that range from simple locking mechanisms to sophisticated encryption technologies. In addition to these companies, we face competition from many small authentication solution providers many of whom offer new technologies and niche solutions such as biometric or behavioral analysis. We believe that competition in this market is likely to intensify as a result of increasing demand for security products. Our primary competitors for electronic signature solutions include DocuSign and Adobe Systems. Both companies are significantly larger then VASCO and outspend VASCO in marketing by a significant amount. In addition to these companies, there are dozens of smaller and regional providers of electronic signing solutions. Visibility of global competitors and their planned actions has diminished over the last several years as some of our competitors have been acquired by larger corporations (e.g., EMCs acquisition of RSA) or private equity firms. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for computer and network security products as well as electronic signatures include the strength and effectiveness of the solution, technical features, ease of use, quality/reliability, customer service and support, brand recognition, customer base, distribution channels, and the total cost of ownership of the solution. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, other than name recognition in certain markets, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors, especially those with significantly greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, and other competitive resources. 
 Some of our present and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing, and other resources than we do, and as a result, may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, or to deliver competitive products at a lower end-user price. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Accordingly, we have forged, and will continue to forge, our own partnerships to offer a broader range of products and capabilities to the market.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our security solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force, as well as through distributors, resellers and systems integrators. Our traditional security solutions are sold through our direct sales force, as well as through approximately 52 distributors, their reseller networks and systems integrators. Our sales staff coordinates sales activity through both our sales channels and those of our strategic partners making direct sales calls either alone or with the sales personnel of our partners. Our sales staff also provides product education seminars to sales and technical personnel of vendors and distributors with whom we have working relationships and to potential end-users of our products. 
 VASCO secures and trains its channel. Approximately 1,200 staff members of our channel partners have become VASCO certified. 
 Our sales force is able to offer each customer a choice of an on-site implementation using our traditional on-premises model or a cloud implementation for some solutions using our services platform. 
 Part of our expanded selling effort includes approaching our existing strategic partners to find additional applications for our security products. In addition, our marketing plan calls for the identification of new business opportunities that may require enhanced security or areas where we do not currently market our products. Our efforts also include various activities to increase market awareness of solutions as well as preparation and dissemination of white papers explaining how our security products can add value or otherwise be beneficial. 
 Customers and Markets 
 Customers for our products include some of the worlds most recognized names: HSBC, Rabobank, Deutsche Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, BNP-Paribas Fortis, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Banco Santander, Citibank, and U.S. government agencies including the Postal Service, USDA and GSA. 
 Our top 10 customers contributed 36%, 50%, and 46%, in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. In 2015 and 2014, Rabobank contributed 30% and 12% of our worldwide revenue, respectively. In addition, in 2014, HSBC contributed approximately 11%, of our worldwide revenue. 
 A significant portion of our sales is denominated in foreign currencies and changes in exchange rates impact results of operations. To mitigate exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against operating expenses being incurred in that currency. For additional information regarding how currency fluctuations can affect our business, please refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 We experience seasonality in our business. Historically, these seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months, particularly in Europe, when many businesses defer purchase decisions; however, the timing of any one or more large orders may temper or offset this seasonality. 
 We generally focus sales and marketing efforts in two primary areas: 
 

 | Banking, which includes Financial Institutions: Traditionally our largest market where we believe that there are substantial opportunities for future growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other verticals, which are a significant market for us and includes:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Businesses seeking secure internal and remote network access: We sell to this market primarily through distributors and resellers. Our strategy is to leverage products developed for the Banking market by selling them to businesses.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 
 

- | E-commerce: Both business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce are becoming ever more important for us.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | E-government: Our customer base includes a significant number of government organizations and we continue to experience positive growth in this market. This is primarily driven by our e-signature solution, eSignLive.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our channel partners are critical to our success. We serve multiple markets via our two-tier indirect sales channel. We invest in and support our channel with training, marketing and sales support resources. Distributors and resellers get the tools they need to be successful, such as campaigns, case studies, marketing funds and more. We train employees of our resellers and distributors on-site and in our offices. 
 Backlog 
 Our backlog at December 31, 2016 was approximately $50 million compared to $51 million at December 31, 2015 and $113 million at December 31, 2014. We do not believe that the specific amount of backlog at any point in time is indicative of the trends in our markets or the expected results of our business. Given the large size of orders, the backlog number can change significantly with the receipt of a new order or modification of an existing order. 
Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations 
 For financial information regarding VASCO, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a single operating segment for all our products and operations. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of revenue and long-lived assets between U.S. and foreign operations. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 613 total employees, which included 589 full-time employees. Of the total employees, 358 are located in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), 154 in Canada, 66 in the U.S., 31 in Asia Pacific and 4 in Latin America. Of the total employees, 299 were involved in sales, marketing, operations and customer support, 229 in research and development and 85 in general and administration. 
  Item 1A - Risk Factors 
 RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors, which we consider the most significant, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, there are a number of less significant and other general risk factors that could affect our future results. If any of the events described in the risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We have grouped our Risk Factors under captions that we believe describe various categories of potential risk. For the readers convenience, we have not duplicated risk factors that could be considered to be included in more than one category.

Risks Related to Our Business 
 A significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits. 
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, many of which are financial institutions. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could adversely affect our operations and results. In fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, our top 10 largest customers contributed 36%, 50%, and 46%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. In 2015 and 2014, Rabobank contributed 30% and 12%, respectively, of total revenue principally due to an order for card readers incorporating our CrontoSign technology. 
 In fiscal 2014, HSBC contributed approximately 11% of total worldwide revenue. HSBC has no long term contractual commitment to purchase products or services from us. HSBC and its affiliates only make purchase commitments pursuant to individual purchase orders placed with us from time to time, which are subject to our acceptance. The general commercial framework that applies to such purchases by HSBC may be terminated by HSBC at any time, without cause, on 90 days notice to us without payment of any termination charge by HSBC. 
 The return of a worldwide recession and/or an increase in the concern over the European sovereign debt crisis may further impact our business. 
 Our business is subject to economic conditions that may fluctuate in the major markets in which we operate. Factors that could cause economic conditions to fluctuate include, without limitation, recession, inflation, deflation, interest rates, unemployment, consumer debt levels, general retail or commercial markets and consumer or business purchasing power or preferences. 
 While it appears that circumstances that led to the sovereign debt crisis have abated, many significant economic issues have not been addressed fully. As a result, we expect that Europe will continue to face difficult economic conditions in 2017. If global economic and financial market conditions remain uncertain and/or weak for an extended period of time, any of the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations: 
 

 | slower consumer or business spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continued volatility in the global markets and fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts or purchase orders in foreign currencies could negatively impact our reported financial results and condition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continued volatility in the prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and ultimately our profitability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | restructurings, reorganizations, consolidations and other corporate events could affect our customers budgets and buying cycles, particularly in the banking industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if our customers experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | in the event of a contraction of our sales, dated inventory may result in a need for increased obsolescence reserves;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13 
 

 | any difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While we believe that many of the effects of the recession and credit crisis have abated, we are unable to predict potential future economic conditions, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, or the effect of any such disruption or disruptions on our business and results of operations, but the consequences may be materially adverse. We believe that our business in the Banking market in Europe would be impacted most directly by any such disruption and that the consequences may be materially adverse, as approximately 52% of our consolidated revenues originated in the EMEA region in 2016. 
 Disruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources. 
 We believe our financial resources and current borrowing arrangements are adequate to meet our operating needs. However, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources and expose us to additional currency fluctuation risk. Sufficiently adverse effects could cause us to modify our business plans. 
 Furthermore, in an adverse economic environment there is a risk that customers may delay their orders until the economic conditions improve further. If a significant number of orders are delayed for an indefinite period of time, our revenue and cash receipts may not be sufficient to meet the operating needs of the business. If this is the case, we may need to significantly reduce our workforce, sell certain of our assets, enter into strategic relationships or business combinations, discontinue some or all of our operations, or take other similar restructuring actions. While we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs, they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenue and cash receipts. It is also likely that we would incur substantial non-recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions. 
 We have had a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting in the past and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future, despite our efforts to remediate the identified weakness. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to comply with our periodic reporting obligations, or accurately report the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of the Companys common stock. 
 Management determined that the Companys internal control and procedures over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 were not effective. The determination was the result of a material weakness in such internal controls at that time related to deficiencies associated with our acquisition of Silanis Technology Inc. in November 2015 and its subsequent operation. This weakness was discovered prior to finalizing our financial statements for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 and did not require us to restate any financial information in this 10K or any prior period reports. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an adverse report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. See Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K for further information. 
 We cannot assure you that an additional material weakness, or significant deficiencies, in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls, or implement new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their maintenance or implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls, and it could cause errors in our financial statements that could in turn lead 
 
14 
 
 to a restatement of those financial statements. In that event, our investors and customers could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the Companys financial results could be adversely affected, the market price of the Companys common stock could decline, and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Companys future access to the capital markets. 
 We have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit. 
 Although we have reported net income of $10.5 million, $42.1 million, and $33.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, our retained earnings were only $179 million at December 31, 2016. Over our 25 year operating history, we have operated at a loss for many of those years. In the current uncertain economic environment, it may be difficult for us to sustain our recent levels of profitability. We may also choose to invest for long term value which could decrease or eliminate short term profit. 
 We derive revenue from a limited number of products and do not have a broadly-diversified product base. 
 A majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of authentication products. We also anticipate that a substantial portion of our future revenue, if any, will also be derived from these products and related services. If the sale of these products and services is impeded for any reason and we have not diversified our product offerings, our business and results of operations would be negatively impacted. This includes a diversification from hardware products to software solutions and related services; which transformation, if not successfully executed, could lead to reduced revenue. 
 The sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated. 
 The sales cycle for our products, which is the period of time between the identification of a potential customer and completion of the sale, is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little control. If revenue falls significantly below anticipated levels, our business would be seriously harmed. 
 A typical sales cycle in the Banking market is often six months or more. Larger Banking transactions may take up to 18 months or more. Purchasing decisions for our products and systems may be subject to delays due to many factors that are not within our control, such as: 
 

 | The time required for a prospective customer to recognize the need for our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The significant expense of many data security products and network systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Customers internal budgeting processes; and
--+---------------------------------------------


 | Internal procedures customers may require for the approval of large purchases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, a small fluctuation in the timing of sales can cause our operating results to vary significantly between periods. 
 We have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations. 
 In the event that the supply of components or finished products is interrupted or relations with any of our principal vendors is terminated, there could be increased costs and considerable delay in finding suitable 
 
15 
 
 replacement sources to manufacture our products. The majority of our products are manufactured by four independent vendors domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau. Our hardware DIGIPASSES are assembled at facilities in mainland China. The importation of these products from China exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China or developments in the United States or European Union that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation. 
 We order processors well in advance of expected use and produce finished goods prior to the receipt of customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to the write down or write off of inventory that cannot be sold at full value. 
 In an attempt to minimize the risk of not having an adequate supply of component parts to meet demand, especially in situations where we have been notified that key processors will no longer be manufactured, we sometimes purchase multiple years supply of processors based on internal forecasts of demand. In addition, to meet customers demands for accelerated delivery of product, we sometimes produce finished product for existing customers before we receive the executed order from the customer. Should our forecasts of future demand be inaccurate or if we produce product that is never ordered, we could incur substantial losses related to the write down or write off of our inventory. 
 Our success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to develop, market, and distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, to incorporate our technology into their products. 
 Part of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and other cooperative arrangements with other companies in our industry. We currently are involved in cooperative efforts with respect to the incorporation of our products into products of others, research and development efforts, marketing efforts and reseller arrangements. None of these relationships are exclusive, and some of our strategic partners also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors. If we are unable to enter cooperative arrangements in the future or if we lose any of our current strategic or cooperative relationships, our business could be harmed. We do not control the time and resources devoted to such activities by parties with whom we have relationships. In addition, we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments, which may adversely affect these relationships. These relationships may not continue, may not be commercially successful, or may require our expenditure of significant financial, personnel and administrative resources from time to time. Further, certain of our products and services compete with the products and services of our strategic partners. 
 We may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue. 
 We rely on both our direct sales force and an indirect channel distribution strategy for the sale and marketing of our products. We may be unable to attract distributors, resellers and integrators, as planned, that can market our products effectively and provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. There is also a risk that some or all of our distributors, resellers or integrators may be acquired, may change their business models or may go out of business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our distributors, integrators and resellers may carry competing lines of products. The loss of important sales personnel, distributors, integrators or resellers could adversely affect us. 
 We depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. 
 Our success and our ability to manage our business depend, in large part, upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a 
 
16 
 
 material adverse effect on our business and operations. It could be difficult for us to find replacements for our key personnel, as competition for such personnel is often intense. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could reduce the market value of our securities. 
 If we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed. 
 Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is often intense and there can be no assurance that we can attract other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected. 
 Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the distribution of income among the various countries in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, changes in share-based compensation expense, and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods; and a reduction in our U.S. tax rate could negatively impact our deferred tax assets which could also adversely impact our net income. 
 Our worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions. 
 Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other taxes such as sales and VAT taxes. There are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany agreements to purchase intellectual properties, allocate revenue and costs, and other factors, each of which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, we cannot be certain that the final tax authority review of these matters will not differ materially from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and other tax accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits, or other tax accruals, in the period in which such determination is made, and consequently, on our results of operations for such period. 
 Changes in global tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 We are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We may be subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess our judgments to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement. Tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. 
 
17 
 
We have operations and sales in a number of European countries, with our international headquarters and legal entity located in Switzerland. The overall tax environment has made it increasingly challenging for multinational corporations like us to operate with certainty about taxation in many jurisdictions. For example, the European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provide preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 13 Table of Contents which represents a coalition of member countries, is supporting changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, a number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. The increasingly complex global tax environment could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Although we expect to be able to rely on tax treaties between and among the United States, Switzerland and other countries where we operate, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaties may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaties. Our inability to rely on the treaties would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Switzerland or other jurisdictions where we operate. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing the United States, Switzerland or these other jurisdictions. 
 Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition or results. 
 We may make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. Should we do so, our failure to successfully structure or manage the acquisitions could seriously harm our financial condition or operating results. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. In connection with our acquisition of eSignLive and any future purchases, we will face additional financial and operational risks, including: 
 

 | Difficulty in assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of acquired companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Disruption in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions and the diversion of managements attention from our existing business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Difficulty in retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Dilution of our stockholders, if we issue equity to fund these transactions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reduced liquidity, increased debt and higher amortization expenses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Assumption of operating losses, increased expenses and liabilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our relationships with existing employees, customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Discovery of unanticipated issues and liabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Failure to meet expected returns; and
--+--------------------------------------


 | Difficulty in maintaining financial reporting and internal control processes needed to be compliant with requirements applicable to companies subject to SEC reporting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Reported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules. 
 Our sales arrangements often include multiple elements, including hardware, services, software, maintenance and support. In addition, we have sold software related arrangements in multiple forms, including perpetual licenses, term based licenses and software-as-a-service, each of which may be treated differently under accounting rules. The accounting rules for such arrangements are complex and subject to change from time to time. Small changes in circumstances could cause wide deviations in the timing of reported revenue. 
 
18 
 
Provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. 
 Our agreements with customers, solution partners and channel partners generally include provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons or for other damages. In addition, we make certain representations and warranties and incur obligations under our contracts in the ordinary course of business, including for items related to data security and potential data breaches. Large indemnity payments or damages resulting from our contractual obligations could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 The evolution of our business requires more complex development, management and go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk. 
 Our increasing focus on developing and marketing a platform of solutions for identity management, authentication, risk analysis, digital processes and related areas requires different and more complex development, management and go-to-market strategies than our historic hardware authentication business alone. We are developing, buying and licensing technology weighted toward software solutions requiring additional skills and investment in research, development, product management and senior management. This transformation strategy is currently in progress and brings with it significant risks related to our choice of solutions to pursue and our ability to execute the strategy successfully. This strategy requires a greater focus on marketing and selling product suites and software solutions rather than selling hardware products for authentication and transaction signing. Consequently, we are developing, and must continue to develop, new strategies for marketing and selling our offerings. In addition, marketing and selling new technologies to enterprises requires significant investment of time and resources in order to train our employees and educate our customers on the benefits of our new product offerings. These investments can be costly and the additional effort required to educate both customers and our own sales force can distract from their efforts to sell existing products and services. 
 Risks Related to the Market 
 We face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer. 
 The market for data security products and services is highly competitive. Our competitors include organizations that provide data security products based upon approaches similar to and different from those that we employ. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. 
 A decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business. 
 The average selling prices for our solution offerings may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures or a change in our mix of products, software and services. In addition, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Furthermore, we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. To maintain or realize our revenue and gross margins, we must continue to develop, or purchase and introduce new products and services that incorporate new technologies or increased functionality. If we experience such pricing pressures or fail to deliver new products and services relevant to our markets, then our revenue and gross margins could decline, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
19 
 
We may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy. 
 Our ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor or creditor interest. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of any financing unattractive. They may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments, defer our product development activities, or delay the introduction of new products. 
 We experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price. 
 In the future, as in the past, our quarterly operating results may vary significantly, resulting in a volatile stock price. Factors affecting our operating results include: 
 

 | The level of competition;
--+--------------------------


 | The size, timing, cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | New product announcements or introductions by competitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Technological changes in the market for data security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Changes in pricing by competitors;
--+-----------------------------------


 | Our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, if at all;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Component costs and availability;
--+----------------------------------


 | Achievement of significant market share in particular markets followed by declines as buying cycles tend to be multiple years apart;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The variability of revenue realized from individual customers as their buying patterns often vary significantly from period to period;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and
--+------------------------------------------------


 | General economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also experience seasonality in all markets. These seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months, particularly in Europe, when many businesses defer purchase decisions. 
 Our stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results. 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following: 
 

 | Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Differences between actual operating results and results estimated by analysts that follow our stock and provide estimates of our results to the market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Differences between guidance relative to financial results, if given, and actual results;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Changes in market valuations of other technology companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
20 
 

 | Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Additions or departures of key personnel;
--+------------------------------------------


 | Future sales of common stock;
--+------------------------------


 | Trading volume fluctuations; and
--+---------------------------------


 | Reactions by investors to uncertainties in the world economy and financial markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control. 
 Our Board of Directors, our officers and their immediate families and related entities beneficially own approximately 24%, with Mr. T. Kendall Hunt beneficially owning approximately 23%, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and our largest stockholder, Mr. Hunt may exercise substantial control over our future direction and operations and such concentration of control may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 
 Certain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult. 
 Our corporate charter and Delaware law contain provisions, such as a class of authorized but unissued preferred stock which may be issued by our board without stockholder approval that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. Delaware law also limits business combinations with interested stockholders. These provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. 
 Future issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control. 
 Our corporate charter authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, including such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors without further stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. 
 Risks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property 
 Technological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue. 
 The introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future revenue growth and operating profit will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop innovative products to distinguish ourselves from the competition and to meet customers changing needs in the data security industry. This also includes our ability to manage our mix of hardware and software based products, as well as develop and maintain a platform of solutions relevant to our markets. Security-related product developments and technology innovations by others may adversely affect our competitive position and we may not successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology, industry standards or customer requirements on a timely basis. 
 
21 
 
Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions. 
 Our use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business: 
 

1. | Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A cyber incident in any of these areas of our business could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver products or services to our customers, cause us to suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm, or substantially impair our ability to grow the business. We expect that there are likely to be hacking attempts intended to impede the performance of our products, disrupt our services and harm our reputation as a company, as the processes used by computer hackers to access or sabotage technology products, services and networks are rapidly evolving in sophistication. 
 In July 2011, we experienced a cyber incident related to DigiNotar B.V. See Part I. Item 3  Legal Proceedings, Part II. Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the hacking incident at DigiNotar B.V., the termination of DigiNotar B.Vs registration as a certification service provider and DigiNotar B.V.s bankruptcy. See Part I. Item 3  Legal Proceedings for a description of legal proceedings related to the cyber security incident at DigiNotar B.V. We may incur additional losses from discontinued operations resulting from these events as a result of unanticipated costs associated with DigiNotar B.V.s bankruptcy and potential claims that may arise in connection with the hacking incidents. 
 Our products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims of infringement. 
 Our products are distributed with software programs licensed to us by third-party authors under open-source licenses, which may include the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser Public License, the BSD License and the Apache License. These open-source software programs include, without limitation, Linux, Apache, Openssl, IPTables, Tcpdump, Postfix, Cyrus, Perl, Squid ,Snort, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Puppet. These third-party, open-source programs are typically licensed to us for no fee and the underlying license agreements generally require us to make available to users the source code for such programs, as well as the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based on these third-party, open-source software programs. 
 We do not believe that we have created any modifications or derivative works to, an extended version of, or works based on, any open-source software programs referenced above. We include instructions to users on how to obtain copies of the relevant open-source code and licenses. 
 We do not provide end users a copy of the source code to our proprietary software because we believe that the manner in which our proprietary software is aligned or communicates with the relevant open-source programs does not create a modification, derivative work or extended version of, or a work based on, that open-source program requiring the distribution of our proprietary source code. 
 
22 
 
Our ability to commercialize our products by incorporating third-party, open-source software may be restricted because, among other reasons: 
 

 | the terms of open-source license agreements are unclear and subject to varying interpretations, which could result in unforeseen obligations regarding our proprietary products or claims of infringement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | it may be difficult to determine the developers of open-source software and whether such licensed software infringes another partys intellectual property rights;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | competitors will have greater access to information by obtaining these open source products, which may help them develop competitive products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | open-source software potentially increases customer support costs because licensees can modify the software and potentially introduce errors.

 We must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development efforts. 
 The market for highly skilled technicians is highly competitive. If we fail to attract, train, assimilate and retain qualified technical personnel for our research and development and product management efforts, we will experience delays or failures in introductions of new or modified products, and services, failures in adequate analysis of technology or acquisitions in the market, loss of clients and market share and a reduction in revenue. 
 We cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful. 
 While management is committed to enhancing our current product offerings and introducing new products, we cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner, and we cannot ensure that any such products will be commercially successful if and when they are introduced. 
 Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business. 
 As part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 SaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business. 
 As we continue to acquire, develop and offer SaaS versions of products, we will need to continue to evolve our processes to meet a number of regulatory, intellectual property, contractual and service compliance challenges. These challenges include compliance with licenses for open source and third party software embedded in our SaaS offerings, maintaining compliance compliance with export control and privacy regulations, including HIPAA, protecting our services from external threats, maintaining the continuous service levels and data security expected by our customers, preventing the inappropriate use of our services and adapting our go-to-market efforts. In addition to using our internal resources, we also utilize third party resources to deliver SaaS offerings, such as third party data hosting vendors. The failure of a third party provider to prevent service disruptions, data losses or security breaches may require us to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur. Additionally, if these third-party providers fail to deliver on their obligations, our reputation could be damaged, our customers could lose confidence in us and our ability to maintain and expand our SaaS offerings. Finally, our SaaS offerings need to 
 
23 
 
 designed to operate at significant transaction volumes. When combined with third party software and hosting infrastructure, our SaaS offerings may not perform as designed which could lead to service disruptions and associated damages. 
 We depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or the successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to divert management attention and could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs. 
 From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with our customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to establish our intellectual property rights and to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk. In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third party software, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results. 
 We rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. We may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. The expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. 
 We hold several patents in the United States and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. The majority of our patents cover the DIGIPASS product line. These patents expire between 2021 and 2035. We do not believe patents expiring in 2017 will affect revenues, profitability, or increase competition. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patents pending in the United States, Europe and other countries. There can be no assurance that we will continue to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that patents of others will not hinder our competitive advantage. For example, our CRONTO patent in Europe was successfully challenged by third parties. This decision has been appealed and the patent remains currently in force, for several more years we believe. However, we may lose our appeals, which could have a significant negative effect on the amount of revenue that we derive related to our CRONTO technology. Although certain of our security token technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer token-type password generators incorporating challenge-response or response-only approaches that employ different technological solutions and compete with us for market share.

We are subject to warranty and product liability risks. 
 A malfunction of or design defect in our products which results in a breach of a customers data security or physical harm or damage from our hardware products could result in tort or warranty claims against us. We seek to reduce the risk of these losses by attempting to negotiate warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements. However, these measures may ultimately prove ineffective in limiting our liability for damages. 
 In addition to any monetary liability for the failure of our products, an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at one of our customers could adversely affect the markets perception of us and our products, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products. Similarly, an actual or perceived breach of network or data security within our own systems could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. 
 There is significant government regulation of technology exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue. 
 Our international sales and operations are subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls, new or changed export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. If we become unable to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis our business in those countries would no longer exist and our revenue would decrease dramatically. Certain of our products are subject to export controls under U.S. law. The list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the regulatory policies with respect thereto, may be revised from time to time and our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could materially and adversely affect our ability to make international sales. Violations of export control and international trade laws could result in penalties, fines, adverse reputational consequences, and other materially adverse consequences. Reference is made to Part 1, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K with respect to the internal investigation regarding sales of VASCO products by a VASCO European subsidiary to a third party distributor which distributor may have resold such products to Iranian entities. 
 We employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations to establish network security systems. 
 Many of our products are based on cryptographic technology. With cryptographic technology, a user is given a key that is required to encrypt and decode messages. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a users key and in part on the application of algorithms, which are advanced mathematical factoring equations. These codes may eventually be broken or become subject to government regulation regarding their use, which would render our technology and products less effective. The occurrence of any one of the following could result in a decline in demand for our technology and products: 
 

 | Any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems, including the development of an easy factoring method or faster, more powerful computers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of keys; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increased government regulation limiting the use, scope or strength of cryptography.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to International Operations 
 We face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue. 
 In 2016, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2015, approximately 95% of our revenue and approximately 65% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. A severe economic decline in any of our major foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition to exposures to changes in the economic conditions of our major foreign markets, we are subject to a number of risks any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue. These include: 
 

 | Inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Export controls relating to our technology;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, including maintaining internal controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potentially adverse tax consequences;
--+--------------------------------------


 | Wage and price controls or protection;
--+---------------------------------------


 | Uncertain protection for intellectual property rights, contractual rights and collecting accounts receivable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Imposition of trade barriers;
--+------------------------------


 | Differing technology standards;
--+--------------------------------


 | Uncertain demand for electronic commerce;
--+------------------------------------------


 | Linguistic and cultural differences;
--+-------------------------------------


 | A widely distributed workforce;
--+--------------------------------


 | Difficulty in providing support and training to customers in certain international locations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Political instability; and
--+---------------------------


 | Social unrest.
--+---------------

 We are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could result in large cash losses. 
 Because a significant number of our principal customers are located outside the United States, we expect that international sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue. We are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks because the majority of our product costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas a significant portion of the sales and expenses of our foreign operating subsidiaries are denominated in various foreign currencies. A decrease in the value of any of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our revenue and profitability in U.S. Dollars of our products sold in these markets. We do not currently hold forward exchange contracts to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. Dollars to offset currency rate fluctuations. 
 We must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards. 
 Governmental regulations setting environmental standards influence the design, components or operation of our products. New regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and, in some 
 
26 
 
 jurisdictions, regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may prevent us from selling our products in a certain country. In addition, these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components. In these cases, we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products, or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance. This could have an adverse effect on our revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results. 
 We are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (also known as the RoHS Directive) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (also known as the WEEE Directive). These directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances. 
 These directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended. 
 The Brexit vote in the United Kingdom may affect our European operations. 
 The Brexit vote in June 2016, and the perceptions related thereto, regarding the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect business activity, political stability, and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and elsewhere. Negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing, or consummation of any such arrangements. The proposed withdrawal could adversely affect the tax, currency, operational, legal, and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. Although we do not have a substantial portion of our operations in, nor derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, the United Kingdom, we do have substantial operations and revenue in the European Union. The United Kingdom withdrawal could disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 We or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change. 
 In addition to the European environmental regulations noted above, we or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, our flow of product may be impacted and/or the costs of handling the potential waste associated with our products may increase dramatically, either of which could result in a significant negative impact on our ability to operate or operate profitably. 
 The effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals and derivatives ( collectively Conflict Minerals) which may originate from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively, Covered Countries). As a result, in August 2012 the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for companies using Conflict Minerals in their products, including products manufactured by third parties. Like many electronic devices, our hardware products contain Conflict Minerals and are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements. Compliance with these rules also requires due diligence including country of origin inquiries to determine the sources of Conflict Minerals used in our products. 
 
27 
 
As required, we filed our annual reports related to products manufactured in calendar 2015, 2014 and 2013. We reported that we determined we had no reason to believe Conflict Minerals used in our products may have originated in Covered Countries. 
 We may incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements. These requirements may affect pricing, sourcing and availability of Conflict Minerals used to produce our devices. We may be unable to verify the origin of all Conflict Minerals in our products. We may encounter challenges with customers and stakeholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. 
 U.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and executives are not located in the United States. 
 Several of our executives and key employees are full-time or part-time residents of foreign countries, and a substantial portion of our assets and those of some of our executives and key employees are located in foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on those persons located in foreign countries, or to enforce judgments against some of our executives and key employees based upon the securities or other laws of jurisdictions in those foreign countries. 
 Our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities. 
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption, particularly certain countries in the Middle East, Africa, East Asia and South America, and further expansion of our international selling efforts may involve additional regions. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or channel partners that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Violations of the U.K. Bribery Act may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition.
