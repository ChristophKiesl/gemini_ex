Overview
Mallinckrodt plc is a global business of multiple wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Mallinckrodt" or "the Company") that develop, manufacture, market and distribute specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies. Areas of focus include autoimmune and rare diseases in specialty areas like neurology, rheumatology, hepatology, nephrology, pulmonology, ophthalmology and oncology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies; analgesics; cultured skin substitutes and gastrointestinal products.
We operate our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below:
•Specialty Brands includes innovative specialty pharmaceutical brands; and
•Specialty Generics includes niche specialty generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API(s)").
We continue to pursue our ongoing transformation to become an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company focused on improving outcomes for underserved patients with severe and critical conditions. For further information on our products, refer to "Our Businesses and Products" within this Item 1. Business.
Our principal executive offices are located at College Business & Technology Park, Cruiserath, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, Ireland, where our Specialty Brands global external manufacturing operations are also located. In addition, we have other locations in the United States ("U.S."), most notably our corporate shared services office in Hazelwood, Missouri, our Specialty Brands commercial headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey (formerly Hampton, New Jersey), and our Specialty Generics headquarters and technical development center in Webster Groves, Missouri.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization
On October 12, 2020 ("Petition Date"), we voluntarily initiated Chapter 11 proceedings ("Chapter 11 Cases") under chapter 11 of title 11 ("Chapter 11") of the United States Code ("Bankruptcy Code") in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ("Bankruptcy Court"). On March 2, 2022, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ("Bankruptcy Court") entered an order confirming the fourth amended plan of reorganization (with technical modifications ("Plan"). Subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, Chapter 11 proceedings commenced by a limited subset of the debtors were recognized and given effect in Canada, and separately the High Court of Ireland made an order confirming a scheme of arrangement on April 27, 2022, which is based on and consistent in all respects with the Plan ("Scheme of Arrangement"). The Plan and Scheme of Arrangement became effective on June 16, 2022, ("Effective Date"), and on such date we emerged from the Chapter 11 and Irish examinership proceedings. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for further information on the Plan and emergence from Chapter 11. 
Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 852 - Reorganizations ("ASC 852"), and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of the Effective Date. References to "Successor" relate to the financial position as of June 16, 2022 and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to June 16, 2022, while references to "Predecessor" relate to the financial position prior to June 16, 2022 and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, June 16, 2022. All emergence-related transactions of the Predecessor were recorded as of June 16, 2022. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the Successor are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for further information.
Fiscal Year
The Company reports its results based on a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of December. The period June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 reflects the Successor period, while the period January 1, 2022 through, and including, June 16, 2022 reflects the Predecessor period. Fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (Predecessor) ("fiscal 2021") consisted of 53 weeks, while the combined periods of January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 and June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 ("fiscal 2022") and fiscal year ended December 25, 2020 (Predecessor) ("fiscal 2020") consisted of 52 weeks.
Our Businesses and Products
We manage our business in two reportable segments: Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics. Management measures and evaluates our operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Information regarding the product portfolios and business strategies of these segments is included in the following discussion. 
Specialty Brands
Our business markets branded pharmaceutical products for autoimmune and rare diseases in the specialty areas of neurology, rheumatology, hepatology, nephrology, pulmonology, ophthalmology and oncology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies; analgesics; cultured skin substitutes and gastrointestinal products. Our diversified, in-line portfolio of both marketed and development products is focused on patients with significant unmet medical needs.
Our long-term strategy is to:
•increase patient access and appropriate utilization of our existing products; 
•develop innovative new therapies and next-generation devices for our products; and 
•selectively acquire or license products that are strategically aligned with our product portfolio to expand the size and profitability of our Specialty Brands segment. 
We promote our branded products directly to physicians in their offices, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers (including neurologists, rheumatologists, hepatologists, nephrologists, pulmonologists, ophthalmologists, oncologists, neonatologists, surgeons and pharmacy directors) with our own direct sales force of almost 300 sales representatives as of December 30, 2022 (Successor). These products are purchased by independent wholesale drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, retail pharmacy chains and hospital procurement departments, among others, and are eventually dispensed by prescription to patients. We also contract directly with payer organizations to ensure reimbursement for our products to patients that are prescribed our products by their physicians. 
The following is a description of select products in our product portfolio:
•Acthar® Gel (repository corticotropin injection) ("Acthar Gel") is a complex mixture of peptides approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for use in 19 indications. The product currently generates substantially all of its net sales from 11 of the on-label indications, including adjunctive therapy for short-term administration for an acute episode or exacerbation in rheumatoid arthritis ("RA"), including juvenile RA; monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children under two years of age; treatment during an exacerbation or as maintenance therapy in selected cases of systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis ("MS") in adults; including a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome ("NS") without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus; treatment during an exacerbation or as maintenance therapy in selected cases of systemic dermatomyositis (polymyositis); treatment of symptomatic sarcoidosis; and treatment of severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye and its adnexa including keratitis and uveitis. The currently approved indications of Acthar Gel are not subject to patent or other exclusivity.
There is significant clinical data generated to support the effectiveness of Acthar Gel. This data is the result of company-sponsored controlled clinical trials, as well as previously completed and largely independent clinical case series and smaller trials that have expanded the product's evidence base and strengthened its clinical profile. We continue our data generation efforts through pre-clinical studies and additional independent research, as well as our efforts to extend the value of the product through product enhancements including the ongoing development of the Acthar Gel self-injection device, which we believe will create an easier and more patient-friendly application for single unit dosage indications. 
•INOmax® (nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation ("INOmax") is a vasodilator that, in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents, is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (>34 weeks) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure ("HRF") associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension. INOmax is also approved in Australia for the treatment of perioperative pulmonary hypertension in adults in conjunction with cardiovascular surgery. Additionally, our Phase 4 registry assessing INOmax for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in premature (27 to 34 weeks) and term and near-term neonates was completed early in February 2020 due to achievement of the pre-specified primary outcome measure of non-inferiority. The decision to end the study early was made following the second planned interim analysis at 75% enrollment. The interim analysis assessed 54 premature and 84 term and near-term neonates and reflected that the trial achieved the significance level for non-inferiority. Evaluation of significant improvement for each neonate is based on at least a 25% decrease in oxygenation index or surrogate oxygenation index during the INOmax treatment period. 
INOmax is marketed as part of the INOmax Total Care package, which includes the drug product, proprietary drug-delivery systems, technical and clinical assistance, 24/7/365 customer service, emergency supply and delivery and on-site training. The development and subsequent FDA submission of a 510(k) premarket notification application was completed in September 2022 for an investigational inhaled nitric oxide delivery system for INOmax gas, for inhalation. If cleared, this next generation inhaled nitric oxide delivery system will offer a compact, portable design that we believe will further enhance the safety of the product, as well as the simplicity and flexibility of use in a number of settings. 
•Therakos® photopheresis ("Therakos") is focused on providing innovative immunotherapy treatment platforms that enhance the ability of a patient's immune system to fight disease. We believe Therakos is a global leader in autologous immunotherapy delivered through extracorporeal photopheresis ("ECP") and provides the only integrated ECP system in the world. ECP involves drawing blood from the patient, separating white blood cells from plasma and red blood cells that are returned to the patient, and treating the white blood cells with an Ultraviolet-A ("UVA") light activated drug. The treated white blood cells are immediately re-administered back into the patient. ECP is approved by the FDA for use in the palliative treatment of the skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ("CTCL") that is unresponsive to other forms of treatment. Outside the U.S., ECP is approved to treat several other serious diseases that arise from immune system imbalances. Therakos' product suite, which is sold to hospitals, clinics, academic centers and blood banks, includes an installed system, a disposable procedural kit used for each treatment and a drug, UVADEX® (methoxsalen) Sterile Solution ("UVADEX"), as well as instrument accessories and instrument maintenance and repair services.
•StrataGraft® (allogenic cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in murine collagen - dsat) ("StrataGraft") regenerative skin tissue is an allogeneic cellularized scaffold product derived from keratinocytes grown on gelled collagen containing dermal fibroblasts indicated for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (deep partial-thickness burns). StrataGraft is designed to deliver viable cells to support the body's own ability to heal. StrataGraft contains metabolically active cells that produce and secrete a variety of growth factors and cytokines. Growth factors and cytokines are known to be involved in wound repair and regeneration. The product is designed with both dermal and epidermal layers composed of well-characterized human cells. StrataGraft is intended to be applied in appropriate aseptic conditions, such as the operating room, and can be sutured, stapled or secured with a tissue adhesive. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we released our first commercial shipment of StrataGraft. The FDA granted StrataGraft orphan drug designation, and it was among the first products designated by the FDA as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. At the time of approval, the FDA awarded us a Priority Review Voucher ("PRV"), which has been sold pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated June 30, 2022. In June 2021, the FDA had approved the StrataGraft biologics license application ("BLA") for deep partial-thickness. We are currently conducting a StrataGraft continued access clinical trial under an expanded access program. The trial sites involved in the pivotal Phase 3 trial have the opportunity to participate in this multicenter, open-label study. Overall, 52 patients were enrolled. There were no unexpected wound or StrataGraft-related events. The safety results were consistent with prescribing information and patients treated achieved durable wound closure without autografting and thus showed expected clinical benefit in this population. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial to evaluate StrataGraft for the treatment of adults with full-thickness burns (also referred to as third-degree burns) and a pediatric study evaluating StrataGraft in the treatment of pediatric populations. 
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA") expressed interest in StrataGraft as a medical countermeasure in response to large-scale burn incidents, and provided funding and technical support for the continued development of StrataGraft. These efforts are part of BARDA's strategy to build emergency preparedness in response to mass casualty events involving trauma and thermal burns by developing novel medical countermeasures for adult and at-risk populations. In the case of a mass casualty thermal burn event, the Government Accountability Office estimates that more than 10,000 patients might require thermal burn care. The limited number of specialized burn centers and related medical infrastructure in the U.S. creates a public health need for therapies that could be deployed quickly for use in these and other care sites.
•Terlivaz® (terlipressin) ("Terlivaz") is the first and only FDA-approved product indicated to improve kidney function in adults with hepatorenal syndrome ("HRS") type 1 (collectively "HRS-1") with rapid reduction in kidney function, an acute and life-threatening condition requiring hospitalization. The FDA granted Terlivaz orphan drug designation. Terlivaz is one of the most studied pharmacological agents in HRS-1 with more than 70 published manuscripts and presented abstracts on clinical data to date. The FDA approval was based, in part, on results from the Phase 3 CONFIRM trial, the largest-ever prospective study (n=300) conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of Terlivaz in patients with HRS-1 in the U.S. and Canada. The CONFIRM trial met its primary endpoint of Verified HRS Reversal, defined as renal function improvement, avoidance of dialysis and short-term survival. It has been approved outside the U.S. for more than 30 years and is available on five continents for its indications in the countries where it is approved. Terlivaz is 
recommended for line use by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines. On September 14, 2022, we announced the FDA had approved Terlivaz for injection and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we released our first commercial shipment of the product.
•Amitiza® (lubiprostone) ("Amitiza") is approved by the FDA for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in women 18 years of age and older, and opioid-induced constipation in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment who do not require frequent opioid dosage escalation. Amitiza is a chloride channel type-two activator that increases fluid secretion and motility of the intestine, facilitating passage of stool. We believe Amitiza is a leading global product in the branded constipation market. Of the branded products currently marketed, only Amitiza is approved for three constipation indications in the U.S.
Specialty Generics
Our Specialty Generics segment is focused on providing our customers high-quality specialty generic drugs and APIs. Specialty Generics include a variety of product formulations containing hydrocodone-containing tablets, oxycodone-containing tablets and several other controlled substances for the treatment of pain. Other controlled substances products include medicines used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD") and addiction treatment medications. Our near-term pipeline in this segment includes the expected launch of several new products in the next few years, with additional products in development long-term. Within this segment, we provide bulk API products, including acetaminophen, mixed amphetamine salts, opioids and stearates, to a wide variety of pharmaceutical companies, many of which are direct competitors of our Specialty Generics finished dosage business. In addition, we use our APIs for internal manufacturing of our finished dosage products.
We are among the world's largest manufacturers of bulk acetaminophen and the only producer of acetaminophen in the North American and European regions with manufacturing facilities exclusively in the U.S. We manufacture controlled substances under the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") quota restrictions, and in calendar 2022, we estimated that we received approximately 36.4% of the total DEA quota provided to the U.S. market for the controlled substances we manufacture. We believe that our market position in the API business and allocation of quota-governed controlled substance materials from the DEA is a competitive advantage for our API business and, in turn, for our Specialty Generics segment. The strategy for our API business is based on manufacturing large volumes of high-quality product and customized product offerings, responsive technical services and timely delivery to our customers.
We market these products principally through independent channels, including drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, retail pharmacy chains, food store chains with pharmacies, pharmaceutical benefit managers that have mail order pharmacies and hospital buying groups.
Research and Development
Specialty Brands. Our research and development ("R&D") resources are primarily devoted to our branded products. Our R&D investments center on supporting our current late-stage product development, maximizing new product launches and accelerating additional lifecycle management opportunities, inclusive of new product enhancements, line extensions and geo-expansions that provide value to patients, physicians and payers. Our strategy focuses on growth, including pipeline opportunities related to late-stage development products to meet the needs of underserved patient populations, where we execute on the development process and perform clinical trials to support regulatory approval of new products. 
Data generation is an important strategic driver for our products, as they extend evidence in approved uses, label enhancements and new indications. Our data strategy is realized through investments in both clinical and health economic activities. We are committed to supporting research that helps advance the understanding and treatment of a variety of different disease states that will further the understanding and development of our currently marketed products, including Acthar Gel, INOmax, Therakos, StrataGraft and Terlivaz.
Specialty Generics. The R&D efforts in this segment are focused on hard-to-manufacture pharmaceuticals with difficult-to-replicate pharmacokinetic profiles and products that would benefit from our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. Our Specialty Generics pipeline consists of a number of products in various stages of development. We currently perform most of our development work at our Specialty Generics headquarters and technical development center in Webster Groves, Missouri.
We are developing a number of complex generic pharmaceutical products that take advantage of our API and drug product manufacturing capabilities as well as our experience in working with API and contract manufacturing organizations. We currently have five Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDA(s)") at various stages of review with the FDA and a diverse portfolio of oral, solid and parenteral formulations under development. Our pipeline is focused on applying our capabilities to develop difficult formulations, utilizing our expertise in working with controlled substances to develop potent products, and expanding both our 
therapeutic and technology platforms into areas with less competitive pressure. We utilize our proven abilities to design around competitor patents to advance both our API and drug product development opportunities and to create our own intellectual property. 
To facilitate our development efforts, we have a multipurpose commercial production facility and pilot plant in St. Louis, Missouri, where we test and scale our manufacturing processes for new products. This also allows us to more rapidly and economically develop certain drug product submissions, all under one roof at our pilot plant, with a limited amount of API or drug product. This facility was converted to dual purpose for both pilot and commercial manufacturing in 2018, and the first product from this facility was approved and launched in 2020.
Competition
Specialty Brands. Certain of our Specialty Brands products do not face direct competition from similar products, but instead compete against alternative forms of treatment that a prescriber may utilize. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our branded products offer not only superior health outcomes but also cost and service advantages, as compared with other forms of care. For example, while there is no therapeutically substitutable generic alternative for Acthar Gel, it faces significant competition from earlier-line treatment alternatives including high-dose steroids, and is generally prescribed when earlier-line treatments have failed to provide positive outcomes or are not well tolerated by the patient. Competition intensified with the commercial launch of a purified cortrophin gel product in 2022, which is a distinct product from Acthar Gel; however, it is in a similar drug class. We experienced pressure from their launch in 2022 and we anticipate that this pressure will continue. We continue to differentiate Acthar Gel through pre-clinical studies and through product enhancements including the ongoing development of the Acthar Gel self-injection device, which is designed to create an easier and more patient-friendly application for single unit dosage indications.
Certain of our Specialty Brands products now do have direct competition in the U.S. market. For example, there is now direct competition in the U.S. market for INOmax. However, we believe INOmax's highly differentiated service offering and the next generation delivery system, if approved, will help to differentiate the product and mitigate the impact of competition longer-term.
The highly competitive environment of our Specialty Brands segment requires us to continually seek out new products to treat diseases and conditions in areas of high unmet medical need, to create technological innovations and to market our products effectively. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market, as well as other products that are subsequently developed by competitors. For our branded products, we may be granted market exclusivity either through the FDA, the U.S. Patent Office or similar agencies internationally. Regulatory exclusivity is granted by the FDA for new innovations, such as new clinical data, a new chemical entity or orphan drugs, and patents are issued for inventions, such as composition of matter or method of use. While patents offer a longer period of exclusivity, there are more bases to challenge patent-conferred exclusivity than with regulatory exclusivity. Generally, once market exclusivity expires on our branded products, competition will likely intensify as generic forms of the product are launched. Products that do not benefit from regulatory or patent exclusivity must rely on other competitive advantages, such as confidentiality agreements or product formulation trade secrets for difficult to replicate products.
Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in R&D than research-based pharmaceutical companies, allowing generic versions to typically be significantly less expensive than the related branded products. The generic form of a drug may also enjoy a preferred position relative to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or be routinely dispensed in substitution for the branded form by pharmacies. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions, decreased sales volume or both. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our branded products offer not only superior health outcomes but also cost advantages, as compared with other forms of care. Certain of our Specialty Brands products are targeted for niche patient populations with unmet medical needs, for example Acthar Gel, that may not be prescribed unless a clear benefit in efficacy or safety is demonstrated or until alternatives have failed to provide positive patient outcomes or are not well tolerated by the patient. 
As it relates to our Amitiza product, many patients are currently treated for chronic idiopathic constipation ("CIC"), irritable bowel syndrome with constipation ("IBS-C") or opioid-induced constipation ("OIC") with a variety of medications. Over-the-counter medications are available and are generally intended to provide relief for occasional constipation. Prescription products are also available and are generally intended to provide relief for chronic constipation. As such, the U.S. constipation market is expansive and diverse with a multitude of products intended to treat a large heterogeneous patient population. The prescription chronic constipation market can generally be bifurcated into two categories: 1) generic laxatives and 2) branded products. Generic laxatives make up roughly 80%-90% of the total prescription volume while branded prescriptions have grown to represent 10%-20% of the prescription market. At this time, Amitiza is the only branded product with chloride channel type-two activator mechanism of action. Amitiza is also the only branded product on the market today in three separate indications for CIC, IBS-C and OIC.
Prior to our acquisition of Amitiza in February 2018, the previous owner had entered into agreements to license certain rights to Amitiza to third parties in exchange for royalties on net sales of the product. Historically, we received a double-digit royalty based on a percentage of the gross profits of the licensed products sold during the term of the agreement, which was reduced to 
zero for the agreement with Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al. (collectively "Par") upon the entrance of two or more generics in addition to Par in fiscal 2023.
Specialty Generics. Our Specialty Generics products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets, primarily throughout the U.S. Our competitors vary depending upon therapeutic and product categories. Major competitors of our Specialty Generics products include Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., Amneal Pharmaceutical Ltd., Noramco, Inc. and Johnson Matthey plc, among others. We believe our secure sources of opioid raw materials, vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities, broad offerings of API controlled substances and acetaminophen, comprehensive generic controlled substances product line and established relationships with national and regional distributors of generic drugs in the U.S. enable us to compete with larger generic manufacturers. In addition, we believe that our experience with the FDA, DEA and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ("REMS") provides us the knowledge to operate efficiently and effectively in this highly regulated, competitive environment.
The Specialty Generics segment faces intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies marketing authorized generics, existing branded equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. The competition varies depending upon the specific product category and dosage strength. Among the large generic controlled substance providers, we are one of the only generic manufacturers that has its own controlled substance API manufacturing capability, and we believe that we offer more vertically integrated generic controlled substance products than any other U.S. manufacturer. New drugs and future developments in improved or advanced drug delivery technologies or other therapeutic techniques may provide therapeutic or cost advantages when compared to the products we sell. The maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and timely launch new generic products, as well as our ability to manufacture such new products in a cost efficient, high-quality manner and implement and drive market volume. 
As a result of consolidation among wholesale distributors and rapid growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors and retail drug store chains control a significant share of the market, and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. This has resulted in customers gaining more purchasing power. Consequently, there is heightened competition among generic drug producers for the business of this smaller and more selective customer base.
In our API business, we believe that our competitive advantages include our manufacturing capabilities in controlled substances that enable high-speed, high-volume tableting, packaging and distribution. Additionally, we believe we offer customers reliability of supply and broad-based technical customer service.
The competitive landscape in the acquisition and in-licensing of pharmaceutical products has intensified in recent years, reflecting both a reduction in the number of compounds available and an increase in the number of companies and the collective resources bidding on available assets. The ability to effectively compete in product development, acquisitions and in-licensing is important to our long-term growth strategy. In addition to product development and acquisitions, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product efficacy, safety, ease of use, price, demonstrated cost-effectiveness, third-party reimbursement, marketing effectiveness, customer service, reliability of supply, reputation and technical capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries covering certain products and have also developed brand names and trademarks for those and other products. Generally, our Specialty Brands business relies upon patent protection to protect our products, related inventions, and product innovations that are important to our business.
In a broad sense, patents provide the innovator companies with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to a product. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
In the U.S. branded pharmaceutical industry, an innovator product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: (i) patent rights held by the innovator company and listed in the FDA’s Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ("the Orange Book") and (ii) any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovator is entitled. In addition, commercial durability may also partially depend upon product-related trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and trademark and copyright laws. These additional items may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar technology or a bioequivalent product.
Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of pharmaceuticals. Regulatory exclusivity is independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory exclusivity on the basis of the competitor's own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
The patents and patent applications that relate to our major marketed products include:
•Acthar Gel. We have four U.S. patents that relate to Acthar Gel. These patents expire from 2031 to 2034. The Acthar Gel is protected primarily by trade secrets. In addition, we continue our efforts to pursue product enhancements, including the ongoing development of the Acthar Gel self-injection device, for which we have additional pending patent applications in the U.S. 
•INOmax. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for INOmax and related technologies. These include over 100 issued patents, expiring between 2023 to 2039, and numerous pending patent applications in the U.S., and over 700 issued patents, expiring between 2026 to 2037, and numerous pending patent applications in other countries.
•Therakos. We currently have 23 issued patents and two pending patent applications relating to Therakos in the U.S. These issued patents expire from 2023 to 2037. We also have 235 issued patents, expiring from 2023 to 2036, relating to Therakos in other countries. We have filed additional patent applications for this product. 
•StrataGraft. Our patent portfolio relating to StrataGraft includes 30 issued patents, expiring from 2022 to 2034, and numerous pending patent applications in the U.S. StrataGraft is protected by a mix of patents and trade secrets.
•Terlivaz. We currently have one issued patent, expiring in 2037, and a number of pending patent applications in the U.S. that relate to Terlivaz.
•Amitiza. We have four patents listed in the Orange Book that will expire from 2025 to 2027. We also obtained patent protection in Japan that will expire from 2023 to 2027. 
In addition, we have rights to a number of trademarks and service marks, and pending trademark and service mark applications, in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world to further protect the proprietary position of our products. 
We estimate the likely market exclusivity period for each of our branded products on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to predict with certainty the length of market exclusivity for any of our branded products because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity, the relative success or lack thereof by potential competitors' experience in product development and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.
We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks and license rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. For a discussion of the challenges we face in obtaining or maintaining patent and/or trade secret protection, see the risk factor captioned "We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, intellectual property rights may be limited or we may be subject to claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others" included within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report.
Regulatory Matters
Quality Assurance and Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements
The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drugs, biologics, and medical devices conform to current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP"). The cGMP regulations that the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, and are designed to ensure that the finished products meet all the required identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. The cGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulations, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FFDCA"). Other regulatory authorities have their own cGMP rules. Ensuring compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.
United States
In general, drug and device manufacturers operate in a highly regulated environment. In the U.S., we must comply with laws, regulations, guidance documents and standards promulgated by the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), the DEA, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Customs Service and state boards of pharmacy.
The FFDCA provides several distinct pathways for the approval of new drugs. A new drug application ("NDA") under Section 505(b)(1) of the FFDCA is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA generally contains results of the full set of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate. Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval; it permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference drug, and submit its own product-specific data - which may include data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant - to address differences between the product candidate and the reference drug. Drug manufacturers may also submit an ANDA under section 505(j) of the FFDCA to market a generic version of an approved branded drug product. The ANDA must show that the generic version is "therapeutically equivalent," or expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the branded drug product when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.
The FFDCA and Public Health Service Act ("PHSA") also provide pathways for the approvals of biological products. A company can submit a BLA to the FDA so that the agency can assess, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. The PHSA also permits an abbreviated approval pathway to encourage the development of biosimilars, which are defined as biologics that are "highly similar" to an already approved biologic ("reference product"), notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that have no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency.
The FDA typically uses different approval pathways for medical devices. To market and sell a new medical device in the U.S., the manufacturer generally must follow one of two paths. First, a manufacturer could follow what is known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process. This process requires the manufacturer to demonstrate that the medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second process, pre-market approval, is a more stringent time-consuming process. This requires that the medical device is independently proven to be safe and effective for its intended use.
For all pharmaceuticals (including both drugs and biologics) sold in the U.S., the FDA and other federal regulatory agencies also closely regulate the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A pharmaceutical product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for "off-label" uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling—because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. In general, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") or the Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") of the HHS, as well as state authorities. Enforcement action could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal penalties and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
In addition, the manufacture, marketing and selling of certain drug products that are controlled substances may be limited by quota grants and other requirements or restrictions enforced by the DEA. Refer to "Drug Enforcement Administration" within this Item 1. Business for further information.
The path leading to FDA approval of a marketing application (NDA for a drug, BLA for a biological product) for a new pharmaceutical product begins when the product is merely a chemical formulation in the laboratory. In general, the process involves the following steps:
•Completion of formulation and laboratory testing in accordance with good laboratory practice that fully characterizes the drug product from a pre-clinical perspective and provides preliminary evidence that the drug product is safe to test in human beings;
•Filing an investigational new drug ("IND") application with the FDA, which must become effective before the conduct of clinical trials (testing in human beings under adequate and well-controlled conditions);
•Approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•Designing and conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to show the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the proposed indication in accordance with the applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes collectively referred to as good clinical practice ("GCP");
•Submitting the marketing application for FDA review, which provides a complete characterization of the product;
•Determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a marketing application to accept and file the application for review;
•Satisfactory completion of potential FDA pre-approval inspections of the designated facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements;
•Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the marketing application;
•Payment of applicable user fees;
•If applicable, satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in which the FDA requests views from outside experts in evaluating the application;
•FDA approval of the application, including prescribing information, labeling and packaging of the drug product; and
•Implementation of a REMS program, if applicable, and conduct of any required Phase 4 studies, and compliance with post-approval requirements, including ongoing monitoring and reporting of adverse events related to the product.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, although they may overlap. The four phases are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational product candidate into humans. Phase 1 trials generally are conducted in healthy volunteers but in some cases are conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 trials, sufficient information about the investigational product candidate’s pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted in patients with the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate, and to obtain initial evidence of the effectiveness of the investigational product candidate for a particular indication. Phase 2 trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited subject population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
•Phase 3. Phase 3 trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Phase 3 trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the drug; however, the FDA may find a single Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence to be sufficient in rare instances, particularly in an area of significant unmet medical need and if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit.
•Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period of time, if at all. The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by a health authority (such as the FDA), an IRB/ethics committee, or by a company for various reasons. At any time, the FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial, which is referred to as a clinical hold, or impose other sanctions, if the agency believes the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain clinical trial results and other trial information after completion.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a marketing application to request market approval for the product in specified indications.
New Drug Applications and Biologics License Applications. In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application (NDA for drug product candidates and BLA for biological product candidates) must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), the FDA has the authority to collect fees from drug manufacturers who submit pharmaceutical marketing applications for review and approval, although there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. These user fees help the FDA fund the drug approval process. For calendar 2023, the user fee rate has been set at $3,242,030 for a marketing application requiring clinical data (which could be a 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) NDA), and $1,621,010 for an application not requiring a clinical data. No user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan-designated indication. We expense these fees as they are incurred. 
The FDA will initially review the pharmaceutical marketing application (NDA or BLA) for completeness before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the application submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of applications. Applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of FDA’s acceptance for filing. An accelerated six-month review can be given to applications that meet certain criteria. The FDA can extend the review period by three months, or potentially longer, to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information provided in the initial submission. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. FDA Advisory Committee meetings are often held for New Chemical Entities, novel indications, or for applications that otherwise present scientific, technical, or policy questions on which the agency believes it would benefit from the perspectives of outside experts. An advisory committee meeting includes a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an application, the FDA often will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured for cGMP compliance, and may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. After it evaluates the application and the results of inspections, the FDA issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If those deficiencies are addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use ("ETASU"). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and prior FDA approval of a supplemental application (or in some cases a new application) before the change can be implemented. A supplemental application for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original marketing applications.
Expedited Programs. The FDA maintains certain expedited programs to facilitate the development and review processes for certain qualifying pharmaceutical product candidates, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and regenerative medicine advanced therapy ("RMAT") designation. A pharmaceutical product 
candidate may be granted fast track designation if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. With fast track designation, the sponsor may be eligible for more frequent opportunities to obtain the FDA’s feedback, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of an application before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. Even if a product receives fast track designation, the designation can be rescinded and provides no assurance that a product will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously than would otherwise have been the case, or that the product will be approved at all.
The FDA may designate a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if it finds that the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other product candidates or approved products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies, more frequent interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review. Even if a product receives Breakthrough Therapy designation, the designation can be rescinded and provides no assurance that a product will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously than would otherwise have been the case, or that the product will be approved at all.
Accelerated approval under FDA regulations allows a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies to be approved on the basis of either an intermediate clinical endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for confirmatory clinical trials to be conducted with due diligence to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm clinical benefit and for all promotional materials to be submitted to the FDA for review prior to dissemination.
The FDA may also grant priority review designation to a product candidate, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from FDA filing, or eight months from the sponsor’s submission. Priority review may be granted where a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to available therapy. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from FDA filing or 12 months from sponsor submission. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
RMAT designation may be granted to regenerative medicine therapies, defined as cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the regenerative medicine therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with FDA. The FDA granted StrataGraft RMAT designation in July 2017. 
Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a "rare disease or condition," which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If orphan product designation is sought, it must be requested before submitting an NDA for the drug for the proposed rare disease or condition. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not, by itself, convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which the FDA has interpreted to preclude approving for seven years any other sponsor’s application to market the same drug for the same use for which the drug has been granted orphan drug designation, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protection against generic competition, including patents that we hold for our products. A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation may also be granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application.
Generally, orphan drug exclusivity does not block approval of competing products intended for the orphan-protected indication but containing a different active moiety, or containing the same moiety but intended for a different use. Orphan product exclusivity that could block a competitor to one of our products also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of a product containing the same moiety for the same orphan disease or condition. 
Marketing Exclusivity. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, which is a drug substance that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot accept for review any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for which a new chemical entity is a reference product (an application that contains a challenge to a patent associated with the reference product may be submitted at four years after reference 
product approval). There are provisions that operate to preclude approval of the application for an additional period of time. Certain changes to a drug, such as the approval of a new indication, may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a drug that includes the change. 
Under the PHSA, the FDA must wait four years after approval of a biological product under a BLA before accepting a filing for a biosimilar version of the reference product, and the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar version of the reference product until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. The PHSA also provides for limited regulatory exclusivity for the first FDA-approved interchangeable biologic with respect to each reference product. This means that the FDA will defer approval of additional interchangeable biologics to the same reference product for defined periods of one year or more.
Patent Term Restoration. A portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an application is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the application, plus the time between the date of submission of the application and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.
Post-Approval Regulation. After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, a sponsor is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an application, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a sponsor is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information, submit annual reports and comply with advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturing must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, as discussed in Quality Assurance and Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements above.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings, contraindications, or limitations of use, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
ANDA Process. The path leading to FDA approval of generic drug product under an ANDA is different from that of an NDA, a BLA or even a biosimilar. Generally, a generic drug product is one that is the same as an approved "brand" or "innovator" drug product (the reference listed drug or "RLD") in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, and route of administration, bioequivalent to the RLD, and labeled the same as the RLD, Generic drug applications are termed "abbreviated" because they are not required to include data to establish safety and effectiveness, instead relying on demonstrating the sameness to the RLD, which FDA has already found to be safe and effective.
 The FDA has the authority to collect, user fees from generic drug manufacturers who submit ANDAs for review and approval, and the fees collected help the FDA fund the drug approval process. The fiscal 2023 user fee rate is set at $240,580 for an ANDA. These fees are expensed as incurred. The FDA has set a target of approving 90% of standard ANDA submissions within ten months of submission for submissions made in 2023, and 90% of priority ANDA submissions within eight months of submission.
Medical Devices. There are two primary pathways to receive authorization to distribute a new device in the U.S. The first pathway is premarket notification or the 510(k) process. Under this pathway, the applicant must demonstrate to the FDA that the new device is as safe and effective or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. The applicant can demonstrate this by submitting data. This data may be from human clinical trials. The FDA will make a determination as to whether the new device is substantially equivalent before commercial distribution occurs. Changes that do not significantly affect the safety or efficacy of a legally marketed device may generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications.
The second primary pathway is a premarket approval application ("PMA"). This pathway is generally more complex, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process. Under the PMA pathway, the applicant must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This generally requires data from clinical trials to show the safety and efficacy of the device. These trials must be performed in accordance with the applicable Investigational Device Exemption regulations. The FDA will approve the application if it finds that the evidence is scientifically valid to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use.
Patent and Non-Patent Exclusivity Periods. A sponsor of an NDA is required to identify in its application any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application. Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists these patents in the Orange Book. Any person that files a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the type of NDA that relies upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed, or an ANDA to secure approval of a generic version of a previous drug, must make a certification in respect to listed patents. The FDA may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the NDA for 
the RLD of the bases upon which the patents are challenged, and the holder of the RLD does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of notice. If an infringement suit is filed, the FDA may not approve the later application until the earliest of: (a) 30 months after receipt of the notice by the holder of the NDA for the RLD; (b) entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; (c) such time as the court may order; or (d) the expiration of the patent.
One of the key motivators for challenging patents is the 180-day market exclusivity period ("generic exclusivity") granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to file an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification and that prevails in litigation with the manufacturer of the branded product over the applicable patent(s) or is not sued or enters into a settlement agreement with the manufacturer of the branded product. For a variety of reasons, there are situations in which a company may not be able to take advantage of an award of generic exclusivity. The determination of when generic exclusivity begins and ends is very complicated as it depends on several different factors.
The holder of the NDA for the RLD may also be entitled to certain non-patent exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or 505(b)(2) NDA product. Generally, if the RLD is a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept for filing any application that references the innovator's NDA for five years from the approval of the innovator's NDA. However, this five-year period is shortened to four years where a filer's ANDA includes a Paragraph IV certification. In other cases, where the innovator has provided certain clinical study information, the FDA may accept for filing, but may not approve, an application that references the innovator's NDA for a period of three years from the approval of the innovator's NDA.
Certain additional periods of exclusivity may be available if the RLD is indicated for use in a rare disease or condition or is studied for pediatric indications.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies. The FDA has the authority to require a pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide a REMS that is intended to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product or class of products outweigh the risks of harm. The goal of these programs is to mitigate the risk of abuse, misuse, overdose and accidental exposure as well as educating prescribers, pharmacists, healthcare providers and patients about the safe use of the drug product or class of drug products and the treatment and monitoring of patients. The FDA has the authority to impose civil penalties on or take other enforcement action against any drug manufacturer who fails to properly implement an approved REMS program. We participate in the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl REMS Program, Opioid Analgesic REMS, Buprenorphine Transmucosal Products for Opioid Dependence REMS, Vigabatrin REMS and other such REMS programs.
Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA is the U.S. federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 ("CSA"). Compounds that have a potential for dependence and abuse are scheduled as controlled substances under the CSA and similar state and foreign laws. Drugs that are scheduled as controlled substances are subject to stringent regulatory requirements, including requirements for registering manufacturing and distribution facilities, security controls and employee screening, recordkeeping, reporting, product labeling and packaging, import and export. There are five federal schedules for controlled substances, known as Schedule I, II, III, IV and V. The CSA classifies drugs and other substances based on identified potential for abuse. The regulatory requirements that apply to a drug vary depending on the particular controlled substance schedule into which a drug is placed, based on consideration of a number of factors, including its potential for dependence and abuse. Schedules I and II contain the most stringent restrictions and requirements, and Schedule V the least. Schedule I controlled substances, such as heroin and LSD, have a high abuse potential and have no currently accepted medical use; thus, they cannot be lawfully marketed or sold. Opioids, such as oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are Schedule II controlled substances. Consequently, the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of these substances are highly regulated. For all controlled substances, there are potential criminal and civil penalties that apply for the failure to meet applicable legal requirements, and healthcare professionals must have a DEA license in order to handle, prescribe, or dispense controlled substances.
The DEA regulates the availability of substances that are classified as Schedule I or II controlled substances by setting annual quotas. Every year, we must apply to the DEA for manufacturing quota to manufacture API and procurement quota to manufacture finished dosage products for our products that are classified as Schedule II controlled substances. Given that the DEA has discretion to grant or deny our manufacturing and procurement quota requests, the quota the DEA grants may be insufficient to meet our commercial and R&D needs. In calendar year 2022, manufacturing and procurement quotas granted by the DEA were sufficient to meet our sales and inventory requirements. In December 2022, the DEA continued to further reduce, as it has done over the past several years, the manufacturing quota for the top misused Schedule II opioids that may be manufactured in the U.S. in calendar year 2023. This includes oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone and fentanyl. The DEA has complete discretion to adjust or leave unchanged these quotas from time to time during the calendar year and to allocate manufacturing and procurement quota to manufacturers.
DEA regulations include certain restrictions for a manufacturer in the U.S. to import finished dosage forms of controlled substances manufactured outside the U.S. These rules reflect a broader enforcement approach by the DEA to regulate the manufacture, distribution and dispensing of legally produced controlled substances. Accordingly, drug manufacturers who market and sell finished dosage forms of controlled substances in the U.S. typically manufacture or have them manufactured in the U.S.
The DEA also requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior 
to distribution of the controlled substance order. A compliant suspicious order monitoring ("SOM") system includes well-defined due diligence, "know your customer" efforts and order monitoring. One of our Specialty Generics subsidiaries utilizes all available transaction information to identify suspicious orders of any Mallinckrodt controlled substance product and reports such suspicious orders to the DEA when it concludes that chargeback data or other information indicates that a downstream registrant poses a risk of diversion.
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The facilities must have the security, control and accounting mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent loss and diversion.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party API suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.
We and, to our knowledge, our third-party API suppliers, dosage form manufacturers, distributors and researchers have all necessary registrations, and we believe all registrants operate in conformity with applicable registration requirements, under controlled substance laws.
Government Benefit Programs. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, Tricare and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels, as well as require that each pharmaceutical manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program pay rebates to individual states based on a percentage of their net sales arising from Medicaid program-reimbursed products. The federal and state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for, or increasing rebates on, prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures, which could have material adverse consequences for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole and, consequently, also for us. However, we believe we have provided for our best estimate of potential refunds based on current information available.
From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 created a prescription drug coverage program for people with Medicare through a system of government-regulated private market drug benefit plans. This law provides a prescription drug benefit to seniors and individuals with disabilities in the Medicare program ("Medicare Part D"). Congress continues to examine various Medicare policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the Medicare program.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, may implement or revise reimbursement or coverage restrictions under those programs, and a state may do likewise under the Medicaid program. Any reduction in reimbursement or restriction of coverage under Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments or restriction of coverage by private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended ("Affordable Care Act") provided for major changes to the U.S. healthcare system, which impacted the delivery and payment for healthcare services in the U.S. Our business has been impacted by, among other things, changes to the rebates under the Medicaid Fee-For-Service Program and new rebates on Medicaid Managed Care utilization and the imposition of an annual fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers. Medicaid provisions reduced net sales by $70.7 million, $65.2 million, $106.5 million and $665.3 million for the period June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 (Successor), the period January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 (Predecessor), fiscal 2021 (Predecessor) and fiscal 2020 (Predecessor), respectively. The fiscal 2021 (Predecessor) decrease in provision for Medicaid payments was due to the $536.0 million retrospective one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit in fiscal 2020 (Predecessor). Our business was also impacted by the annual fee on branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers, which is reflected within selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A"). During the period June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 (Successor), the period January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 (Predecessor), and fiscal 2020 (Predecessor), we recorded an expense of $2.0 million, $3.8 million and $11.6 million, respectively. Comparatively, in fiscal 2021 (Predecessor), we recorded a gain of $1.0 million driven primarily by favorable adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for prior periods primarily related to the Medicaid lawsuit ruling.
The Affordable Care Act also established a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, under which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during the coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. These discounts were increased to 70% of negotiated costs pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which as effective beginning in 2019.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("Inflation Reduction Act") which, among other things, establishes Medicare Part B and Part D inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the average sales price of a Part B drug or the average manufacture price of a Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay an inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The Inflation Reduction Act also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologics 
without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price, starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. The Inflation Reduction Act further makes changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including sunsetting the existing coverage gap discount program and replacing it with a new manufacturer discount program in 2025. Failure to offer discounts under this program could be subject to civil monetary penalties. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, certain drug products may be eligible for a small biotech exemption based on specified thresholds around Medicare program spending. Products with this designation are exempt from the drug price negotiation program in 2026, 2027, and 2028; and will be phased into the manufacturer liability for Medicare Part D benefit redesign over a number of years. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the government health benefit programs. The Inflation Reduction Act or other legislative changes could impact the market conditions for our product candidates. 
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement. Certain of our affiliates that are manufacturers participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs. Each manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for its covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program, as a condition of having federal funds available for that manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data the manufacturer reports on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which best price, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. Where the average manufacturer price of a drug increases faster than the pace of inflation, the drug may be subject to an additional rebate paid by its manufacturer in the amount that the average manufacturer price has exceeded the pace of inflation. Currently, the Medicaid rebate is capped at 100 percent of the average manufacturer price, but, effective January 1, 2024, this cap on the rebate will be removed, the rebate liability could increase significantly for certain products. On December 31, 2020, CMS issued a final regulation that modified prior Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value‑based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); and provide definitions for "line extension," "new formulation," and related terms, with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions that are subject to an alternative rebate formula (beginning in 2022). A manufacturer’s failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment requirements, as well as forthcoming statutory changes to such requirements, could negatively impact its financial results.
Federal law requires that each manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration ("HRSA"), requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B "ceiling price" for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients, certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals. The Affordable Care Act exempts "orphan drugs" from the ceiling price requirements for certain hospital covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and, in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Where a drug is subject to an additional rebate, as noted previously, or a low best price, the 340B ceiling price may calculate as low as, but not lower than, $0.01 per unit. Changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate amount also could affect a manufacturer’s 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact results of operations.
HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that are found to have knowingly and intentionally overcharged covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is unclear how the government will apply its enforcement authority under the regulation. Manufacturers also are required to report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA then publishes them to covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution ("ADR"), process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and result in additional liability.
For calendar quarters beginning January 1, 2022, manufacturers are required to report the average sales price for certain Medicare Part B-covered products under the Medicare program, whereas they previously were only required to do so if they participated in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Starting in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to Medicare for single source drugs or biologics, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under Medicare Part B and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages, for units of discarded drug reimbursed by Medicare Part B in excess of ten percent of total allowed charges under Medicare Part B for that drug. 
Manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125 percent of the refund amount. In addition, as noted previously, a manufacturer may be liable for Part B inflation rebates for utilization in quarters starting with the first quarter of 2023. Manufacturers may be liable for civil monetary penalties for violations of this program.
Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for approved products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact results of operations. Also, the Medicare Part B drug payment methodology is subject to change based on legislation enacted by Congress. 
Congress also could enact additional changes that affect overall rebate liability and the information manufacturers report to the government as part of price reporting calculations, which could impact the market conditions for our products. We further expect continued scrutiny on government price reporting and pricing more generally from Congress, agencies, and other bodies, and are seeing an increase in state interest in price reporting, transparency, and other policies to address drug pricing concerns. For additional information about the risk associated with these programs, please see "Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, are complex. Any determination of failure to comply with these obligations or those relating to healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have a material adverse effect on our business" included within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"), Department of Defense ("DoD"), Public Health Service, and Coast Guard (collectively, the Big Four agencies) and certain federal grantees, we are required to participate in the VA Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") pricing program, established under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we are obligated to make our "covered" drugs (i.e., innovator drugs and biologics) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to the Big Four agencies that is no higher than the Federal Ceiling Price ("FCP"), which is a price calculated pursuant to a statutory formula. The FSS program also allows us (but does not require us) to list certain non-covered drugs on an FSS contract at negotiated pricing, not capped at the FCP. The FCP is derived from a calculated price point called the "non-federal average manufacturer price" ("non-FAMP"), which we are required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS contract also contains extensive disclosure and certification requirements. In addition, Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, requires us to pay quarterly rebates to DoD on utilization of covered drugs that are dispensed through DoD’s Tricare network pharmacies to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual non-FAMP and FCP for the calendar year that the product was dispensed. If we overcharge the government in connection with the FSS contract or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Rebate Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act ("FCA") and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and any response to government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, and other related laws that apply to healthcare products and services that are ultimately paid for by government health care programs. These laws include the following:
•The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value to induce (or in return for) the referral of business, including the purchase, recommendation or prescription of a particular drug reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution and administrative sanction, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the DOJ and OIG. Practices or arrangements that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without providing specific intent to violate the statute.
•The federal civil FCA prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement material to a false claim. A claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of themselves and federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery.
•The healthcare fraud provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), which extend to non-government health benefit programs and which impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third party payors, or falsifying or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, fines (including mandatory penalties on a per claim or statement basis for violations of the FCA), damages, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products and are applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. In addition, some states in the U.S. have enacted compliance and reporting requirements aimed at drug manufacturers. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and the FCA and which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Other states restrict whether and when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to health care professionals or engage in other marketing-related activities, and certain states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives.
We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom ("U.K.") Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
Sunshine Act and Transparency Laws
The U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act ("Sunshine Act") requires tracking of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests held by physicians and their families, and reporting to the federal government and public disclosure of these data. As of last year, manufacturers must also report transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Certain states also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report transfers of value made to healthcare providers in the applicable state. 
Data Protection and Privacy
We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of health related and other personal data we collect and maintain (e.g., European Union’s ("E.U.") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ("FTC Act"), HIPAA, and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). 
In Europe, the GDPR governs the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Among other things, the GDPR imposes requirements regarding the security of personal data and notification of data breaches to the competent national data processing authorities, requires having lawful bases on which personal data can be processed. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of our annual global turnover) and confers the right for data subjects to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. 
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") sets expectations for failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure, or failing to provide a level of security commensurate to promises made to individual about the security of their personal information (such as in a privacy notice) may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. With respect to privacy, the FTC also sets expectations that companies honor the privacy promises made to individuals about how the company handles consumers’ personal information; any failure to honor promises, such as the statements made in a privacy policy or on a website, may also constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. While we do not intend to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the FTC has the power to enforce promises as it interprets them, and events that we cannot fully control, such as data breaches, may be result in FTC enforcement. Enforcement by the FTC under the FTC Act can result in civil penalties or enforcement actions. 
HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their "business associates" – certain persons or covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service or performing a function on behalf of a covered entity. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
In California, the CCPA establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency and creates new data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA and its implementing regulations have already been amended multiple times since their enactment, including by the CPRA. The CPRA introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency ("CPPA"). The amendments introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and damages. Other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have enacted similar privacy laws that impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business and we continue to assess the impact of these state legislation, on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may impose limitations on our activities or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
Compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or our business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, or withdrawal of non-compliant products from a market.
Compliance Programs
In order to systematically and comprehensively mitigate the risks of non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements described within this Item 1. Business, we have developed what we believe to be robust compliance programs based on the April 2003 OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, the U.S. DOJ Guidance on the Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs, the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, the Code of Ethics of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, the U.K. Anti-Bribery guidance, and other relevant guidance from government and national or regional industry codes of behavior. As further described below, we also operate under a corporate integrity agreement ("CIA") and an Operating Injunction (as defined below). We conduct ongoing compliance training programs for all employees and maintain a 24-hour integrity and compliance reporting hotline with a strict policy of non-retaliation. Our compliance programs are implemented and facilitated by our Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"), who reports to the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Governance and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. The Compliance function is independent of the manufacturing and commercial operations functions.
As part of our compliance program, we have implemented internal cross-functional processes to review and approve product-specific promotional materials, presentations and external communications to address the risk of misbranding, mislabeling or making false or misleading claims about our products through our promotional efforts. In addition, we monitor business activities through our compliance monitoring program including: sales representative expenses, promotional speaker activities and a "ride along" program for compliance to observe field sales and medical representatives interacting with healthcare professionals and organizations. We have also implemented a comprehensive controlled substances compliance program, including SOM and anti-diversion efforts and we regularly assist federal, state and local law enforcement and prosecutors in the U.S. by providing information and testimony on our products and placebos for use by the DEA and other law enforcement agencies in investigations and at trial. As part of this program, we also work with some of our customers to help develop and implement what we believe are best practices for SOM and other anti-diversion activities.
We believe our compliance program's design addresses our FDA, healthcare anti-kickback, anti-fraud, and anti-bribery-related risks. We believe we have complied with reporting obligations of the Sunshine Act and relevant state disclosure laws and have implemented a program across the Company to track and report data per CMS guidance and state disclosure requirements.
Corporate Integrity Agreement
In concert with the Plan, the Company entered into a CIA with the OIG within the HHS in March 2022. The CIA has a five-year term and requires, among other things, enhancements to our compliance program, fulfillment of self-reporting, monitoring and training obligations, management certifications and resolutions from the Mallinckrodt Board of Directors. In addition, we are required to retain an independent review organization to conduct annual reviews of certain Company systems and transactions related to Specialty Brands government pricing and patient assistance activities. We continue to comply with our CIA obligations.
Operating Injunction
In connection with the Plan, we agreed to be bound by an injunction enjoining those entities from engaging in certain conduct related to the manner in which they operate their opioid business ("Operating Injunction"). The Operating Injunction prohibits, among other things, certain promotional activities related to opioid products and pain treatment, financial and in-kind support for third parties involved with opioids or pain treatment, and certain lobbying activities and communications related to opioids and pain treatment. The Operating Injunction also contains requirements for controlled substances SOM and reporting. The Operating Injunction further requires Mallinckrodt to make available certain clinical data through a third-party data archive and publicly disclose certain produced documents related to the opioid litigation. We implemented an Opioid Product Operating Injunction compliance program as a result of the Operating Injunction. The Operating Injunction provides that Mallinckrodt must retain an independent monitor to evaluate and audit compliance with the Operating Injunction for a term of five to seven years. On February 8, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order appointing R. Gil Kerlikowske to serve as monitor.
The monitor has issued seven compliance reports describing his work and making certain recommendations regarding potential enhancements to the Company's processes that the Company has worked to implement. The Company has, among other actions, retained a consulting firm with expertise in data analytics to consult regarding the Company's SOM program; enhanced the Company's internal system for customer inquiries and concerns to encourage further collaboration across business units; and implemented a plan to audit state and federal lobbying activity to monitor compliance with the Operating Injunction.
Outside the United States
Outside the U.S., we must comply with laws, guidelines and standards promulgated by other regulatory authorities that regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and selling of medicinal products and medical devices, including, but not limited to, Health Canada, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") in the U.K., the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), the European Commission and member states of the E.U. and their competent authorities such as the Irish Medicines Board, the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Japan, the European Pharmacopoeia of the Council of Europe and the International Conference on Harmonization. Although international harmonization efforts continue, many laws, guidelines and standards differ by region or country. We currently market our products in Canada, in various countries in the E.U., and in the Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and Asia-Pacific regions. The approval requirements and process vary by country, and the time required to obtain a marketing authorization may vary from that required for FDA approval. Certain drug products and variations in drug product lines also must meet country-specific and other local regulatory requirements. The following discussion highlights some of the differences in the approval process in other regions or countries outside the U.S.
European Union. Marketing authorizations for medicinal products are obtained pursuant to a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. Irrespective of the procedure, an authorization may only be granted to an applicant established in the E.U. 
The centralized procedure, which provides for a single marketing authorization valid for all E.U. member states as well as three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), is mandatory for the approval of certain medicinal products including orphan medicinal products and biotechnology-derived medicinal products and is optional for others such as novel drug products that are in the interest of patient health. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted for review to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use established at the EMA, which makes a recommendation on the application to the European Commission, who determines whether or not to approve the application. The decentralized procedure allows companies to file identical applications to several E.U. member states simultaneously for product candidates that have not yet been authorized in any E.U. member state. The maximum timeframe for completion of the procedure is in principle 210 days.
A mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a product already authorized in one E.U. member state to apply for that authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other E.U. member states.. 
Biosimilars can only be authorized once the period of data exclusivity on our candidate, as 'reference' biological medicinal product, has expired. In general, this means that the biological reference medicine must have been authorized for at least eight years before another company can apply for approval of a similar biological product and further two years until the biosimilar can be marketed.
Medical Devices. In the E.U., medical devices must currently comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements laid down in Annex I to the E.U. Medical Devices Regulation ("MDR"). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark on products, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the E.U. To demonstrate compliance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the E.U. MDR and obtain the right to affix the CE mark, medical devices manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Apart from low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile and not reusable), in relation to which the manufacturer may issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the General Safety and Performance Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body, which is an organization designated by a Competent Authority of an E.U. member state to conduct conformity 
assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the notified body would audit and examine the technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices. The notified body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements. This Certificate and the related conformity assessment process entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. Notified bodies must be accredited by the E.U. member states’ accreditation bodies to conduct assessment procedures for medical devices in accordance with the E.U. MDR. There are currently a relatively small number of notified bodies that have been accredited to conduct these assessments. This may delay conformity assessment procedures in the future in the E.U.
The E.U. has also adopted directives and other laws that govern the labeling, marketing, advertising, supply, distribution of medicinal products and medical devices. Such directives set regulatory standards throughout the E.U. and permit member states to supplement such standards with additional requirements. 
Country-specific regulation of the E.U. member states remains essential also regarding pricing and reimbursement. European governments also regulate medicinal products prices through the control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of such costs to patients. Many regulate the pricing of a new medicinal product at launch through direct price controls or reference pricing and, recently, some have also imposed additional cost-containment measures on drug products. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between E.U. member states. Many European governments also advocate generic substitution by requiring or permitting prescribers or pharmacists to substitute a different company's generic version of a branded medicinal product that was prescribed, and patients are unlikely to take a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government.
The regulatory regime for the U.K. is different which may cause additional administrative burdens. The U.K., comprising Great Britain and Northern Ireland, left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, following which existing E.U. medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the U.K. during the transition period until December 31, 2020 under the terms of the E.U.-U.K. Withdrawal Agreement. During this period, the U.K. and the E.U. negotiated a Trade and Cooperation Agreement ("TCA"), for their future relationship that became effective on January 1, 2021.
Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) is now treated as a "third country," a country that is not a member of the E.U. whereas, as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland continues to follow the E.U. regulatory regime. The MHRA is responsible for both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Following the effectiveness of the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on January 31, 2020, the U.K. regulatory regime for clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance largely mirrors that of the E.U. As part of the TCA, the E.U. and the U.K. will recognize Good manufacturing practice ("GMP") inspections carried out by the other party and accept official GMP documents issued by the other party. The TCA also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The U.K. has unilaterally agreed to accept E.U. batch testing and batch release for a period of at least 2 years which terminated on January 1, 2023. However, the E.U. continues to apply E.U. laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the E.U. territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the U.K. must be retested and re-released when entering the E.U. market for commercial use. As it relates to marketing authorizations, Great Britain has introduced a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland, however, continues to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission. The U.K. regulatory regime for medical devices is largely aligned with previous E.U. directives and will soon be subject to changes that will probably bring it closer to the current E.U. regulations.
Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets continue to evolve their regulatory review and oversight processes. At present, such countries typically require prior regulatory approval or marketing authorization from large, developed markets (such as the U.S.) before they will initiate or complete their review. Some countries also require the applicant to conduct local clinical trials as a condition of marketing authorization. Many emerging markets continue to implement measures to control drug product prices, such as implementing direct price controls or advocating the prescribing and use of generic drugs.
Environmental
Our operations, like those of other pharmaceutical companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing processes and, as such, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations. We cannot provide assurance that we have been or will be in full compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at all times. Certain environmental laws assess strict, (i.e., can be imposed regardless of fault) joint and several liability on current or previous owners of real property and current or previous owners or operators of facilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances. We have, from time to time, received notification from the EPA and from state environmental agencies in the U.S. that conditions at a number of sites where the disposal of hazardous substances has taken place requires investigation, cleanup and other possible remedial actions. These agencies may require that we reimburse the 
government for costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the cost of investigation and cleanup of these sites including compensation for damage to natural resources. Primarily due to past operations, operations of predecessor companies or past disposal practices, we have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities as well as former disposal sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations, as further described in Note 19 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. 
We continue to be dedicated to environmental sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. Environmental laws are complex and generally have become more stringent over time. We believe that our operations currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and to address liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances.
Raw Materials
We contract with various third-party manufacturers and suppliers, most notably related to our Specialty Brands products, to provide us with raw materials used in our products, finished goods and certain services. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials, finished goods, services or components required for our products, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The active ingredients in the majority of our current Specialty Generics products and certain products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation and the DEA limits the availability of narcotic raw materials and the production of APIs and generic Schedule II substances through manufacturing and procurement quotas that we must apply for annually in order to obtain and produce these substances.
Sales, Marketing and Customers
Sales and Marketing
We market our branded products to physicians (including neurologists, rheumatologists, hepatologists, nephrologists, pulmonologists, ophthalmologists, oncologists, neonatologists and surgeons), other health care providers including respiratory therapists, pharmacists, pharmacy buyers, hospital procurement departments, ambulatory surgical centers and specialty pharmacies. We distribute our branded and generic products through independent channels, including wholesale drug distributors, specialty pharmaceutical distributors, retail pharmacy chains, hospital networks, ambulatory surgical centers and governmental agencies. In addition, we contract with group purchasing organizations ("GPO(s)") and managed care organizations to improve access to our products. We sell and distribute API directly or through distributors to other pharmaceutical companies.
For further information on our sales and marketing strategies, refer to "Our Businesses and Product Strategies" above.
Customers
Net sales to distributors that accounted for more than 10.0% of our total net sales in the period from June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 (Successor), the period from January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 (Predecessor), fiscal 2021 (Predecessor) and fiscal 2020 (Predecessor) were as follows:

 | Successor | | Predecessor 
 | Period from June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 | | Period from January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 | | Year Ended December 31, 2021 | | Year Ended December 25, 2020
FFF Enterprise, Inc. | 26.1 | % | | 11.8 | % | | *% | *% 
CuraScript, Inc. | * | | 15.6 | % | | 26.1 | % | 27.4 | %

* Net sales to this distributor were less than 10.0% of total net sales during the respective periods presented above.
No other customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in the above periods presented. 
Manufacturing and Distribution
As of December 30, 2022 (Successor), we had 11 manufacturing sites, including eight located in the U.S., as well as sites in Ireland and Japan, which handle production, assembly, quality assurance testing, packaging and sterilization of our products. 
Approximately 93.9%, 4.0% and 2.1% of our manufacturing production (as measured by cost of production) was performed within the U.S., Ireland and Japan, respectively, in fiscal 2022.
As of December 30, 2022 (Successor), we maintained distribution centers in ten countries. In addition, in certain countries outside the U.S. we utilize third-party distribution centers. Products generally are delivered to these distribution centers from our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products by road, rail, sea and air.
We utilize contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to manufacture certain of our finished goods that are available for resale. We most frequently utilize CMOs in the manufacture of certain of our Specialty Brands products, including Acthar Gel (for finish and filling of the product) and Therakos products. 
Seasonality
We have historically experienced fluctuations in our business resulting from seasonality. For example, Acthar Gel has typically experienced lower net sales during the first calendar quarter compared to other calendar quarters, which we believe is partially attributable to effects of annual insurance deductibles and the lack of warm temperatures that may exacerbate certain medical conditions. DEA quotas for raw materials and final dosage products are allocated in each calendar year to companies and may impact our sales until the DEA grants additional quotas, if any. Impacts from quota limitations are most commonly experienced during the third and fourth calendar quarters, and we have typically experienced lower net sales in DEA controlled products during the fourth calendar quarter. While we have experienced these fluctuations in the past, they may not be indicative of what we will experience in the future.
Human Capital
At Mallinckrodt, we value our employees as our most important asset. We aim to create a culture and a work environment that is inclusive and that welcomes diverse experiences and perspectives. We work hard to identify, retain and attract a diverse workforce that shares our corporate vision to improve the lives of underserved patients with severe and critical conditions. We believe that in doing this, it will make us stronger and more innovative. We invest in human resources programs designed to develop capabilities to deliver on our critical business priorities. We do this by offering competitive pay and benefit programs, investing in our employees' growth and development and creating a safe and healthy work environment. We embrace diversity and empower each individual employee to bring their whole, authentic self to work. Further, we encourage and support our employees to be active members of their communities.
As of December 30, 2022 (Successor), we employed a multi-national workforce of approximately 2,700 people. Our products are developed by a workforce with specialized degrees in science, engineering and technology. Our manufacturing and distribution sites located across the U.S., Ireland and Japan made up 60% of our workforce and 18% were field-based working across multiple countries engaging with healthcare professionals and facilities.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We strive to foster inclusive and equitable work environment and a diverse workforce that reflects the customers and patients we serve. We believe the unique and diverse perspectives of our employees enable us to better understand and respond to patients' needs.
Our workforce is built on the foundation of equal opportunity and fair treatment. As a multi-national company, we celebrate the diversity of our workforce. Our employee-led Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") Council and BRGs play key roles in cultivating and inspiring a more inclusive culture. These groups are open to anyone and are typically centered on shared interests, identities and affiliations. Our BRGs provide resources for professional development, personal growth, community engagement, well-being and networking, all while fostering connectivity and enhancing our unique culture.
Our BRGs frequently host company-wide educational events to help foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. Examples from 2022 include:

Social Impact
Mallinckrodt is committed to being a force for good. Our social impact strategy focuses on improving the health and well-being of patients, building stronger communities, and empowering our employees to dedicate their time and resources to the causes they care about most. We provide grants to nonprofits worldwide and support employees with their own philanthropy through volunteerism and giving programs. 
Corporate Charitable Giving Program 
Mallinckrodt provides patient-related and philanthropic support to nonprofit organizations that are aligned with our mission to address unmet needs with innovative solutions. Our patient-centric charitable contributions support initiatives and programs that have broad public benefit and advance medical care and/or patient care within the Company's therapeutic areas of focus. Our community-
based investments are centered in three strategic areas: (i) improving health and wellness; (ii) advancing science, technology, engineering and mathematics ("STEM") education; and (iii) stimulating jobs and economic growth in life sciences. 
Mallinckrodt continues to focus efforts on advancing health equity and improving outcomes for underrepresented communities. We collaborate with patient advocacy organizations to improve engagement with these communities and promote greater awareness of health disparities in our key therapeutic areas of focus. For example, Mallinckrodt supported:
•NephCure Kidney International's Health Equity and Diversity Initiative aimed at creating more equitable access to research and care for underrepresented individuals living with, or are at high risk of developing, chronic kidney diseases. 
•The Myositis Association’s Affinity Groups program to amplify patient voices, equity and access, and create safe spaces for communities that share more in common than their myositis.
•The American Liver Foundation’s Think Liver Think Life national public health campaign that focuses on awareness and screening of liver disease. 
We supported STEM education helping to expanded opportunities for female and minority students, further closing the gap in access for these underrepresented groups. Examples of 2022 grant support include:
•Students 2 Science, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that inspires and educates students in underserved communities to pursue STEM careers. 
•Maydm, Inc., a nonprofit in Madison, Wisconsin that provides girls and youth of color in grades 6-12 with skill-based training in STEM fields.

Employee Giving and Volunteerism

Our volunteerism program provides eight hours of extra paid time off to eligible employees annually for qualified volunteer activities, in addition to time off to participate in our global month of service that's held every October.
