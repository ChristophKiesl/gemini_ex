We are currently limited to distribution of the products through our online platform, www.GridironMVP.com; we currently have no other distribution channels or partners and have had very limited sales of any of our products.

Operating Strategy and Goals
 
In order for us to continue to implement our model, we have identified the following milestones that we are seeking to achieve:
 

Identify and Secure a Broker Network. We plan to identify and secure working relationships with a national broker network that can expand distribution of our products. We anticipate a considerable amount of travel and ongoing expenses to be incurred as part of this milestone. To date, we have not identified or secured a broker network and there can be no assurance we will be successful in doing so.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identify and Secure Manufacturing. We intend to identify and secure one to two co-packer facilities, strategically located meet future growth objectives and to meet anticipated volumes by product type and future growth objectives. 
Capital Considerations - Our business plan can be adjusted based on the available capital to the business.

· | We believe cash on hand will adequately fund our current planned operations and capital needs for the next 12 months. However, if our current plans change or are accelerated, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, including seeking investments from strategic investors. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

The milestones set forth above reflect our current judgment and belief regarding the direction of our business. Actual events, expenditures and results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections or assumptions suggested herein.
 
Marketing
 
Our products are currently marketed through our online website www.gridironmvp.com. We currently have no marketing agreement(s) with third party marketing groups.
 
Product Manufacturing and Fulfillment
 
We currently rely on third party manufacturers and fulfillment. We currently have no contract or agreement with manufacturers or fulfillment centers. We plan to identify manufactures and fulfillment centers that can provide quality and efficiency in the development and delivery of our products. We currently store our inventory in a temperature-controlled facility in Utah.
 
In February 2020, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Notis Global, Inc. whereby we purchased 2,500,000,000 shares of common stock Company that included a Collaboration Agreement, dated January 24, 2020. Under the Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Notis Global “will collaboratively explore and consider potential business opportunities for the parties within various segments of the hemp CBD supply chain including cultivation, extraction and purification and retail products.” To date, there have been no opportunities identified through this collaboration with Notis Global.
 
In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Shi Farms entered into a Supply Agreement, dated January 27, 2020, pursuant to which Shi Farms agreed to sell the Company 30,000 pounds of hemp biomass at a purchase price of $5.00 per pound. The hemp biomass must contain a minimum of 6% total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all hemp biomass must have less than 3% total TCH content. The hemp biomass must contain no contaminates that are above acceptable industry standards for processing hemp biomass including but not limited to: mold and mildew, non-hemp plant material, soil, insects, rodent droppings, wet or rotting material, heavy metals, residual pesticides or herbicides, or bacteria. Either party may terminate the Supply Agreement prior to delivery of the hemp biomass. The collaboration and supply agreement(s) have produced no revenues to the company this year. We have on inventory approximately 77 liters of THC-Free CBD Distillate as a result of the collaboration agreement.
 
Competition
 
Competition within the CBD industry is intense with many well-established companies within the market, such as Charlotte’s Web Holdings Inc., PureKana, cbdMD, Inc., Tilray and Hexo Corp., and numerous start-up companies entering the market. Substantially all of the Company’s competitors are established companies with brand name recognition and far greater resources than Gridiron. While the Company is not presently able to effectively compete with these larger, more established companies as a result of its limited resources and lack of brand name recognition by consumers, subject to the availability of sufficient funds Gridiron seeks to brand and market high quality CBD products through both exclusive and non-exclusive strategic alliances that will serve to make the Company a market leader, which will be in direct competition with the above companies. However, the Company can provide no assurance or guarantee that it will be able to develop and/or maintain any strategic alliances now or in the future or that its products will be accepted by the market.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. We do not own any patents nor do we have any patents pending
 
The Company has filed four trademark applications with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) as follows:
 

· | 87594229 - GRIDIRON BIONUTRIENTS in international class 005 (supplements)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 87594267 - GRIDIRON MVP in international class 005 (supplements) 
· | 87594303 - GRIDIRON BIONUTRIENTS in international class 032 (beverages) 
· | 87594316 - GRIDIRON MVP in international class 032 (beverages) 

 
There are no assurances that these trademarks will be granted or that we will be able to effectively protect any of our intellectual property. 
 
We are reliant on our domain name, www.GridironMVP, to market our products. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain name or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.

Government Regulation
 
The production of our hemp extract products is contingent on U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and state laws, regulations, and guidance. While the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 removed hemp from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the law did not change the FDA’s authorities with respect to food or drugs. As of the date of this annual report, the FDA has not made a determination that the use of hemp extract in food is safe. The FDA has evaluated Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) notices for four hemp seed-derived food ingredients and determined that the agency has no questions that those ingredients are GRAS under their intended conditions of use. In the event the FDA issues appropriate regulations or guidance or determines that it has no questions that hemp extract is GRAS under intended conditions of use that would permit us to market hemp extract in water without food additive approval. We may decide to market Gridiron BioNutrients™ and GridironMVP™ in any states, districts or territories if applicable laws allow for such sale or if a supplier meets and complies with the FDA’s GRAS regulations with respect to a self-certification regarding the safety and GRAS status of the use of hemp extract. We may change the composition of our planned hemp-extract-infused product as necessary to comply with federal, state or local laws, regulations or guidance.
 
The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our products will be subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.
 
Legal requirements apply in many jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing, and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary and are constantly evolving. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at the local, state and federal levels in the United States.
 
Any third-party bottling facility that we may choose to utilize in the future and any other such operations will be subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. It will be our policy to comply with any and all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Human Capital
 
Timothy S. Orr was the sole officer, director and employee of the Company during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. As part of the Acquisition, Mr. Orr, stepped down as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and assumed the role of the Company’s Interim Chief Financial Officer, a position he agreed to maintain for a period of at least six months. Mr. Orr will remain a director of the Company.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Jeffrey J. Kraws was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. In addition, the Company agreed to appoint Jason Frankovich as a director of the Company subject to the Company’s compliance with Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. Provided we have the resources, we intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. We believe that the skill set of our current management is adequate for the current and short-term development of our brands and trademarks.
