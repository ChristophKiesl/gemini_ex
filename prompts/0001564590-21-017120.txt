Item 1. Business.
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, founded in 2017, focused on the discovery and development of oral therapeutics for patients with autoimmune diseases that are the first to target new mechanisms of action, including the LANCL2, NLRX1 and PLXDC2 immunometabolic pathways. Our core expertise is in the development of therapeutic candidates targeting novel pathways at the interface of immunity and metabolism. Based on our understanding of the role that a cell’s metabolic pathways have on modulating inflammatory responses, we aim to inhibit these inflammatory responses by changing the metabolic processes in target cells. We leverage our proprietary AI-based precision medicine platform, our LANCE platform, to identify novel therapeutic targets based on predictions of immunometabolic function and create therapeutic candidates to engage those targets in areas of unmet medical need. Through our LANCE platform, we have identified seven novel immunometabolic targets and product candidates to date across 14 indications, including ulcerative colitis, or UC, Crohn’s disease, or CD, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, diabetic nephropathy and type 1 diabetes. Our initial focus is the development of BT-11 and NX-13 for the treatment of UC and CD.
 We expect to commence an integrated Phase 3 trial of BT-11 in UC patients in the United States, Russia, Asia, and Europe in 2021, subject to review of the complete Phase 2 data and FDA feedback, and we expect to discuss with the FDA the pathway for further development of BT-11 in UC patients. We believe the therapeutics we discover and develop, if approved, will have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. 
 We have completed a Phase 1a trial of NX-13 in normal healthy volunteers and identified a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, that was 10-fold greater than the targeted therapeutic dose, without presentation of serious adverse events. Based on these data, we expect to commence a Phase 1b trial of NX-13 in patients with UC in 2021.
 Background in autoimmune diseases 
 Autoimmune diseases generally result from the loss of self-tolerance in the immune system, causing the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues. This leads to inflammation of the organs and tissues, causing chronic pain and deterioration or destruction of the ability of these organs to function. Current therapies either broadly prevent the immune system from functioning, in the case of corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, or ASA, and immunosuppressants, or systemically block specific molecules that promote inflammation in the case of biologics and JAK inhibitors. While great strides have been made, existing approaches continue to leave unmet patient need, due in part to significant safety concerns. 
 Our approach 
 Our mission is to create safe and effective therapeutic candidates to engage targets in areas of unmet medical need where current treatments have limited efficacy and safety and tolerability concerns. To pursue this mission, we are developing novel, disease-specific oral therapeutic candidates that are designed to address the therapeutic gap in the current treatment paradigm for autoimmune diseases. We leverage our AI-based integrated computational and experimental LANCE platform to discover novel therapeutic targets based on prediction and validation of immunometabolic function. Through our LANCE platform, we have identified novel pathways that stand at immunometabolic intersections of multiple well-established immune processes. We believe these pathways have a greater potential to restore the immune tolerance that is lost in patients with autoimmune disease. 
 We begin our discovery process with an in silico target discovery and drug development platform. The LANCE precision medicine platform analyzes large datasets from autoimmune disease patients to identify novel expression patterns tied to regulatory functions and ranks and prioritizes new immunometabolic targets that are perturbed in human disease and have high potential to serve as selective portals to the coordination of multiple well-categorized downstream responses tied to autoimmune diseases. We then continue evaluation in silico, identifying thousands of targets within the human immune system to evaluate and refine possibilities to maximize efficiency of time and cost. We include multi-scale modeling of immune and disease processes in virtual representation of target tissues for a specific disease to prioritize targets capable of exerting control on the immune response to a level providing meaningful change at the tissue and clinical level. In parallel, targets are filtered for druggability and safety 
 1


parameters, removing those that are difficult to activate or inhibit or have potential to be linked to toxicity. We prioritize selection of targets with applicable mechanisms to numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases while generating predictions for disease-specific potency and optimal pharmacokinetic, or PK, profiles. We then conduct experimental target validation of top ranked targets in cells and in mouse models of disease using loss-of-function and constitutive expression methods. Upon successful target validation, an internal medicinal chemistry program is initiated to optimize preliminary scaffolds into leads. We evaluate lead compounds through a series of in-house robust target engagement, in vitro culture, multiple animal models for diseases of interest, PK evaluation, preliminary dose range finding, or DRF, toxicity studies in rats and translational studies in human patient samples. We have used this strategy to identify, evaluate and advance seven product candidates across three targets spanning numerous autoimmune and related disorders. Prioritization of these product candidates occurs based on unmet clinical need, therapeutic market size and opportunity, preclinical safety and efficacy data, and performance in translational biomarkers. 
 Optimally identifying novel immunometabolic targets with our proprietary LANCE platform 
 We believe our LANCE platform may have several key advantages as compared to traditional drug discovery technologies used in autoimmune diseases, including improved discovery and significant target generation potential, ability to modulate multiple critical pathways via a single target, and cost advantage. We have leveraged our platform to identify seven novel immunometabolic targets to date, two of which we are evaluating in clinical trials, LANCL2 and NLRX1. Using our LANCE platform, we expect to identify further novel targets and develop new product candidates for additional indications such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, NASH, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetic nephropathy, asthma, psoriasis, EoE and COPD, with the potential to submit one to two investigational new drug applications, or INDs, per year over the next five years, including at least three new INDs in 2021. 
 Our portfolio 
 We are leveraging our LANCE platform, our proprietary computational target discovery engine, to design and develop a pipeline of oral small molecule product candidates with differentiated profiles that are the first to target novel immunometabolic mechanisms to address autoimmune diseases. We currently own worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our product candidates. Since our inception, we successfully cleared four INDs with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We expect to submit at least three additional

INDs by the end of 2021. Our ability to execute on our strategy of advancing development of our product candidates will depend on the results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials. 
 

 
* | Subject to feedback from the FDA, we intend to initially submit one IND for each product candidate in order to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials in an indication. We will submit subsequent INDs to proceed to Phase 1 clinical trials in additional indications for that product candidate.

** | We define the discovery stage of development as the design, initial synthesis, target binding and preliminary pharmacology testing in in vitro and animal models of disease; the preclinical stage of development as GLP-toxicity and pharmacology studies, metabolism and pharmacokinetics in addition to scale-up chemistry manufacturing and controls for drug substance and drug product; the Phase 1 stage as clinical trials designed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers or small patient cohorts; the Phase 2 stage as placebo-controlled clinical trials designed to provide proof-of-concept efficacy in the target patient population; and the Phase 3 stage as clinical trials designed to provide the final supporting data for the safety and effectiveness of a drug in the proposed indication to support an NDA filing.

 Numerous anticipated milestones in our portfolio are currently in preparation. For BT-11, a Phase 3 clinical trial in UC is expected to be initiated in the second half of 2021, subject to review of the complete Phase 2 data and FDA feedback, a Phase 2 clinical trial of BT-11 in CD will be initiated in the first half of 2021, an IND filing of BT-11 in EoE has reached FDA clearance, and IND filings of BT-11 in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis will occur in 2021. For NX-13, a Phase 1b clinical trial in UC is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2021 and a Phase 2 clinical trial in CD is expected to be initiated in 2022, respectively. For BT-104, IND-enabling studies are expected to be completed in 2021. For PX-69, IND-enabling studies are expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.

The successful clinical development of our product candidates is dependent on many factors beyond our control, including timely and successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials required to progress our clinical programs, and the sufficiency of our financial and other internal and external resources to complete such studies and trials, file INDs and NDAs, as appropriate, and commercialize BT-11 for UC, effective INDs from the FDA or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials for discovery or preclinical-stage product candidates, receipt of timely marketing approvals from the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, our ability to successfully launch commercial sales of any approved product candidates, whether independently or with partners and our ability to produce and approved product candidates on a commercial scale. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates,” “Risk factors—Risks related to our dependence on third parties” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - Liquidity and capital resources.” 
 BT-11 program overview
Our lead product candidate, BT-11, a gut-restricted oral therapeutic that is the first candidate designed to engage the novel target lanthionine synthetase C-like protein 2, or LANCL2, a membrane receptor that has been shown to modulate immunological mechanisms that are associated with autoimmune diseases such as UC or CD. Approximately 2 million Americans suffer from UC or CD, and the treatment of these two diseases in the United States accounts for an aggregate annual market size of up to $17 billion. There are currently no approved treatments targeting LANCL2. BT-11 is designed to act locally in the gastrointestinal tract for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD. We have designed BT-11 to overcome limitations of existing therapies, including with respect to side effect profile, route of administration (injectables) and sustained efficacy. 
 We have completed the induction phase of a Phase 2 clinical trial of BT-11 for mild to moderate UC in the United States, Russia and Europe. We expect to commence an integrated Phase 3 trial of BT-11 in UC patients in the United States, Russia, Asia, and Europe in 2021, subject to review of the complete Phase 2 data and FDA feedback, and we expect to discuss with the FDA the pathway for further development of BT-11 in UC patients. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial of BT-11 for the treatment of moderate to severe CD in the first half of 2021. We believe that BT-11, if approved, has the potential to disrupt the treatment paradigm in IBD. In UC, we believe BT-11 has the potential to be utilized as a pre-biologic therapy for mild-to-moderate cases, where 70% to 80% of the patient population exists, due to its novel mechanism of action and tolerability profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed in preclinical studies in doses up to 7-fold higher than the proposed clinical therapeutic dose. In CD, we believe that BT-11, if approved, has the potential to serve as a first-line therapy and treat patients prior to their progression into biologics by addressing the main limitations of current therapeutics. We believe that an oral, gut-restricted small molecule delivered once daily in a singular tablet could serve as a first-line therapy in the moderate to severe CD treatment paradigm. 
 NX-13 program overview
Our second product candidate, NX-13, is a novel, gut-restricted oral therapeutic that targets NOD-like receptor X1, or NLRX1, a mitochondria-associated receptor that has been associated with the modulation of inflammatory cytokines for UC and CD. There are currently no approved NLRX1-based drugs. NX-13 is designed to target NLRX1 in order to induce anti-inflammatory effects in CD4+ T cells and other immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract. We believe that, if approved, NX-13 could provide an additional treatment option for the up to 50% of UC patients that experience relapse within one year of current therapies and up to 55% of CD patients that relapse within one year of achieving active remission. Mechanistically, NX-13 could provide improvements in fibrosis. We believe NX-13 offers the potential, both as a single agent and in combination with other therapeutics, to address the unmet medical need in UC and CD. We have completed a Phase 1a trial of NX-13 in normal healthy volunteers and identified a MTD that was 10-fold greater than the targeted therapeutic dose, without presentation of serious adverse events. Based on these data, we expect to commence a Phase 1b trial of NX-13 in patients with UC in 2021.
 Autoimmune market opportunity 
 We are developing therapeutics for the large and growing autoimmune disease market, which is expected to reach $153 billion by 2025. Our lead product candidates target a multi-billion dollar market opportunity across 13 different indications. 
 4


The UC and CD markets are currently dominated by biologic drugs that generated up to $17 billion in U.S. sales in 2019. From 2010 to 2020, the IBD market experienced a compound annual growth rate of 13.1%. Approximately 35% of patients treated with biologics fail to enter remission. Meanwhile, greater than 90% of UC patients with active disease have mild to moderate disease and 50% to 60% of IBD patients are biologic naïve. Current market competition in this space is limited to aminosalicylates, steroids and immunosuppressants which have only low efficacy in induction and maintenance of clinical remission. The primary competition in development, falling into two primary classes (JAK inhibitors, S1P modulators), targets a moderate to severe patient population that is primarily comprised of patients who have not responded to biologics, due to inherent safety concerns with these classes. With the exception of Xeljanz, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of UC, oral agents approved for IBD are limited to aminosalicylates, steroids and immunosuppressants that have limited efficacy. We believe we have the potential to address the large IBD market and specific therapeutic gaps in both UC and CD. However, there is no guarantee that any of our product candidates will be approved by the FDA and, even if approved, there is no guarantee that our product candidates will earn revenues comparable to Entyvio, Humira or Stelara. The graphic and table below depict the large market opportunity in IBD.

 Our strengths 
 We believe we are a leader in the discovery of targets through novel multi-modal pathways at the interface of immunity and metabolism. Through our proprietary LANCE precision medicine platform, we have pioneered a promising drug development engine underpinned by advanced computational capabilities applied to the discovery of new therapeutic targets for autoimmune disease. 
 Our distinctive strengths include: 
  
• | We are pioneering a new treatment paradigm in immunometabolism based on novel pathways. Historically, innovation in autoimmune drug discovery has focused on the same known targets creating new molecules whose development has been hampered by toxicity issues connected to the mechanism of action or systemic pathways and which have provided only marginal change to efficacy at best. The late-stage development pipeline in IBD can be summarized by JAK/STAT-, cytokine- and adhesion-based mechanisms of action, while our lead product candidate, BT-11, is the most advanced immunometabolic asset in clinical development. Our unique ability to identify novel targets that intersect and provide upstream control of established inflammatory and regulatory pathways supports a clinical path to develop novel drugs. We are further leveraging these novel immunometabolic targets in a disease-specific way with an aim to provide better and more precise care to patients.

• | We have discovered and are developing several clinical-stage assets across the LANCL2 and NLRX1 pathways through our LANCE platform and distinctive capabilities. To date, we have identified seven novel immunometabolic targets, of which candidates that target two (LANCL2 and NLRX1) have progressed into the clinic. Our lead asset, BT-11, is an orally-active, gut-restricted, small molecule that is the first therapeutic candidate to target the LANCL2 pathway. We have completed the induction phase of a Phase 2 clinical trial of BT-11 for mild to moderate UC in the United States, Russia and Europe. Based on this trial data, we expect to commence an integrated Phase 3 trial of BT-11 in UC patients in the United States, Russia, Asia, and Europe in the second half of 2021, subject to review of the complete Phase 2 data and FDA feedback, and we expect to discuss with the FDA the pathway for further development of BT-11 in UC patients. We also expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial of BT-11 for the treatment of moderate to severe CD in the first half of 2021. Our second asset, NX-13, targets the NLRX1 pathway and has completed Phase 1a clinical testing without presentation of serious adverse events and a MTD that was 10-fold greater than the targeted therapeutic dose. Based on these data, we expect to commence a Phase 1b trial of NX-13 in patients with UC in 2021.

• | We are developing product candidates with novel mechanisms of action and the potential for use as monotherapy or combination therapy to address therapeutic gaps for IBD patients where current treatments have limited efficacy and safety and tolerability concerns. We believe the LANCL2 pathway is not targeted by any other drug in development for IBD. With a dual effect for pro-regulatory and anti-inflammatory signaling,

targeting this pathway may offer a unique advantage for longer maintenance of clinical remission, decreasing the high flare rates in IBD. We believe BT-11, if approved, has the potential to disrupt the treatment paradigm in UC as a pre-biologic therapy for mild-to-moderate cases, where greater than 90% of the patient population with active disease exists, due to its novel mechanism of action and no dose-limiting toxicities in doses up to 7-fold higher than the currently proposed therapeutic dose in our completed Phase 1 clinical trial. Additionally, BT-11 and NX-13 are designed to offer a convenient, once-daily oral dose which we believe may provide competitive advantage over the injectable, systemically distributed biologics. Given the novel targets and limited toxicities, we believe BT-11 and NX-13 have potential to be used as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies in IBD.

• | We are targeting several indications characterized by unmet medical need and therapeutic gaps that represent a broad market opportunity. We are developing therapeutics for the large and growing autoimmune disease market, which is expected to reach $153 billion by 2025. Our lead product candidates target a multi-billion dollar market opportunity across 13 different indications. The global UC market was $5.3 billion in 2016, and is expected to grow at a 2.5% compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2026. The global CD market is estimated at approximately $12 billion and expected to grow at 4% compound annual growth rate between 2019 and 2022. We believe these indications provide a large market opportunity with no established satisfactory standard of care. The primary competition in development targets a moderate-to-severe patient population that is primarily comprised of patients refractory to biologics, due to inherent safety concerns within these classes. Many key opinion leaders expect oral agents to expand the overall autoimmune disease therapeutic market size and accelerate growth in the IBD space. We believe our product candidates, if approved, have the potential to address the large autoimmune disease therapeutic market and specific therapeutic gaps in both UC and CD. Our broad therapeutic pipeline is comprised of potential valuable treatments for other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes, as well as other indications with immunometabolic components, such as NASH, Alzheimer’s disease, and asthma.

 Our strategy 
 As a leader in the development of therapeutic candidates addressing immunometabolic mechanisms of action, we believe we are distinctly positioned to advance the discovery and development of potentially safer and more effective novel therapeutics for autoimmune diseases. We are targeting indications characterized by high unmet clinical need, significant likelihood of success in clinical development and the ability to improve the quality of life for large patient populations. Our strategy consists of the following key components: 
  
• | Maximize and capture value in our LANCE platform by discovering and developing oral therapeutics that are the first to target novel immunometabolic pathways to improve the lives of patients with autoimmune diseases. We have leveraged our experience in immunology and therapeutic development, underpinned by the guidance of our clinical advisory board, to build the LANCE platform. We will apply our proprietary artificial intelligence, or AI, and advanced computational modeling capabilities to continue to identify novel therapeutic targets based on predictions of immunometabolic function. Through our LANCE platform, we have progressed BT-11 from initial discovery to an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in less than three years, and in a capital efficient manner. In addition to LANCL2, NLRX1, and PLXDC2, the LANCE platform has identified four new targets in early preclinical stages of development. We have led the discovery of the immunometabolic mechanisms for these three targets independently of external research and possess the capacity to internally discover novel targets. We intend to continue to leverage the LANCE platform to further advance a pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The LANCE platform has served and, we believe, will continue to serve in the generation of a seamless therapeutic pipeline ranging from early preclinical to lead selection to clinical development and commercialization.

NLRX1 is a novel target at the intersection of the pathogenesis of IBD with the ability to modulate multiple associated complications including deficiencies in the epithelial barrier, interactions with the gut microbiome and underlying inflammation. We have completed a Phase 1a clinical testing of NX-13, and we expect to commence a Phase 1b trial of NX-13 in patients with UC in 2021. We intend to explore NX-13 both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics for the treatment of UC and CD.

• | Continue to develop a franchise of oral therapies from our deep preclinical pipeline of product candidates targeting immunometabolic pathways identified by our LANCE platform. Recognizing the applicability of our novel targets across a range of autoimmune conditions, and the benefits to patients of disease specific molecules, we intend to advance each of our preclinical assets to exploit the full potential of each pathway or target. We are building upon our precision medicine approach to develop disease-specific molecules by exploring the use of biomarkers to identify patients more likely to benefit from therapies. BT-104, BT-111, NX-66, NX-73 and PX-69 have been identified as possible valuable treatments for autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes, as well as other indications with immunometabolic components, such as NASH, Alzheimer’s disease, and asthma. We expect to file at least one to two INDs per year over the next five years, including three new INDs in 2021.

• | Maximize the commercial value of our therapeutic pipeline. We have retained worldwide commercial rights to all of our therapeutic programs. We intend to continue advancing more clinical candidates in various therapeutic areas independently. We plan to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company by selecting promising programs in specialty pharmaceutical and orphan indications for internal development and commercialization and developing a commercial arm to capture value for shareholders. We will also pursue territory deals that enable partnering on commercialization of lead therapeutic assets outside of the U.S. and European markets. Moreover, we will consider partnering with strategics to develop some of the follow on therapeutic assets as a means of monetizing some of our pipeline assets.

 Background on immunometabolism 
 Alterations in the concentration of metabolic enzymes and substrates in the cell often precede changes in the expression of genes that articulate inflammatory responses in autoimmune diseases. These metabolic processes are critical determinants of the function of immune cells. In the course of autoimmune diseases, multiple receptors transmit information about the environment through pathways at the intersection of immunity and metabolism. Over the past decade, this field of study, known as immunometabolism, has revealed the complex metabolic pathways that underlie autoimmune response in disease and has allowed us to focus on developing ways to manipulate these regulatory networks to enhance and control immunity.
 Genes with inflammatory functions, such as TNF or IL-6, tend to be overexpressed during autoimmune responses and are easily identified. The metabolic pathways of immune cells must also be configured to meet the demands of their function. For example, the pro-inflammatory subset of immune cells known as T-effector cells (Th1 and Th17) depend upon glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, while cells involved in anti-inflammatory response known as regulatory T-cells utilize predominately fatty acid oxidation. However, genes with immunometabolic roles experience modest change in expression levels though they are critical in modulating inflammation. By altering the signals that drive differentiation and the metabolic pathways that support it, immune tolerance can be reestablished in patients where there is immune dysregulation, such as in autoimmune disease. 
 We are focused on developing therapeutic interventions based on activating molecular targets within these immunometabolic pathways to correct aberrant inflammatory responses. We have developed an AI platform that allows for efficient identification, segregation and prioritization of these genes from high throughput datasets. This platform is designed to differentiate our program of target discovery and product development.

Our LANCE platform 
 We have built our LANCE precision medicine platform to identify novel targets at the intersection of immunity and metabolism and to develop new therapeutic products for these new targets. Our innovative approach to immunometabolism applies proprietary AI and advanced computational modeling to identify novel therapeutic targets based on predictions of immunometabolic function and create therapeutics to engage those targets in areas of unmet medical need. Upon target discovery, we have efficient medicinal chemistry and preclinical capabilities, as evidenced by the less than 24 months from discovery to Phase 1 initiation with BT-11 and less than 18 months from discovery to Phase 1 initiation with NX-13. Our development time from discovery to Phase 2 ready was 30 months, in the case of BT-11, and 24 months, in the case of NX-13. Using our LANCE platform, we expect to submit one to two INDs per year over the next five years, including at least three INDs in 2021. We believe similar timelines are possible with future product candidates; however, the process of clinical development is inherently uncertain and no guarantee can be made that similar timelines will be achieved. 
 We have successfully leveraged this iterative process to identify seven novel immunometabolic targets to date, and product candidates which are designed to target two such targets, LANCL2 and NLRX1, have begun clinical trials pursuant to INDs. Using our LANCE platform, we not only expect to identify further novel targets but to also continue to develop disease-specific product candidates for indications such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, NASH, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, EoE, psoriasis, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetic nephropathy, asthma and COPD. We believe our innovative precision medicine approach, in which we develop specific products for disease states, enhances our ability to address existing unmet need for patients. 
 We developed our proprietary LANCE platform to revolutionize the target identification, prioritization and selection process as well as facilitate the development of new therapeutic products for those targets. Our leadership team has deep experience in this field, including Dr. Bassaganya-Riera, a pioneer in computational immunology and precision medicine. The team has published over 30 computationally- and AI-focused peer-reviewed publications, such as in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and PLOS Computational Biology, and has created foundational large-scale models of the immune system, including one of the most widely used ordinary differential equation-based model of CD4+ T cell, or Treg, differentiation. The LANCE platform embodies the re-focusing of this know-how into the application of drug development for autoimmune disease. 
 Processes of our platform 
 The LANCE platform is an innovation engine that uses four main processes to identify novel therapeutic immunometabolic pathways with significant potential to exert immunoregulatory control of autoimmune disease: 
  
• | Data extraction. We extract data from both proprietary and public omics datasets from human diseases with defined categorical data tied to responders and non-responders, active disease versus remission, and trends and signature patterns over the progression of disease. The output is a disease-agnostic composite database of autoimmune diseases with over 10,000 potential targets. We continually update this database, resulting in new opportunities to identify pathways and the ability to enhance the robustness of previous predictions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Computational target analysis. We use proprietary AI-based approaches to analyze our database, compiling and inferring hidden blind spots and linkages in signaling networks that may serve as understudied, yet potent, portals into modulating immunometabolism. Our blind spot algorithm specializes in identifying the targets for which the connections to known downstream functional events were previously undiscovered. The output is a ranked priority list of 80 to 100 targets based on relative impact on prominent immune and metabolic pathways. Based on the weighting of individual pathways and subsetting of data analytical methods, the system is versatile enough to offer cross-validation potential and continuous mining of the high-dimensional data.

• | In silico immune system modeling. We perform multiscale modeling of the immune system to link molecular signaling to changes in overall tissue and patient level responses to prioritize targets within a specific disease. The output is narrowed down to five to ten targets identified to have significant in silico impact on intricately calibrated models of human autoimmune disease that capture complex interactions between molecules and cells in disease-specific target tissues. This encompasses the colon for UC and CD, the entire gastrointestinal tract for CD, synovium for rheumatoid arthritis, lung for asthma and COPD, brain for multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, pancreas for type 1 diabetes, liver and adipose tissue for NASH, and germinal centers and sites of immune complex reactions in spleen, kidney, circulation and a variety of other organs for lupus, and kidney for diabetic nephropathy.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The result is selection of two to three targets preclinically validated to impact disease pathogenesis, for which medicinal chemistry programs can be established. The graphic below summarizes the selection process of our LANCE platform. 
 

Foundations of the LANCE platform 
 Across autoimmune disease, the current therapeutic strategy is often the same: block a single cytokine, use a broadly immunosuppressive steroid and alter lymphocyte trafficking. We believe this paradigm fails to effectively modulate the massively and dynamically interacting immunological network to provide sustained therapeutic responses during autoimmune disease. As a result, patients that are non-responsive to one class of drugs have a low likelihood to respond to other classes due to the similarity between classes. In addition, despite chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, relapse and flare rates in all autoimmune diseases are high. In UC and CD, half of patients relapse within a year of starting treatment. In rheumatoid arthritis, 90% or more fail to achieve extended remission. In systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, and multiple sclerosis, frequent steroid regimens are needed to address flares.

To address the limitations of current therapies for autoimmune diseases, we utilize our LANCE platform to develop therapeutics based on the following foundational pillars: 
 Targeting immunometabolism.    An abundance of recent evidence supports that the function and phenotype of immune cells, inclusive of both innate and adaptive immune response, is highly conserved and intertwined with metabolic processes. The synthesis of building blocks for cytokines, antibodies and lipid mediators, the preparation for proliferation, the processes of phagocytosis and autophagy, and the generation of long-enduring memory cells require differential metabolism. The therapeutic manipulation of cellular metabolism is a robust multimodal mechanism to shift the balance between effector and regulatory immune cells. These strategies have resulted in resounding successes in the fields of immuno-oncology (such as pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1, ritonavir, a protease inhibitor, and everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor) and metabolism (such as metformin, an antidiabetic, and statins, lipid-lowering drugs) but remain a yet unexploited opportunity in autoimmune disease. With a multitude of genetic instability characterizing autoimmune disease patients, therapeutics targeting well-conserved and stable immunometabolic processes could prove a successful strategy for therapeutic efficacy. 
 Prioritizing patient safety.    We have prioritized the development of product candidates targeting LANCL2 and NLRX1 based not only on potent anti-inflammatory effects observed in preclinical studies but also on the observed ability to modulate their signaling without dose-limiting toxicities in completed nonclinical and clinical studies. For BT-11, NX-13 and other product candidates in our pipeline, the primary mechanism of action is designed to result in the activation of immunoregulatory effects, as opposed to complete inhibition of natural immunological processes. As a result, our product candidates are designed to result in a functional immune system in which self-tolerance and immune homeostasis are restored. For the majority of autoimmune diseases, including UC and CD, safety concerns are a primary cause of gaps in the treatment paradigm between patients with mild disease severity and patients treated with biologics and other treatment classes with “black-box” label safety warnings. 
 Restoring immune tolerance.    We view the immune system as a massively and dynamically interacting complex system. By inhibiting single cytokines and narrow pathways, multiple compensatory mechanisms can emerge, making any therapeutic improvement in disease short-lived. Each of our lead targets is designed to induce regulatory mechanisms that are conserved, meaning the mechanisms have specific effects on intended pathways. These mechanisms are multi-pronged and are tied to contact-mediated suppression, production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, and metabolic changes favorable to Tregs; all of which may drive more durable clinical response and remission. 
 Identifying novel pathways.    A primary objective of our LANCE platform is to identify novel pathways with conserved multi-pronged mechanisms with the potential to elicit effects beyond those observed in current classes of drugs targeting autoimmune disease. In particular, our process focuses on identifying central nodes in the network which emanate multiple spokes to coordinate downstream responses. For example, the activation of LANCL2 interacts with CD25/STAT5 signaling, decreases late-stage glycolysis while enhancing oxidative phosphorylation, and influences secondary messenger signaling. Based on our robust dataset, we believe this coordination will enhance the robustness of response to our product candidates through built-in redundancies capable of maintaining coordination should one spoke be rendered non-functional due to a disease-associated mutation in a specific patient. Despite the novelty of the target and certain downstream pathways, our validation is rooted in well-categorized biomarkers of inflammation, including decreases in TNF expression, NF-κB activity, or fecal calprotectin levels with the activation of LANCL2 and NLRX1. We believe elucidation of these well-validated downstream anchors increases the confidence for the translation of preclinical results when targeting our novel pathways. To date, we 
 11


have identified seven novel pathways using the LANCE platform with promising potential to innovate the treatment of autoimmune disease. 
 

Benefits of our LANCE platform 
 We believe our LANCE platform has several key advantages, including: 
  
• | Improved drug discovery paradigm in autoimmune diseases: Our LANCE platform is designed to achieve an efficient discovery timeline, from target identification to lead compound in under 12 months. Our seven identified candidates have moved to in vitro and in vivo studies without a single discontinuation for observations related to toxicity, efficacy or non-druggability. Finally, customizable in silico analysis to identify targets agnostically as overall regulators of immunology or focused on a particular indication of interest broadens the breadth of our opportunities to a series of new potential indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modulating multiple critical pathways via a single target: The LANCE platform provides the potential ability to identify candidates which could coordinate multiple cellular processes into the same overall phenotype to reduce compensatory mechanisms tied to loss of response. The LANCE platform provides robust, well-conserved potential targets in an autoimmune disease space associated with high patient-to-patient variability. The ability to modulate multiple primary targets and several escape mechanisms offers the potential to identify candidates which could be developed to provide a more durable effect of therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost advantage and meaningful target generation potential: Given the demonstrated capital efficiency of the initial drug development programs we have undertaken to date, we believe our LANCE platform is likely to continue providing for a decrease in discovery and development costs relative to licensing new product candidates as we advance the timeline of discovery to IND. We also believe the LANCE platform may provide meaningful potential to discover new targets and re-prioritize identified targets with continually evolving input data. Streamlined target selection and prioritized list of selected targets may also minimize time and cost dedicated to discovery stage. A rational and efficient product prioritization from the large targets pool offered by our platform is bolstered by efficacy studies with two or more animal models, by toxicity and PK data with target tissue engagement in mice, rats and pigs, as well as by the availability of translational biomarkers to make early preclinical and clinical go/no-go decisions. We are targeting indications characterized by high unmet clinical need, significant likelihood of success in clinical development and market size opportunity.

Our LANCL2 pathway product candidates 
 The LANCL2 pathway 
 The LANCL2 receptor triggers a unique reaction at the interface of immunity and metabolism. LANCL2 is a surface membrane-associated receptor and one of three members of the LANCL family, which have been previously studied in detail. Our analysis with the LANCE platform has produced a deeper understanding of the role of the LANCL2 pathway in modulating key cellular and molecular genes tied to autoimmune disease. More specifically, activation of LANCL2 is designed to intercept autoimmune disease at multiple levels through extensively-characterized pathways and signaling molecules, including decrease of inflammation-promoting TNFα, IFNγ, IL-6 and MCP1 and increase in regulatory Tregs anti-inflammatory activities. 
 Given the differential metabolic preferences of Th1 and Th17 versus Treg cells, whereby the former prefer glycolytic pathways versus the latter prefer oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy, the rewiring of metabolism between oxidative and glycolytic metabolic pathways mediated by LANCL2 activation is designed to produce a functional switch in immune cells that promotes regulatory functions. For instance, highly proliferative effector cells associated with autoimmune reactions produce strongly inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IFNγ, and differentiate into effector Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cell subsets. Both of these events are associated with lactate, the key metabolite of anaerobic glycolysis. In contrast, when LANCL2 is activated, it promotes the function of enzymes that diminish lactate and favor oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic switch is supportive of stable expression of FOXP3, the master transcription factor associated with the function of Treg cells. 
 In inflammatory tissue microenvironments tied to autoimmune disease, loss of CD25 (the IL-2 receptor) is one of the first changes in Tregs to occur, leading to co-production of inflammatory cytokines and an overall weakened suppressive potential. LANCL2 activation provides protection from and restoration of IL-2 signaling by augmenting STAT5 phosphorylation. As a result, LANCL2 activation by BT-11 and other product candidates that target LANCL2 results in stable Tregs that have enhanced suppressive capacity as evidenced by expression of key regulatory molecules such as immune checkpoint inhibitors like PD1. The importance of LANCL2 in Tregs has been independently validated in a proteomics-based screen identifying differential expression of LANCL2 in Tregs compared to non-Treg cells. 
 The graphics below illustrate key elements of LANCL2 activation by BT-11. 
 
 
•BT-11 Multimodal MoA: •Decreases the production of inflammatory mediators tied to IBD (TNFα, IFNγ, MCP1, IL-6, and IL-8) •Increases anti-inflammatory molecules in Tregs that protect from autoimmunity (IL-10, FOXP3) •BT-11 generates suppressive regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) that restore and maintain immune tolerance in the Gl tract •Decrease proliferation and differentiation of effector CD4+ T cells (Th1 and Th17) •Aid in epithelial cell and support the reduction of IL-8 and chemokine-dependent neutrophil influx Leber, A., et al.

•Multipronged mechanism of action targeting downstream known immunological targets tied to autoimmune diseases, including IBD. •BT-11 enhances CD25/STAT5 signaling to support the stable differentiation of regulatory CD4+ T cells with greater anti-inflammatory functionality. •BT-11 increases PDH activity, resulting in increased oxidative metabolism supporting FOXP3 stability. •BT-11 downregulates glycolytic pathways associated with TNF-α production and effector CD4+ T cells, including production of lactate and over-expression of EN01. •BT-11 increases suppressive effects of Tregs due to enhanced immune checkpoint surface markers (LAG3 and PD-1).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While critical to functions in Tregs, the LANCL2 receptor is expressed in a wide range of immune cells, epithelial cells and cells from metabolic (muscle, adipose and liver) tissues. The effects within these cell types often mirror the described signaling events within Tregs, whereby the promotion of mitochondrial metabolism parallels potent anti-inflammatory markers. In IBD, mitochondrial metabolism pathways account for the majority of downregulated genes relative to healthy controls. A primary cause of this downregulation is a direct result of defective regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells. In both mouse models of IBD and intestinal epithelial organoids ex vivo, activation of mitochondrial function has been observed with LANCL2 activation, restoring this metabolism to healthy levels. When this restoration is achieved, chemokine production from intestinal epithelial cells is decreased, leading to suppression of neutrophil recruitment into the intestinal wall. In IBD, neutrophils are crucial histological markers of active disease as well as the primary source for calprotectin, a highly predictive fecal biomarker of response to treatment since the majority of drugs approved for treating IBD cause a drop in fecal calprotectin concentrations. Neutrophils and fecal calprotectin were significantly decreased by LANCL2 activation in all preclinical models tested and in our Phase 1 clinical trial, fecal calprotectin concentrations were also decreased following BT-11 treatment. In phagocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells), LANCL2 activation of mitochondrial metabolism supports the efficient processing of harmless cellular material from the body taken up by these cells leading to increased production of IL-10 from these cells and lower auto-reactivity to self-antigens. In metabolic tissues, LANCL2 activation results in increased AMPK signaling, which increases mitochondrial function and synergizes with insulin to activate efficient energy storage in both muscle and liver. 
 With robust control of both immune and metabolic signaling, we believe the novel LANCL2 pathway is relevant in a wide range of autoimmune, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, specifically CD, UC, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, NASH, type 1 diabetes and psoriasis. We have prioritized IBD as our first indication in the LANCL2 pathway due to the significant unmet clinical need and major therapeutic gaps in both UC and CD and the mechanistic relevance in both Tregs and epithelial cell metabolism. Validation of the LANCL2 pathway in IBD with BT-11 may have wide-reaching implications on the development of new treatments for other diseases. For example, increased Treg stability and IL-10 production from phagocytes may be critical in restoring self-tolerance in systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, shifting the balance between Treg and Th17 cells and reducing neutrophil recruitment are highly relevant to improvement of symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. Correcting the underlying deficiencies in insulin sensitivity and reducing chronic low-grade systemic inflammation has potential to improve NASH. Decreasing Th2 responses might provide a therapeutic benefit in EoE. Modulating T cell responses and TNF in the skin might provide a therapeutic benefit in psoriasis. We are initially focused on developing three product candidates that target the LANCL2 pathway: BT-11, BT-104 and BT-111.

BT-11, an oral LANCL2 agonist for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease 
 Overview 
 BT-11 is an oral, gut-restricted, small molecule that is the first product candidate to target LANCL2 which we are evaluating in clinical trials in both UC and CD. UC and CD are chronic autoimmune diseases with significant therapeutic gaps resulting from safety concerns and modest efficacy of current treatments. We believe that an oral, gut-restricted small molecule delivered once daily in a singular tablet could address the therapeutic gaps in the UC and CD treatment paradigms and have a significant impact on quality of life for IBD patients. BT-11 is a wholly-owned product candidate that has successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. We have completed the induction phase of a Phase 2 clinical trial of BT-11 for mild to moderate UC in the United States, Russia and Europe. Based on the data from this trial, we expect to commence a Phase 3 trial of BT-11 in mild to moderate UC patients in the United States, Russia, Asia, and Europe in the second half of 2021, subject to review of the complete Phase 2 data and FDA feedback, and we expect to discuss with the FDA the pathway for further development of BT-11 in UC patients. We expect to commence a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in patients with moderate to severe CD in the first half of 2021. We have successfully filed a new IND for a new orodispersable BT-11 formulation for EoE in March of 2021. 
 Background on UC and current treatments 
 UC is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation, irritation, and ulcers in the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Symptoms include abdominal pain, rectal pain and bleeding, bloody stools, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and malnutrition. Having UC puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer. Diagnosis typically occurs in early adulthood and the disease requires maintenance treatment for the remainder of the patient’s life. UC is estimated to affect over 900,000 patients in the United States and over 1 million patients throughout the rest of the world. The global therapeutics market for UC was $5.3 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a 2.5% compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2026. Of this global market, the United States market comprised over $4 billion in 2019. With 70% of addressable patients experiencing a second flare within one year and 30% of patients in remission failing to stay in remission for more than one year, there is an unmet medical need in UC for safer and more efficacious therapeutics.

Patients with UC are classified into mild-to-moderate, comprising 70-80% of patients, and moderate-to-severe, based on the level of symptoms experienced. Accordingly, the current therapeutic treatments for UC depend on the severity of the disease and are broadly divided into five classes: 
 Mild to moderate UC 
 The following treatments are typically used in the treatment of mild to moderate UC: 
  
• | Aminosalicylates or 5-ASA (mesalamine, sulfasalazine) are used as a first-line therapy in UC without a precise mechanism of action. Approximately 80% of patients qualifying as mild to moderate in severity receive mesalamine as a maintenance drug, but many require corticosteroids to address disease flares and eventually lose response progressing into immunosuppressants or biologics. Aminosalicylates are commonly preferred by physicians and patients for the treatment of IBD, due to high tolerability in most patients. Common side effects include headache, nausea, dyspepsia, flatulence and diarrhea. Rare but more serious side effects include pleuritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, cholestic hepatitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corticosteroids (budesonide, prednisone) are used as induction agents and are prescribed for short periods to address disease flares in both mild to moderate and moderate to severe patients. Corticosteroids are generally administered through an oral or rectal route of administration. Common side effects are mild to moderate in intensity and include UC, headache, nausea, mood changes and sleep changes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunosuppressants (methotrexate, thiopurines) are used to wean patients off steroid use and rarely as independent maintenance drugs in moderate to severe patients. Immunosuppressants are orally administered but are systemically distributed agents. Common side effects include a decrease in the number of white blood cells (leucopenia), headache, rash, nausea, and dyspepsia (indigestion), alopecia (hair loss), mild increase in levels of liver enzyme (aspartate aminotransferase), peritoneal abscesses, abnormally low levels of the protein albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Moderate to severe UC 
 The following treatments are typically used in the treatment of moderate to severe UC: 
  
• | Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-IL-12/IL-23, anti-integrin) are the primary maintenance therapy in moderate to severe UC and comprised 59% in 2016 of the UC therapeutic market. Biologics are injectable therapies and can be divided into two classes: those targeting cytokines, comprising 80% of the biologics market in UC, and those targeting cell trafficking, comprising the remaining 20%. Side effects include leucopenia, immunosuppression, cancer, infection and death.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib) are an induction and maintenance therapy for severe patients that do not respond to other therapies, including biologics. Similar to immunosuppressants, approved JAK inhibitors are oral agents that are systemically distributed. Common side effects of JAK inhibitors include headache and nasopharyngitis, immunosuppression, increased risk for infections, changes in serum lipid levels, mild neutropenia and anemia, and slight increase in the incidence of malignancies (lymphoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that current therapeutics for the treatment of both mild to moderate and moderate to severe UC have the following limitations that we believe BT-11, if approved, may address: 
  
• | Safety and tolerability concerns. The majority of approved therapeutics for maintenance of UC (biologics and JAK inhibitors) are systemically distributed, resulting in effects on the immune system outside of the gastrointestinal tract. These effects result in increased risks for cancers, infections, blood clots and death. Given the chronic nature of these indications, there is a need for a safer long-term option. Despite a lower severity of disease, many of the mechanisms of action for current drugs in mild-to-moderate space are also tied to known toxicities such as drops in white blood cell counts and increased risk for infection in the case of immunosuppressants, and bone loss, weight gain, lowered quality of life and cardiovascular complications in the case of extended corticosteroid use. Thus, it is difficult to develop drugs with better safety profiles without targeting innovative mechanisms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconvenient and costly route of administration. The main class of therapy in UC is biologics, which are injectable therapies administered through either intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Often, this requires a patient to visit a clinic or specialist care provider which disrupts daily life, increases health care costs and lacks convenience. Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), the recommended therapy for mild-to-moderate UC by the American Gastroenterological Association, requires 2.4 to 4.8 grams per day, amounting to two to six tablets daily when dosed orally. Depending on the response to oral dosing, rectal dosing of mesalamine is sometimes required.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited efficacy. Resulting from a lack of innovation that repeatedly aims at very narrow targets, current therapeutics in UC have continually faced a capped effect size, achieving no greater than 25% in remission rate. For biologics, in placebo-controlled pivotal studies, the 4-domain remission rate effect size for biologics ranged between approximately 10% and 25%. To illustrate, the Gemini 1 trial for Entyvio provided a remission rate of 16.9% and the Gemini 1 and 2 trials for Humira provided 18.5% and 16.5% remission rates, respectively. Additionally, among patients responsive to treatment with biologics, approximately 40% will lose response within three years due to immunogenicity, development of compensatory inflammatory signaling, or unknown causes. Marketed and late-stage drugs in JAK and sphingosine-1-phoshate, or S1P, classes have achieved similar rates in Phase 3 studies including tofacitinib (18.5% remission in the Octave I trial) and ozanimod (18.4% in a trial conducted by the True North Center). Studies of biomarker normalization in recent studies support these rates. For fecal calprotectin, various cut-off values have been used to predict clinical remission including 250 µg/g such as for ustekinumab (30.3% normalization rate, 8.5% placebo adjusted at week 8) and 150 µg/g such as for vedolizumab (29.3% normalization rate, 12.5% placebo adjusted at week six). Similarly in a real-world scenario, tofacitinib had a 29% normalization rate using a 250 µg/g cutoff. In a complex autoimmune disease with multiple aspects to its pathogenesis, targeting a singular inflammatory pathway may continue to be ineffective in providing extended remission to more than 25% of patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Therapeutic gap. Currently no FDA-approved drugs address the region of the treatment paradigm between the aminosalicylate (5-ASA) failures and biologics, where the majority of patients exist. Patients are faced with the option of staying on a sub-optimal therapy, to which they are losing response, or moving into a class of treatment with drastically higher safety risks. Despite early promise, the emergence of safety concerns for JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators have limited the non-biologic immunomodulators that are currently in development to a biologic-failure class of patients. There is an unmet need for a safer and effective drug that can bridge the treatment paradigm from 5-ASA to biologics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution for treatment of UC 
 We believe that BT-11, our lead oral UC product candidate, if approved, has the potential to treat patients prior to their progression into biologics and address the main limitations of current therapeutics based on the clinical and preclinical data to date. We believe BT-11, if approved, may offer the following advantages: 
  
• | Gut-restricted PK with low systemic exposure. In preclinical and clinical studies, a comparison between the gastrointestinal PK of BT-11 versus the systemic PK in five species (mice, rats, dogs, pigs and humans) indicated that 99% of orally administered BT-11 remains in the gut. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, we validated the translation of the gut-restricted PK in humans since gastrointestinal concentrations of BT-11 human participants were observed to be on average 6,000-fold higher in the colon than the maximum serum concentration, or Cmax, in blood. In these studies, we observed that BT-11 was highly stable in the gastrointestinal environment and reached the colon in high local concentrations that scale proportionally with oral dose.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tolerability. In its Phase 1 clinical trial, BT-11 had no differences in presentation of adverse events, or AEs, clinical chemistry, changes in white blood cell counts, electrocardiogram, or ECG, and other clinical measures at doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 7,500 mg). Chronic studies in rats for six months and in dogs for nine months have been completed with NOAEL greater than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg, a dose which is 70-fold higher than the highest dose tested in our Phase 2 clinical trials in UC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient, once a day oral dosing. We designed BT-11 for IBD to be a single, once-a-day oral tablet. In our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate UC, we are evaluating BT-11 at two doses (500 and 1,000 mg), each of which are contained in a single tablet.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preclinical and translational testing. We have evaluated BT-11 in five mouse models of colitis and a pig model of colitis, and have observed consistent reduction of inflammatory markers and improvement of histological scores across diverse methods of disease induction including genetic, immunological, bacterial and chemical. In side-by-side comparative preclinical testing, BT-11 greatly exceeded the efficacy of other therapeutics (anti-TNF, 5-ASA, tofacitinib) in reduction of disease activity index, leukocytic infiltration and fecal calprotectin in Mdr1a-/- model of colitis. We believe this robust dataset lends substantial support to the validity of LANCL2 as an innovative immunometabolic pathway, with the potential to be targeted via BT-11 without inherent toxicities and which has demonstrated potent therapeutic activity in a broad range of animal models of IBD.

• | Innovative immunometabolic target not tied to toxicities. We have designed BT-11 to activate a novel target, LANCL2, to induce immunometabolic effects that favor regulatory responses. In human primary cells and preclinical disease models, BT-11 activated oxidative phosphorylation and promoted FOXP3 stability to enhance the suppressive activity of Tregs and restore local tissue homeostasis and immune tolerance. In addition to potentially being a very powerful monotherapy, given the novel target and lack of toxicities, we believe there is also potential to use BT-11, if approved, as a complementary or combination UC therapy.

Phase 2 clinical trial of BT-11 in UC 
 Phase 2 clinical trial design
In August 2019, we initiated dosing in a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial of 195 patients with mild to moderate UC. The primary objective of this trial was to establish efficacy and safety of oral BT-11. The study’s primary endpoint measured clinical remission in mild to moderate UC patients at week 12 of BT-11 treatment initiation, as defined by a 3-component definition of rectal bleeding = 0, stool frequency = 0 or 1, and endoscopic subscore = 0 or 1. The Mayo score is the primary evaluation measure in UC clinical trials, serving as a composite score (0-12) of endoscopic appearance, stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician assessment. The graphic below shows the design of the Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 

A total of 195 patients with mild to moderate UC (total Mayo Score 4-10; Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥ 2) were targeted to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive BT-11 low-dose (500 mg), BT-11 high-dose (1,000 mg) or placebo. In total, 198 patients were randomized with each of the treatment arms comprised of 66 patients. The randomization was stratified by whether the patient has had prior exposure to biologic therapy for UC and whether the patient had corticosteroid use at baseline. The trial consisted of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week induction period, an 18-week maintenance period and a two-week post-treatment safety follow-up period. Patients that were in clinical response or remission at week 12 were eligible to continue into the maintenance period. Patients entering the maintenance period stayed in the same blinded group assignment given in the induction phase. 
 The trial included endoscopies at baseline, week 12 (end of induction) and week 30 (end of maintenance). Endoscopic scoring was centrally read. During each endoscopy, biopsies were collected for histology, PK and target engagement in addition to other mechanistic and translational evaluations. Blood and stool samples were collected throughout the trial (baseline, weeks two, six, 12, 18, 24 and 30) to assess biomarkers, including calprotectin levels in feces. Rectal bleeding and stool frequency sub-scores were recorded by patient diary. 
 Secondary endpoints include endoscopic remission rate at week 12 (as defined by a MES of 0 or 1), mucosal healing rate at 12 weeks (defined by an MES of 0 or 1 and a Geboes Histologic Index score of less than 3.1), mean change in fecal calprotectin from baseline over 12 weeks, concentration of BT-11 in feces over 12 weeks and number of participants with treatment-related AEs.

Phase 2 clinical trial topline results 
 At week 12, in the intent-to-treat population, BT-11 induced clinical remission in 31.8% of patients at 1,000 mg QD and 30.3% at 500 mg QD, compared to 22.7% at placebo. BT-11 had a well-tolerated safety profile with no meaningful difference in AEs relative to placebo during the induction period.

In the intent-to-treat population, we observed a positive trend in absolute clinical remission rates as defined by the 3-component modified Mayo Score, using a stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 following 12 weeks of oral treatment with BT-11 at 1,000 mg QD or 500 mg QD compared to placebo (31.8% and 30.3% versus 22.7%; p=0.340 and 0.235). The resulting placebo-adjusted clinical remission rates of 9.1% and 7.6% for the 1000 and 500 mg dose groups, respectively, and are consistent with standard of care treatments in both mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe UC. In a more moderate subset of patients (with Mayo score equal to or greater than 7 at baseline) the placebo-adjusted clinical remission rates were 11.5%; (p=0.153) and 8.7% (p=0.273) for the 1000 (n=47) and 500 mg (n=44) dose groups, respectively, as compared to placebo (n=50). Additionally, in a small subset of biologic experienced patients, positive placebo-adjusted remission trends were also observed (66% and 33% in the 1,000 (n=3) and 500 mg (n=3) cohorts, respectively, as compared to placebo (n=3, 0%)).

The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p-value,” which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities.

During endoscopy at baseline and week 12, biopsies were collected for histological assessment of the colon. Histological samples were scored by a blinded central reader by the Geboes score, which is a histological scoring system for UC. The cutoff for histological remission was set as a Geboes score less than 2B.1, which is indicative of a lack of erosion, ulceration or granulation of the tissue, no crypt destruction, an absence of neutrophils in the epithelium and no noticeable increase of neutrophils in the lamina propria. In subjects with increased chronic inflammatory infiltrate at baseline, histological remission occurred in 42.1% of patients treated with 500 mg BT-11 (Δ = 16.6; p = 0.069) and 38.5% of patients treated with 1,000 mg BT-11 (Δ = 13.0; p = 0.158). In all randomized subjects, histological remission occurred in 48.5% of patients treated with 500 mg BT-11 (Δ = 13.7; p = 0.112) and 43.9% of patients treated with 1,000 mg BT-11 (Δ = 9.1; p = 0.285). Additionally, in a small subset of biologic experienced patients, positive placebo-adjusted histological remission trends were also observed (33% in both the 1,000 mg (n=3) and 500 mg (n=3) cohorts, respectively, as compared to placebo (n=3, 0%)). 
 

Pharmacokinetic measurements confirmed that dose proportional increases of BT-11 were observed in stool samples across each dosing group. As illustrated below, oral dosing of BT-11 resulted in stable stool concentrations of approximately 1,600 µg/g at a 500 mg oral dose and 2,600 µg/g at a 1,000 mg oral dose over the 12-week induction period. Similar dose proportionality occurred in biopsy samples collected at week 12, resulting in 3.84 µg/g with the 500 mg oral dose and 5.91 µg/g with the 1,000 mg oral dose. Estimated maximal plasma concentrations were not different than those observed in normal healthy volunteers and displayed no dose proportionality, suggesting no evidence of greater systemic absorption with a compromised intestinal epithelial layer. No change in estimated maximal plasma concentrations occurred through the 12-week induction phase.

In the overall modified intent-to-treat population, which included all randomized patients in the trial, BT-11 treated patients were more likely to experience normalization of fecal calprotectin at each time point than patients receiving placebo, providing a response as early as two weeks post-treatment, as illustrated below. No significant differences in baseline fecal calprotectin were observed across groups (BT-11 high dose: 403 ± 382 g/g; BT-11 low dose: 462 ± 468 µg/g; placebo 543 ± 420 µ/g [mean ± SD]). 
 22


Fecal Calprotectin Normalization 
 

As illustrated below, in patients with elevated fecal calprotectin levels (≥ 250 µg/g) at baseline, normalization and mean change in fecal calprotectin was assessed. Normalization of fecal calprotectin levels, commonly cited to be one of the most predictive biomarkers of response to treatment in UC and CD, was detectable in a subset of patients (n=106) with abnormal baseline calprotectin levels (>250 ug/g), after 2 weeks of oral dosing in over 40% of patients treated with BT-11 (n=64), at either dose level, when compared to 21% of patients receiving placebo (n=42). More specifically, normalization of fecal calprotectin occurred in 43.8% (Δ = 22.4) of patients receiving BT-11 1,000 mg and 40.6% (D = 19.2) of patients receiving BT-11 500 mg after 2 weeks of treatment, compared to 21.4% of patients receiving placebo. On average, patients receiving BT-11 1,000 mg experienced a mean change of -270.0 µg/g (Δ = -160.6) and patients receiving BT-11 500 mg experienced a mean change of -254.9 µg/g (Δ = -145.5), in each case after two weeks of treatment, compared to patients receiving placebo, who experienced a mean change of -109.4 µg/g. No significant differences in baseline fecal calprotectin were observed across the treatment groups in the subgroup analysis (BT-11 high dose: 461 ± 397 µg/g; BT-11 low dose: 613 ± 471 µg/g; placebo 639 ± 422 µg/g [mean ± SD]). Notably, in patients with elevated fecal calprotectin at baseline, BT-11 induced a 13.1 placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate at week 12.

In biopsies sampled from the most afflicted area of the colon, BT-11 increased the proportion of CD25+ regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg) relative to baseline. BT-11 also provided a significant reduction in TNF+ myeloid cells relative to baseline when compared to placebo.
 

Among the analyzed populations by flow cytometry, an increase in IL10+ anti-inflammatory cells was correlated to induction of clinical remission in BT-11 treated groups. No association was observed in placebo, suggesting a BT-11 dependent effect. In BT-11 treated groups, macrophages (CD64+ CX3CR1+) were observed to be key producer of IL10. The increase in IL10-producing macrophages in response to BT-11 treatment was significantly (p = 0.0378) associated to lower disease activity scores. Interestingly, similar increases of IL10-producing macrophages were observed in mouse models of IBD in response to oral BT-11 treatment.
 

The AEs observed were similar across the three arms of the trial, with 30.3% of the placebo group, 27.3% of the 500 mg BT-11 group, and 30.3% of the 1,000 mg BT-11 group reporting one or more AEs. The most common AE observed was worsening of ulcerative colitis, reported in 9.6% of patients study-wide, with no meaningful differences between the two treatment groups and the placebo group. No other AE was reported in more than 5% of patients. In total, 37 AEs were judged to be possibly or probably related to BT-11, with 11 of these events in patients treated with the highest dose of BT-11 (1,000 mg). No meaningful difference was observed in the presentation of infections and infestations between patients receiving any dose of BT-11 and placebo, with no patient dosed with BT-11 presenting with lymphopenia. Four total SAEs were reported, all of which were judged to be unrelated to BT-11. Overall, no emergent safety or tolerability concerns were identified. 
 Phase 1 clinical trial of BT-11 by single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose in normal healthy participants 
 The safety and tolerability of BT-11 was assessed in a two-stage, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in healthy male and female volunteers. The single ascending dose stage consisted of five groups of eight healthy male and female participants per cohort, each receiving a single oral dose of BT-11 or placebo in a six-hour fasted state. The multiple ascending dose stage consisted of three cohorts of ten healthy male and female participants, each receiving an oral dose of BT-11 or placebo once daily for seven days. Doses were tested ranging from 500 mg to approximately 7,500 mg in the highest cohort of each stage. 
 24


Safety and tolerability were assessed through types and frequency of AEs, physical examination, ECGs, biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis. No trends in AE presentation were observed in comparison between BT-11 and placebo or between specific cohorts. No serious adverse events were reported. No AEs were identified to have a probable or definite relationship to the study drug. None of the clinical laboratory results, including serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis, outside the reference range were considered to be clinically significant in either the single ascending dose or multiple ascending dose stages. No changes from baseline in white blood cell count or percentages of specific immune cell subsets were observed in blood on day seven of the multiple ascending dose stage relative to placebo in any one cohort or across all participants who received BT-11. No changes in ECG parameters were assessed as clinically significant and no treatment-emergent AEs, or TEAEs, arose from abnormal ECG measurements.

 PK was assessed in blood, at multiple time points post-dosing, and in stool, on day seven in the multiple ascending dose stage. BT-11 concentrations were quantified within feces on day seven of the multiple ascending dose stage. Concentrations of 2.39 mg/g were observed in participants who received 500 mg of BT-11 daily for seven days. Stool BT-11 levels were observed to scale proportionally in a manner similar to the scaling of oral dosage. In contrast to stool concentrations, a plasma Cmax of 372 ng/mL at 1.19 hours post-dose was observed in participants receiving 500 mg daily for seven days, a value that is more than 6,000-fold lower than concentrations observed in feces. Plasma concentrations scaled at a less than dose proportional scale when comparing high-dose to low-dose, with only an 8.2-fold increase in AUC0-24 relative to a dosage increase of 14.3-fold. Plasma BT-11 was quickly cleared with half-life of 2.7 hours. In parallel with PK analysis, calprotectin concentrations were measured in feces. This study was not powered for detecting statistical differences in biomarkers. Mean fecal calprotectin was observed to be lower in the BT-11 500 mg cohort than those observed in placebo.

 Clinical development plan 
 Phase 3 clinical trial design of BT-11 in UC
We intend to initiate an integrated Phase 3 clinical program of BT-11 in patients with mild to moderate UC in the second half of 2021, subject to review of the complete Phase 2 data and subject to FDA feedback in June of 2021. The Phase 3 program is expected to be two independent induction trials feeding into a single maintenance trial. All aspects of these trials will be randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter designs. The purpose of these trials will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral BT-11 in the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. The trial will use a co-primary endpoint of clinical remission, as defined by a Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0, Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, at week 12 and week 52. Secondary endpoints will be included to assess mucosal healing by endoscopic and histologic evaluation, improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa, maintenance of corticosteroid-free remission, clinical response, fecal calprotectin and changes in individual Mayo subscores. 
 An estimated total of 632 patients with mild to moderate UC (total Mayo Score 4-10; Mayo endoscopic subscore MES ≥ 2) and a 6-point Mayo score (sum of rectal bleeding and stool frequency) equal or greater than 2 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive BT-11 low-dose (500 mg) or placebo into the first induction trial. The second induction trial will include 720 patients (randomized 1:1) with matching treatment groups and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The protocol for the second trial will hold the analysis of the maintenance endpoints. The final number of patients may be adjusted based on the final data package from our Phase 2 clinical trial. The randomization will be stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy for UC and corticosteroid use at baseline. We will implement a controlled stratification to ensure a minimum of 20% of the overall population and a maximum of 40% have previously received biologic therapy. The trial will consist of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week induction period, a 40-week maintenance period and a 2-week post-treatment safety follow-up period. A mandatory steroid taper will commence at week 12. 
 The trial will consist of endoscopies at baseline, week 12 (end of induction) and week 52 (end of maintenance). Endoscopic scoring will be conducted centrally. During each endoscopy, biopsies will be collected for histology, PK and target engagement in addition to other mechanistic and translational evaluations. Blood and stool samples will be collected throughout the study (baseline, weeks two, six, 12, 18, 24 and 30) to assess biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin. Rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores will be recorded by patient diary. 
 The graphic below depicts the expected design of the Phase 3 clinical trial.

Preclinical results 
 BT-11 has been studied in five mouse models and one pig model of IBD. These five mouse models encompass diverse methods of disease induction including chemical (DSS), cellular (adoptive transfer), genetic (Mdr1a-/-, IL10-/-) and bacterial (Citrobacter rodentium). Key findings from our preclinical studies are summarized in the tables below.

 In the DSS model, correlation between the colonic concentrations of BT-11 with key markers (fecal calprotectin, histologic score and TNF expression) of preclinical efficacy was tested at two doses levels (8 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg). In each marker, an inverse trend was observed with decreasing concentrations or scores with increasing BT-11 concentrations. Fecal calprotectin had the strongest correlation to BT-11 concentration of the parameters tested. Overall, a dose dependent decrease was observed in the colonic expression of TNFα, IL6, and MCP1.

Preclinical biomarker responses to oral BT-11 (8, 25 mg/kg) during DSS colitis (n = 10, * P ☐ 0.05). 
 In the Mdr1a-/- genetic model, BT-11 (oral, 8 mg/kg) was compared to anti-TNF (2 mg/kg, intravenous), 5-ASA (oral, 25 mg/kg), and tofacitinib (oral, 30 mg/kg). Treatments were administered for six weeks. Disease activity index, a composite measure on a scale of 0-4 of rectal inflammation, stool consistency, weight loss and overall physical condition, was monitored throughout the treatment period. BT-11 provided significantly greater response relative to vehicle and the three comparative therapies, based on a side-by-side comparison. After six weeks of treatment, colon sections were prepared for histology and graded for leukocytic infiltration. Stool was collected for measurement of calprotectin. In both measures, the scores of BT-11 were significantly lower than vehicle and the three comparative therapies, as shown in the graphs below.

 Early validation of the local GI PK was conducted in rodents. While informative, the gastrointestinal tract of rodents is significantly different from humans in transit time, gut microenvironment and overall gastrointestinal physiology. We took an additional step to validate the gut-restricted properties of BT-11 in pigs. Pigs have a nearly 1:1 human equivalent dosing ratio to humans. Twenty-four hours after dosing, colon tissue and colonic stool were collected and assayed for BT-11 content. We observed high, dose-dependent levels of BT-11 in both tissue and stool. The ratio of BT-11 between tissue and stool in pigs was observed to be 1:10. Peak concentrations of less than 150 ng/mL, 3,000-fold lower than tissue and 30,000-fold lower than stool concentrations, were observed in plasma one hour post-dosing. Minimal differences were observed between pigs with IBD and healthy pigs in absorption or local GI PK.

In addition to the PK studies, we also used the pig IBD model to measure BT-11 efficacy. We used a seven-day DSS challenge with four groups: placebo and BT-11 at 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg, given orally in tablets. Colonic tissue and stool samples were collected at the end of the seven-day study. By histology, the amount of inflammatory cells in the colon was significantly decreased at 100 mg and 200 mg of BT-11. Calprotectin was reduced by approximately half in all BT-11-treated groups. Regulatory CD4+ T Foxp3+ cells that help control inflammation were increased in the colonic wall of all three BT-11 treated groups. As minimal increased in efficacy measures were observed beyond 100 mg, the 500 mg and 1,000 mg dose levels were chosen for preliminary examination in clinical studies based on the pigs used in this study being approximately one-tenth the size of an average human. 
 

Reduction of leukocytic infiltration and fecal calprotectin with increase in colonic CD4+ FOXP3+ cells in pigs challenged with DSS for 7 days and treated with BT-11 tablets (50, 100, 200 mg) daily (n = 9, * P ≤ 0.05). 
 In initial translational studies, BT-11 was tested in vitro with lamina propria mononuclear cells, or LPMCs, isolated from colonic samples of UC donors. BT-11 significantly reduced TNFα+, IL-4+ and IFNγ+, at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 µM. BT-11 also significantly increased FOXP3+ LPMCs at these concentrations, suggesting that BT-11 remained effective in cells isolated from the afflicted target area. While numerous factors differ between in vivo and in vitro environments, these experiments also provide preliminary insight into the extracellular concentrations of BT-11 necessary to induce immunological changes in human cells. 
 LPMCs were obtained from colonic resections of UC patients. Cells were treated for 24 hours ex vivo with BT-11. Flow cytometry was used to identify TNF+, IL4+, FOXP3+ and IFNg+ CD45+ cells. Statistical significance by treatment group (n = 8) is shown in the tables below.

Preclinical GLP toxicology results 
 In non-clinical repeat dose GLP toxicity studies, BT-11 showed no signs of toxicity at all tested doses. These studies have included three-month studies in rats and dogs, six-month studies in rats and nine-month studies in dogs, providing the necessary non-clinical data to support long-term dosing in humans. In these pivotal toxicology studies in rats and dogs, the NOAEL was greater than 1,000 mg/kg. In targeted studies for cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system effects, a NOAEL ≥ 1,000 mg/kg was also observed with no effects on ECG parameters, heart rate, respiratory rate, or functional observational battery. No target organ systems have been identified pre-clinically. BT-11 has not been identified to have any dose-limiting toxicities in animals. 
 The genotoxicity of BT-11 has been tested in one in vivo test and two in vitro assays, one of which utilized human cells. The genotoxicity studies have been the standard Ames, chromosomal aberration and micronucleus tests. None of these tests suggested mutagenic potential up to tested limit doses. We plan to conduct carcinogenicity studies of BT-11 in parallel with our planned Phase 3 clinical trial in UC. 
 BT-11 had minimal inhibitory effects on CYP enzymes and common drug transporters. Combined with limited overall systemic exposure and a high plasma protein, BT-11 has shown low potential for negative drug-drug interactions in our preclinical studies. BT-11 has a long metabolic half-life, but a short systemic half-life of less than three hours in PK studies. Analysis of urine and feces from toxicology studies in rats and dogs indicate that BT-11 is excreted unmetabolized through both routes. 
 Background on Crohn’s disease and current treatments 
 CD is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation, irritation, and ulcers in any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, but most commonly affects the end of the small bowel and the beginning of the colon. It can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, and inflammation of the intestine can skip, or leave normal areas in between patches of diseased intestine. Symptoms include abdominal pain, increased abdominal sounds, rectal pain and bleeding, bloody stools, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and malnutrition. Having CD puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer. CD is estimated to affect over 700,000 patients in the United States. The global therapeutic market for CD was approximately $9.6 billion in 2016, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7% between 2016 and 2026. Of this global market, the United States market comprised approximately $7.8 billion in 2016. The main current treatments for CD depend on the severity of the disease and are divided into four classes: 
 Mild to moderate CD 
 Treatment for mild to moderate CD includes: 
  
• | Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) (mesalamine, sulfasalazine) can be prescribed to mild CD patients with colonic disease. Aminosalicylates are generally administered through an oral or rectal route of administration. Unlike UC, for which 5-ASA is commonly accepted as a first-line therapy, the efficacy of oral aminosalicylates in CD is controversial and has limited supporting evidence. Aminosalicylates are generally well-tolerated by patients in the treatment of IBD. Common side effects include headache, nausea, dyspepsia, flatulence and diarrhea. Rare but more serious side effects include pleuritis, pericarditis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, cholestic hepatitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction.

• | Corticosteroids (budesonide, prednisone, cortisone) are used as induction agents and are prescribed for short periods to address disease flares across the spectrum of severity in CD patients. Corticosteroids are administered through oral, intravenous and rectal routes of administration in the treatment of CD. Over one-third of CD patients are steroid-dependent defined as a relapse after dose reduction or within 30 days of stopping a steroid regimen. Common side effects are mild to moderate in intensity and include UC, headache, nausea, mood changes and sleep changes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunosuppressants (methotrexate, thiopurines) are used as independent maintenance therapy in CD and can be used in combination with biologics. Immunosuppressants can be orally administered or injected and are systemic agents. Because of the AE profile, use of immunosuppressants can require frequent monitoring. Common side effects include leucopenia (a decrease in the number of white blood cells), headache, rash, nausea, and dyspepsia (indigestion), alopecia (hair loss), aspartate aminotransferase (mild increase in levels of liver enzyme), peritoneal abscesses and hypoalbuminemia (abnormally low levels of the protein albumin in the blood).

Moderate to severe CD 
 Treatment for moderate to severe CD primarily consists of biologics. 
  
• | Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-IL-12/IL-23, anti-integrin) are the primary maintenance therapy in moderate to severe CD and comprised 59% in 2016 of the UC therapeutic market. Anti-TNF and anti-IL-12/IL-23 comprise 80% to 90% of the biologics used in CD. Anti-integrin biologics have a limited penetrance into the CD market. Biologics are injectable therapies. Biologics, particularly those targeting cytokines, have been associated with increased risks of cancer, infection and death.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that current therapeutic options have the following limitations: 
  
• | Safety concerns. The primary therapies in CD pose significant health risks. Anti-TNF and anti-IL-12/IL-23 biologics have been associated with higher risks for malignancies and infections. One of two anti-integrin therapies for CD has been associated with greater risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Immunosuppressants are associated with drop in white blood cell counts, liver damage and risk for infection. In addition to the common side effects of corticosteroid outlined above, extended corticosteroid use has been shown to contribute to bone loss, weight gain, lowered quality of life and cardiovascular complications. There are limited options available for patients and clinicians who prioritize safety and low risk for AEs when selecting therapies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited efficacy. Current therapeutics have limited efficacy, with 18% to 25% effect sizes in induction of remission. For instance, up to 20% of CD patients are resistant to steroid treatment and have limited options for induction therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of long-term maintenance options. In placebo-controlled pivotal clinical trials, the most successful biologics achieve an approximate 18% to 25% effect size in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index, or CDAI, based remission. Additionally, half of patients who receive biologics as maintenance therapy experience a relapse of disease within one year. Immunosuppressive therapies have a greater risk of side effects that typically result in attempts to withdraw the therapy. Approximately one-third of patients experience a relapse shortly after withdrawal. These frequent disease flares result in greater steroid use which has been associated with a higher risk for developing refractory disease and for need of surgical resection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconvenience. Current marketed biologics require injections, either through subcutaneous or intravenous routes, that can necessitate trips to clinics or care sites for administration, be disruptive to the lives of patients, and result in slight decreases in compliance. Current oral drugs for CD require high doses taken multiple times daily.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Therapeutic gaps. Gaps exist on both ends of the CD treatment paradigm. There is no consensus first-line therapy in CD. The main competition in biologic naïve patients are immunosuppressants. No current therapeutic effectively treats patients who are refractory to biologics. These patients require frequent steroids and surgery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution for treatment of CD 
 We believe that BT-11, if approved, has the potential to serve as a first-line CD therapy, offering treatment for patients prior to their progression into biologics by addressing the main limitations of current therapeutics. We believe that an oral, gut-restricted small molecule delivered once daily in a singular tablet could serve as a first-line therapy in the moderate to severe CD treatment paradigm. In clinical trials to date, BT-11 has been observed to have the following characteristics in the treatment of CD: 
  
• | Gut-restricted PK with low systemic exposure. GI concentrations of BT-11 are on average 6,000-fold higher in the colon than in blood. A gut-restricted PK profile may assist in limiting the number of observed systemic adverse side effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tolerability. Clinical studies (>7-fold) and preclinical studies (>100-fold) of BT-11 to date have not identified any dose-limiting toxicities well above the proposed therapeutic window. No systemic suppression of white blood cells, a common feature of biologics, immunosuppressant and other drugs in development, has been observed with BT-11.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient, oral, once a day dosing. We have designed BT-11 to be a single, once-a-day oral tablet. We are evaluating BT-11 in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CD at a 1,000 mg dose contained in a single tablet per day.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32


 
• | Preclinical and translational testing. BT-11 has been evaluated in five mouse models of IBD and a pig model of IBD providing consistent efficacy across diverse methods of disease induction including genetic, immunological, bacterial and chemical. Comparative efficacy studies in animal models indicate a doubling of response relative to anti-TNF. In human primary cells, BT-11 significantly downregulated TNF and IFNg at low concentrations. We believe that these preclinical results support advancement of BT-11 in the treatment of CD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovative target. BT-11 is the first therapeutic candidate to target and activate LANCL2, a novel target, to induce immunometabolic effects. With the high frequency of switching treatments observed in IBD due to lack or loss of response, we believe additional differentiated mechanisms of action are needed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1 clinical trial results 
 The Phase 1 clinical trial of BT-11 in normal healthy volunteers tested oral doses up to 7,500 mg for up to seven days. No treatment-related adverse event differences were noted between all BT-11 cohorts and placebo. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Phase 2 clinical trial design of BT-11 in Crohn’s disease 
 Following our receipt of topline results from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of BT-11 in UC, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral BT-11 in moderate to severe CD. The primary objective of this trial will be to establish the efficacy of oral BT-11 in inducing clinical remission at week 12 in patients with moderate to severe CD. The co-primary endpoints will be proportion of patients achieving clinical remission at week 12 defined by CDAI of less than 150 and proportion of patients with an endoscopic response at week 12 defined by 50% reduction from baseline in the simplified endoscopic index of severity for Crohn’s disease, or SES-CD, score. The graphic below depicts the planned design of the Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 

A total of 150 patients with moderate to severe, active CD will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio, in a centralized manner, to receive 1,000 mg of BT-11 or placebo. Moderate to severe, active CD will be defined as: 
  
a) | a CDAI score of 220 to 450;
---+----------------------------


b) | a patient-reported outcome (PRO-2) liquid/very soft stool frequency (SF) score ³ 4 and/or abdominal pain (AP) ³ 2, (seven-day average); and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | a SES-CD score ≥ 6 ( ≥ 4 for isolated ileitis) (confirmed by a central reader).
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33


 Each of the treatment arms will comprise 75 patients. The randomization will be stratified by prior exposure to biologic therapy for CD with exposed population limited to 50% and corticosteroid use at baseline. The trial will consist of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week induction period, an 18-week maintenance extension period and a 2-week post-treatment safety follow-up period. Patients that are in clinical response or remission at week 12 will be eligible to continue into the maintenance period. Patients entering the maintenance period will stay in the same blinded group assignment given in the induction phase. 
 Secondary endpoints will include clinical response, endoscopic remission, deep remission, mean change in CDAI and mucosal healing. Biopsies collected from endoscopies conducted at baseline, week 12 and week 30 will be used to evaluate histology, PK, target engagement and other mechanistic and translational outcomes. Blood and stool will be used to assess biomarkers throughout the study. 
 Preclinical results 
 Many of our preclinical models of BT-11 evaluated the product candidate in both CD and UC, as described above. The adoptive transfer and IL10-/- models both develop ileitis in addition to colitis and would be considered the most relevant out of the five models of CD. 
 In human lamina propria mononuclear cells isolated from the colon of CD patients, BT-11 significantly reduced TNFα+ and IFNγ+ cells at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 µM. BT-11 significantly increased IL10+ cells at the same concentrations and increases FOXP3+ cells at 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 µM. 
 

Reduction of TNF+ and IFNg+, and increase in FOXP3+ and IL10+ cells in LPMC of CD patients treated ex vivo with BT-11 (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 µM) (n = 6, P ≤ 0.05). The results are expressed as % within CD45+ (hematopoietic immune cells) obtained from the colon. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology results 
 Preclinically, pivotal repeat-dose studies in rats up to six months and dogs up to nine months have resulted in NOAEL ³ 1,000 mg/kg and no identified dose-limiting toxicities to date. 
 BT-11 for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis 
 Overview 
 BT-11 is an oral small molecule that is the first product candidate to target LANCL2 in the esophagus for EoE. In parallel to ongoing development in UC and CD, we are developing a modified formulation of BT-11 to treat EoE. EoE is categorized by inflammation of the esophagus due to an increased presence of eosinophils, a type of immune cell. The FDA has not approved any treatments of EoE. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for product candidates designed to treat EoE, indicating that the FDA considers EoE to be an orphan disease. We have successfully filed an IND for BT-11 for the treatment of EoE in March of 2021. 
 Background on EoE and current treatments 
 EoE results from a dysregulation of Th2-mediated immunity that drives recruitment of eosinophils to the esophagus. The inflamed esophagus can cause chronic pain, frequent hospitalization and emergency room visits, difficulty eating and swallowing, and formation of fibrotic strictures. With up to 160,000 patients in the United States, EoE is an orphan disease without a currently FDA-approved therapeutic. 
 Currently, management of EoE often consists of the use of proton pump inhibitors, corticosteroids or inhaled medications typically used for asthma. It is estimated that approximately one-third of EoE patients have no response to current medical practices in EoE. Therapeutics in development are primarily corticosteroids, including budesonide which is used for IBD and asthma, and biologics, including dupilumab, which targets the IL-4 receptor for the treatment of asthma and eczema. 
 34


Our expectation is corticosteroid use and biologics will have similar limitations to those observed in IBD, including a presence of side effects and loss of response over time. Given the prevalence of EoE within both pediatric and adult populations, there is an unmet need for therapeutics with limited risk for side effects. 
 Our solution for the treatment of EoE 
 EoE stems from an excessive Th2 response in the esophagus that is thought to result from increased stimulation by epithelial cells and dendritic cells. In combination, regulatory functions of eosinophils, mediated through FOXP3, are suppressed in EoE patients. As such, there are multiple means to intercept the pathogenesis of disease. 
 Mechanistically, LANCL2 activation has the potential to impact the maintenance of the epithelial barrier, prevention of Th2 responses and improvement of suppressive capacity. We believe data generated from the evaluation of BT-11 efficacy in preclinical models of IBD and translational patient samples support that BT-11 may be used for the treatment of EoE. In mice, BT-11 was observed to decrease Th2 cells in the colonic mucosa, a mechanism important for both UC and EoE. In human LPMCs, BT-11 decreased the percentage of IL-4+ CD4+ T cells. IL-4 is one of the main cytokines produced by Th2 cells to recruit eosinophils. 
 As described previously, we believe that BT-11, if approved, has the potential to offer a differentiated profile to corticosteroids and biologics centering on tolerability, limited systemic exposure, oral dosing, and an innovative mechanism of action to restore tolerance. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 Oral BT-11 is supported by a robust GLP toxicology package potentially enabling chronic dosing through six-month rat and nine-month dog studies up to 1,000 mg/kg. No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed in safety pharmacology studies and no mutagenic potential has been suggested by genotoxicity studies. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We have successfully filed an IND for BT-11 and received FDA clearance for the treatment of EoE in March of 2021. This EoE trial will assess a modified formulation of BT-11-provided drug release in the oral cavity and esophagus. The primary objective of the trial will be to assess biomarkers of type 2 immune responses, analyze changes in esophageal eosinophil count and determine effects on the dysphagia symptom questionnaire, the primary patient-reported outcome measure in EoE. A secondary objective will be to assess PK of the modified formulation of BT-11 in humans. 
 BT-11 for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis 
 Overview 
 BT-11 is a topical small molecule that is the first product candidate to target LANCL2 in the skin for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. In parallel to ongoing development in intestinal disorders, we are developing a topical formulation of BT-11 for the treatment of skin inflammation. Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are both disorders of the skin that cause itchiness, rashes, red patches, thickened skin and the formation of plaques or scales. We intend to submit an IND for BT-11 for the treatment of psoriasis in the second half of 2021. 
 Background on psoriasis and atopic dermatitis and current treatments 
 Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are commonly linked to factors associated with both keratinocytes and immune cells resulting in inflammation of the skin with the formation of rashes and persistent itch. Psoriasis commonly manifests as plaque psoriasis in which the skin thickens and takes on a scaly appearance due to over-proliferation of skin cells. This over-proliferation results from an increase activation and reactivity of Th17 cells. Similarly, in atopic dermatitis, over-active Th17 cells strongly contribute to the proliferation of skin cells. The activation of Th2-related responses are also often tied to the immunological changes during active disease in atopic dermatitis. Psoriasis was estimated to afflict 14.9 million patients, resulting in a global market of $12.2 billion in 2017 and projected to be about $19.2 billion by 2027. Atopic dermatitis was estimated to afflict 81.6 million patients, with over a three-fold greater prevalence in children and adolescents, resulting in a global market of $6.4 billion in 2017. 
 35


Currently, management of psoriasis often consists of the use of topical corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. For more severe cases or those presenting with psoriatic arthritis, use of systemic immunosuppressants (methotrexate, cyclosporine) or a biologic targeting TNF or the IL-12/-23 pathway. In Phase 3 trials, ustekinumab had a 63.1% placebo adjusted response rate and adalimumab had a 64% placebo adjusted response rate, wherein the response was a 75% reduction in the psoriasis area and severity index. Atopic dermatitis has a similar treatment paradigm with the use of topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors as first-line drugs, followed by use of systemic immunosuppressants (methotrexate, cyclosporine) and biologics (dupilumab) targeting the IL-4 receptor. In pivotal trials, dupilumab had a 28% placebo-adjusted response rate, wherein the response was a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator’s Global Assessment and a reduction of 2 points or more in that score from baseline. 
 Similar to their usage in other autoimmune disease, biologics and immunosuppressants require monitoring of liver functions and immunosuppression, as use of these agents has been linked to increased risks of infections and cancers. 
 Our solution for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis 
 We believe topical BT-11, if approved, could function as an alternative front-line therapy to reduce the usage of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. In addition to no dose limiting toxicities identified in completed nonclinical and clinical trials, we believe that BT-11 through its Treg-associated mechanism of action could offer a greater likelihood of maintained responses relative to other topical therapies. We believe further applications of topical BT-11 as an adjunctive therapy to systemic treatments in refractory cases could be possible. 
 In an imiquimod-induced mouse model of psoriasis, BT-11 significantly decreased the presence of TNF+, IL-17+, IL-6+, and IL-21+ cells in the spleen when administered directly to the skin daily. Importantly, TNF and IL-17 are critical elements of the pathogenesis of disease in both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. 
 

Immune cell changes induced by topical BT-11 in an imiquimod-induced model of psoriasis after one week of treatment (n = 9, * P☐0.05). 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 Oral BT-11 is supported by a robust GLP toxicology package potentially enabling chronic dosing through six-month rat and nine-month dog studies up to 1,000 mg/kg. No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed in safety pharmacology studies and no mutagenic potential has been suggested by genotoxicity studies. The oral and general toxicity package will be supported by in vitro and in vivo skin corrosion and irritation assays. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We intend to submit an IND for BT-11 for the treatment of psoriasis in the second half of 2021, and to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in psoriasis in the second half of 2021. This trial will assess a topical formulation of BT-11 to be applied directly to the skin. The primary objective of the trial will be to assess cytokine biomarkers of immune responses, analyze changes in epidermal thickness and determine effects on the psoriasis area and severity index score, the common primary outcome measure in psoriasis. A secondary objective will be to assess PK of the topical formulation of BT-11 in humans.

BT-104 for the treatment of lupus 
 Overview 
 BT-104 is an orally-active, systemically bioavailable small molecule therapeutic candidate that targets LANCL2 that we are developing for the treatment of SLE. The pathogenesis of SLE is connected to defective apoptosis leading to stimulation of B cells by dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells to produce auto-antibodies. These antibodies activate the complement system and deposit in organs leading to inflammation and tissue damage. We believe the activation of LANCL2 can intercept these events upstream through skewing of CD4+ T cells to regulatory phenotypes and maintenance of the metabolic requirements for autophagy. SLE remains a poorly-managed disease with safety concerns, limited efficacy and lack of diversity in current treatment options. We believe that an oral molecule with a differentiated mechanism of action could address the limitations of current therapies. We intend to submit an IND for BT-104 for the treatment of SLE in the second half of 2021. 
 Background on SLE and current treatments 
 SLE involves a complex cascade of events that results in auto-antibody generation and immune complex formation. The deposition of these complexes manifests local inflammation in the tissues most commonly associated with lupus, kidney, cardiovascular system and skin, leading to damage and diminished function over time. SLE is an expanding public health threat that affects over 1.5 million patients in the United States and 5 million people worldwide, according to the Lupus Foundation of America. Direct health care costs amount to $18 billion per year in the United States and up to $12 billion in lost productivity as a result of the disease. Sales of the top 10 therapeutics for lupus amount to over $4 billion annually. 
 Nearly 60% of SLE patients experience more than one flare per year or present with persistently active disease. Mortality rates and progression to end stage renal disease, or ESRD, have plateaued in recent years with currently available treatment options, indicating an unmet clinical need for safer and more effective therapeutics. SLE is commonly treated with corticosteroids, with 87% of patients being placed on a steroid-based regimen. Other therapeutic options fall into four classes: 
  
• | Antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine) have been used in the treatment of SLE due to an ability to lower the IFNγ response. Up to 70% of SLE patients are estimated to be on antimalarials. Due in part to approval in 1956 for SLE, robust knowledge on the efficacy of antimalarials in SLE through placebo-controlled clinical trials is limited in regards to currently relevant endpoints.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biologics (belimumab, rituximab) used in the treatment of SLE primarily target B cells. Belimumab is the only new FDA-approved treatment for SLE in the past 60 years and inhibits BAFF to block B cell maturation. In Phase 3 testing, the high dose of belimumab had an effect size less than 10% relative to placebo in the primary endpoint of SLE responder index response rate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), methotrexate) are often used in the treatment of SLE and function by broadly blocking the proliferation of B and T cells. While used in a large portion of patients with lupus in combination with other therapies, the main clinical trials for immunosuppressants in lupus have failed to demonstrate effects in approvable endpoints by the FDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NSAIDs are used to manage fever, arthritis and headaches coupled with SLE. Due to an association with renal side effects, the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of SLE is closely monitored. Cutaneous reactions and hepatotoxicity are also observed with higher frequency in SLE patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SLE remains a poorly managed disease with a lack of diversity in therapeutic options. Aside from limited efficacy, current medications are required to be taken multiple times daily in high doses and complex combinations. Limitations of current therapeutics include: 
  
• | Safety concerns. The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of SLE is associated with numerous side effects including cataracts, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular damage. With common doses of steroids ranging from 7.5 to 100 mg, it has been noted that a 1 mg/day increase in steroid exposure results in a 2.8% increase in risk for new organ damage in SLE. In clinical trials of belimumab, more death was observed in the treated groups relative to placebo, including due to septic shock, pneumonia and suicide. Antimalarials and immunosuppressants both increase risk of cardiovascular complications and infections.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37


 
• | Disease progression. In as little as 10 years post-diagnosis, SLE patients accrue neuropsychiatric, renal, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal damage that cause chronic pain in two-thirds of patients. This damage accrual leads to lower quality of life and increased health care burden. Development of lupus nephritis occurs in 50% to 70% of patients and ESRD, necessitating kidney transplants, occurs in 15% to 30% of patients due to poor disease management with current therapeutics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of new therapeutic options. Only one new drug for SLE has been approved in the last 60 years, with many clinicians instead choosing the off-label use of sub-optimal drugs. Current mechanisms of action target broad immunosuppression, interferon production, activation of B cells or the production of antibodies. With all current therapies targeting similar pathways, it is likely that subpopulations of SLE are continually non-responsive even with switches in medication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution for treatment of SLE 
 The common investigational therapeutic targets in SLE are B cells and plasma cells, interferon responses and production of antibodies, which ignore the cascade of upstream events that lead to their activation. LANCL2 has the potential to intercept the complex cascade of upstream events that result in auto antibody generation and immune complex formation at two levels. First, as previously described in the context of BT-11, LANCL2 is an important receptor in regulatory CD4+ T cells and is differentially expressed by over 7-fold in Tregs relative to non-Treg CD4+ T cells. Activation of LANCL2 boosts oxidative phosphorylation and synergizes with IL-2/CD25 signaling to support and enhance FOXP3 stability and the suppressive function of Tregs. In human SLE and the NZB/W mouse model of lupus, CD25+ FOXP3+ CD127low Tregs are decreased in number and exist with a less suppressive phenotype. IL-2 levels are also suppressed in SLE, leading to CD25- Tregs that fail to enact regulatory functions. Preclinically in animal models, neutralization of CD25 has led to accelerated disease while the adoptive transfer of Tregs slows disease onset. 
 Second, LANCL2 supports the process of autophagy, the process that allows cells to eliminate defective cell material. In SLE, impaired autophagy results in the incomplete processing of apoptotic cells and accumulation of nuclear antigen that immune cells begin to react to over time. In SLE, impairment of LC3-associated phagocytosis proteins, such as Atg7 and Rubicon, results in lesser lysosomal fusion and the production of inflammatory cytokines during a process that typically produces IL-10. In the absence of LANCL2, macrophages and dendritic cells increase phagocytic uptake of cells but have lower expression of many autophagy-related genes. Critically, autophagy is a highly energy-intensive process, requiring mitochondrial metabolism to break down the material. The activation of LANCL2 can facilitate the generation of mitochondrial energy and enhance the production of IL-10 in phagocytes. 
 We believe that BT-104, if approved, may address the limitations of current therapeutics in the treatment of SLE based on the following characteristics below. 
  
• | Enhanced tolerability. There have been no dose-limiting toxicities to date in clinical development of BT-11. As a regulatory receptor, its activation does not result in the suppression of white blood cells or greater susceptibility to infection or malignancies. Preliminary dose-range finding studies with BT-104, at doses of 125 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, has resulted in no adverse effects in rats at up to seven days of dosing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Halt of disease progression. No currently available therapy aims to restore homeostasis or address the continued presentation of nuclear antigens. Therefore, compensatory mechanisms may develop over time, resulting in loss of efficacy. The activation of LANCL2 may aid in reversing the original break in immune tolerance. Preclinically, LANCL2 activation has been observed in mice to prevent the worsening of proteinuria with interventional dosing of BT-104. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiated mechanism of action. Current therapeutics for the treatment of SLE are all immunosuppressive in their mechanism of action, making LANCL2 clearly differentiated. LANCL2 induces regulatory CD4+ T cells and ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in immune cells. While differentiated, LANCL2 has reduced the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies and expression of IFNγ, in mouse models and human primary cells. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical results 
 In a NZB/W F1 mouse model of lupus, BT-104 reduced serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and prevented worsening of proteinuria grade from baseline. Mice were treated with BT-104 daily for 12 weeks between the ages of 24 and 36 weeks. Ninety percent of mice treated with BT-104 experienced an improvement or no change in proteinuria grade from baseline, in comparison to 90% of vehicle treated controls that experienced a worsening in grade. Grade 2 or lower proteinuria is well correlated with the prevention of ESRD clinically. 
 

Reduction of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and prevention of proteinuria worsening after oral treatment of NZB/W F1 with BT-104 (20 mg/kg) for 12 weeks between the ages of 24 and 36 weeks (n = 10, P ☐ 0.05). 
 Oral BT-104 treatment has resulted in immunological changes systemically. In the spleen, 20 mg/kg of BT-104 increased CD25+ FOXP3+ Tregs and decreased IL21+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells assist in B cell maturation and amplify humoral responses. 
 

Oral treatment of NZB/W F1 mice with BT-104 (20 mg/kg) for 12 weeks, between the ages of 24 and 36 weeks, increased the percentage of CD4+ Treg cells and suppressed T follicular helper cells in the spleen (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05). 
 The efficacy of LANCL2 activation was evaluated in cells obtained from blood (PBMCs) of SLE patients with active disease. BT-104 was observed to have a dose-dependent response, with maximum efficacy observed between 100 nM and 200 nM when PBMCs were treated with agents that activate inflammation, namely PMA + ionomycin (general activation), TLR7 (gardiquimod) and ODN2395 (type C CpG). BT-104 prevented IFNγ secretion in human primary cells stimulated with potent IFNγ inducers.

 Preclinical GLP toxicology results 
 Preliminary dose-range finding studies have been conducted with oral BT-104 at doses of 125 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg in rats over seven days. These studies revealed a NOAEL ³ 500 mg/kg with no changes in hematology, biochemistry, organ weights, macroscopic or microscopic lesions. PK studies of BT-104 in rats show a bioavailability greater than 70% within the therapeutic dose range of 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. 
 In preparation for IND submission, BT-104 will be assessed in 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs at doses of 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg and 1,000 mg/kg. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We intend to submit an IND for BT-104 for the treatment of SLE in the second half of 2021 and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers in 2022. This study will feature a standard single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose design (five cohorts of single ascending dose and three cohorts of multiple ascending dose) testing a dose range 5-fold to 10-fold greater than the projected clinical therapeutic dose. The primary objective of the study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of BT-104 by frequency and severity of AEs, standard safety laboratory results, ECG and vital signs. A secondary objective will be to assess the PK of BT-104 in humans. 
 BT-104 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
 Overview 
 BT-104 is a systemically bioavailable small molecule product candidate that targets LANCL2 that we are developing for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is linked to dysfunction of CD4+ T cells leading to over-activation of cells within the joint synovium. LANCL2 is an anti-inflammatory receptor that controls CD4+ T cell subsets towards regulatory phenotypes. The activation of LANCL2 results in a net decrease of inflammatory cell infiltration. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease with therapeutic gaps resulting from safety concerns and limited efficacy of current treatment options. We believe that an oral molecule with a differentiated mechanism of action could address the limitations of current therapies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We intend to submit an IND for BT-104 the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of 2021. 
 Background on rheumatoid arthritis and current treatments 
 Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that results in chronic pain and loss of mobility in joints due to excessive inflammation that swells the joints and erodes bone and cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis affects 1.3 million patients in the United States and has a global market estimated to be approximately $25 billion annually. With age as a risk factor, the number of new cases of arthritis is expected to increase as the elderly population expands. The therapeutic market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of over 4% from 2018 to 2025. 
 Rheumatoid arthritis requires chronic treatment to maintain remission and treatment escalation or add-ons to address flares. Approximately 10% of patients will be in remission for a full year. Current treatments for rheumatoid arthritis are categorized into five classes: 
  
• | NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) are used in mild cases of rheumatoid arthritis to provide slight anti-inflammatory effects in addition to pain and symptom relief. Safety risks for NSAIDs are minor in comparison to other classes of drugs but possess limited efficacy in moderate to severe cases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corticosteroids (prednisone) are used to broadly suppress inflammation in the presence of a flare. Corticosteroid use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is associated with weight gain, muscle loss, decrease in bone density and cardiovascular issues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 40


 
• | Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a broad class of drugs including methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biologics (anti-TNF, anti-CD20, anti-IL6R, fusion protein) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are diverse with targets of cytokine signaling, B cell depletion, and Th17 differentiation. Biologics can result in increased risk of cancers and infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib) function by blocking the signals that promote activation of CD4+ T cells and other immune cells. The side effects of JAK inhibitors are numerous, including drop in white blood cell counts, anemia, blood clotting and death.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations of current therapies in rheumatoid arthritis are tied to safety and efficacy. There is a high risk of severe side effects with all current treatments, aside from NSAIDs. Medical practice lacks an option for moderate to severe patients that does not present with significant risk of co-morbidities. Given “black box” safety warnings on both biologics and JAK inhibitors, we believe new therapies that are safer and equally effective would have a clear market advantage. About 40% to 50% of rheumatoid arthritis patients experience a 50% drop in severity when switching to a new therapy with 30% to 35% entering remission. The high non-response rates and loss of response rates in rheumatoid arthritis continues to offer ample market opportunity for novel mechanisms of action. 
 Our solution for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
 We believe BT-104, if approved, may offer a competitive advantage relative to current therapies given its novel mechanism of action and the lack of dose-limiting toxicities we have observed to date preclinically. LANCL2 is a key receptor in the plasticity between Treg and Th17 cells and accumulation of Th17 cells in the synovium is a shared characteristic of most individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, which drive the production of TNF and the recruitment of neutrophils and fibroblast like synoviocytes. Interactions between these three cells types are central to joint swelling, pannus formation and osteoclast differentiation. 
 Due to an ability to inhibit de novo Th17 differentiation and to prevent adoption of effector phenotype in Tregs, the activation of LANCL2 shifts the balance of this plasticity towards Tregs. Clinically, in the context of BT-104, LANCL2 activation has reduced calprotectin levels, a marker of neutrophil infiltration comprised of S100A8 and S100A9 subunits that are greatly increased in rheumatoid arthritis. Preclinically, LANCL2 activation significantly decreases calprotectin levels relative to tofacitinib, a marketed therapy for arthritis, in a separate model of autoimmune disease. These combined immunological changes can decrease ICAM1 and CD109 overexpression that leads to excessive fibroblast like synoviocyte infiltration. 
 In preliminary clinical development and preclinical studies, LANCL2 activation posed significantly less risk for toxicities than biologics, JAK inhibitors and other DMARDs. LANCL2 activation is novel in comparison to other treatments in rheumatoid arthritis by initiating an immunometabolic signaling cascade to enhance regulatory and tolerogenic pathways. This could offer an additional treatment option to the high refractory and relapsing population in rheumatoid arthritis. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology results 
 BT-104 has been tested in a seven-day dose range finding study in rats up to doses of 500 mg/kg with no adverse effects observed. We expect to initiate GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs in the first half of 2021. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Subject to receiving authorization to proceed under an IND, we expect to initiate a safety and tolerability Phase 1 study in normal healthy volunteers of BT-104 in 2022. 
 BT-111 for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
 Overview 
 BT-111 is a small molecule product candidate that targets LANCL2 that we are developing for the treatment of NASH. NASH results from activation and proliferation of fibroblasts in response to chronic inflammation caused by obesity, lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. LANCL2 activation may ameliorate autoimmune disease and has shown benefit in restoring insulin sensitivity in obesity. We intend to submit an IND for BT-111 in the second half of 2021. 
 41


Background on NASH and current treatments 
 NASH affects over 8 million patients in the United States and greater than 16 million patients globally. With current NASH-related health care costs exceeding $15 billion in the United States, NASH represents a large public health problem. With expected yearly growth of nearly 45%, NASH may become one of the most pressing health concerns worldwide. NASH increases risk for liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiac death. 
 There is no currently FDA-approved treatment for NASH. As such, the projected annual market opportunity by 2025 is estimated to be up to $30 billion. Current treatment options for NASH are diet and exercise, which have poor patient adherence in both the short- and long-term. Further, these approaches are more effective in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, whereas reversal of the fibrosis occurring in NASH may require pharmacological intervention. 
 A primary challenge in the development of NASH therapeutics has been the identification and selection of quantitative clinical trial endpoints and lack of information on representative disease-related biomarkers to use in early-stage clinical trials. Current therapeutics under development have effect sizes ranging between 8% and 15% relative to placebo fibrosis improvement with no worsening of NASH, suggesting sufficient room for improvement. We believe the ideal NASH therapeutic would be an oral medication capable of inducing immunological and metabolic effects. 
 Our solution for the treatment of NASH 
 NASH is a reversible fibrotic disorder of the liver resulting from chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are major risk factors causing lipid accumulation and local macrophage activation that stimulates myofibroblasts to overproduce collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. LANCL2, in addition to immune cells, is expressed within hepatocytes and muscle cells. In the context of type 2 diabetes, the natural ligand of LANCL2 improves glycemic control, increases glycogen metabolism and lessens adipose tissue inflammation. 
 Within the liver, the loss of LANCL2 increases liver size, triglyceride content and fibrosis. Mechanistically, LANCL2 activation increases expression of Pgc1a in metabolic tissues resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis and synergizes with insulin to activate glycogen synthase enzymes. Combined, these effects can reverse metabolic dysfunction and restore lipid homeostasis. The potential efficacy of LANCL2 in NASH is additionally supported by the anti-inflammatory effects, including downregulation of TNF and IL-6, that can reduce the proliferation and activation of myofibroblasts in the liver. 
 There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of NASH. We believe BT-111, if approved, has the potential to address the unmet clinical need in NASH by providing: 
  
• | Well-tolerated with convenient dosing. The activation of LANCL2 has not been associated with any dose-limiting toxicities in preclinical or clinical development in NASH or other indications. LANCL2 activation does not block lymphocyte trafficking or proliferation directly, making it unlikely to be associated with drops in white blood cell count or increased risk for bacterial or viral infections. BT-111 would be administered as a once-daily oral tablet that is generally accepted to result in high patient compliance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dual impact on immunity and metabolism. The anti-inflammatory actions of LANCL2 are well established, with an ability to decrease TNF expression and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells in multiple disease models. Within adipose tissue, LANCL2 decreases the presence of TNF producing macrophages. The activation of LANCL2 also increases glucose uptake and utilization in muscle and maintains insulin sensitivity. BT-111 may therefore address the inflammation-associated fibrosis and the underlying metabolic dysfunction in NASH. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical results 
 Therapeutic dosing of BT-111 (10 mg/kg) for six weeks between weeks six and 12 of CDAA diet, reduced lipid accumulation and liver fibrosis (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05). Liver fibrosis, assessed by percent positive area in liver histology by Masson’s trichrome staining, was approximately normalized to standard diet controls.

 In the same model and treatment paradigm, BT-111 reduced markers of inflammation, including Th17 cells and TNF-producing myeloid cells (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05). Both IL-17 and TNF have been linked to the progression of NAFLD to NASH due to their ability to induce hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation, even in the presence of low TGF-ß. 
 

Reduction of Th17 and CD11b+ TNF+ cells after oral treatment of BT-111 (10 mg/kg) for 6 weeks in a 12 week CDAA-diet model of NASH (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05). 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 We plan to test BT-111 in a seven-day dose range finding study in rats up to doses of 1,000 mg/kg in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect to conduct PK studies testing the bioavailability and profile of BT-111 in rats in the therapeutic window (1-20 mg/kg) in the second half of 2020. We intend to initiate GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs in the second quarter of 2021. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Following an expected IND submission in the second half of 2021, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 study in normal healthy volunteers in 2022. This study will feature a standard single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose design testing a dose range 5-fold to 10-fold greater than projected therapeutic dose. The primary objective of the study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of BT-111 by frequency and severity of AEs, standard safety laboratory results, ECG and vital signs. A secondary objective will be to assess the PK of BT-111 in humans and metabolic biomarkers including cytokine and lipid profiles. 
 BT-111 for the treatment of type 1 diabetes 
 Overview 
 BT-111 is a small molecule product candidate that targets LANCL2 that we are developing for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed, requiring life-long insulin replacement therapy. No treatment exists to maintain or restore beta cell mass. LANCL2 is a receptor that induces anti-inflammatory and regulatory effects that may help to restore self-tolerance and that promotes glycemic control. We intend to submit an IND for BT-111 in the second half of 2021. 
 43


Background on type 1 diabetes and current treatments 
 Type 1 diabetes is a devastating autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of cells within the pancreas that produce insulin leading to elevated blood sugar and damage to other organs. Type 1 diabetes afflicts about 1.5 million patients in the United States and 3.3 million globally. Its incidence is estimated to increase by 3.9% annually worldwide between 2016 and 2026. Direct medical expenses related to the management of type 1 diabetes, including insulin, syringes, pumps and monitoring supplies, and annual lost income totaled $16 billion in the most recent estimate according to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Total type 1 diabetes-related health care costs commonly exceed $100,000 per patient over his or her lifetime. 
 The current treatment of type 1 diabetes is management with insulin therapy. Use of combination therapies to improve glycemic control are rare. No treatment is currently available to prevent or delay progression of beta cell loss upon diagnosis. Due to the difficulty of managing glycemia and complications from the disease, the average patient lifespan is reduced by over 17 years. The limitations of standalone insulin therapy are: 
  
• | Variability. Highly individualized glycemic responses to meals, responsiveness to the type of insulin and variation in physical activity confound proper control over blood glucose management. Current approaches place a high responsibility on the patient to accurately estimate insulin need. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Failure to address all ß cell functions. Insulin therapy does not address additional missing functions of ß cells, such as the production of C-peptide or amylin, the auto-reactivity of the immune system, or the complications that arise. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term complications. The current recommended HbA1c goal for type 1 diabetes patients is 7.0. However, the average HbA1c is 8.4 in type 1 diabetes. This deviation from the target range has severe long-term consequences and confirms the need for additional glycemic control measures to combine with insulin therapy. Prolonged dysregulated blood glucose can lead to obesity and insulin resistance with age, worsening management and contributing to the deterioration of health. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution for the treatment of type 1 diabetes 
 At diagnosis, type 1 diabetes patients typically still have between 20% and 40% of their original ß cell mass and function. Following the beginning of insulin therapy, endogenous insulin production is observed to be increased in a 12-month window post-diagnosis, suggesting the ability to regenerate or maintain pancreatic function. The combination of ß cell loss remission and the need for precipitating events suggest that the immunological destruction of pancreatic islets is capable of being stalled or even reversed. 
 We believe the activation of LANCL2 has a potential 3-fold benefit in type 1 diabetes through promotion of anti-inflammatory responses, maintenance of beta cell health and support of glycemic control. LANCL2 down-regulates the production of TNF, IFNy and IL-21, the main cytokines associated with islet destruction. In type 1 diabetes, ß cells undergo Bax and caspase 3 induced cell death. LANCL2 activation increases calcium signaling and reduces mitochondrial stress, reducing the activation and expression of Bax and caspase 3. LANCL2 assists in glucose uptake in muscle and other metabolic tissues, promoting translocation of GLUT4 and glycogen synthetase activity, which can aid in glucose homeostasis in situations of low insulin production. 
 Plasma concentration of the natural LANCL2 ligand, ABA, is decreased in diabetes, removing an endogenous compound that contributes to insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. ABA can be produced in the central nervous system and pancreas, among other locations. Metabolic benefits of the LANCL2 signaling axis are observed in hepatocytes, adipocytes and myocytes through uptake and oxidation of glucose to improve the systemic glucose homeostasis. LANCL2 activation may alleviate pancreatic stress in early disease and assist with glucose control in late disease. We believe BT-111 may be used in type 1 diabetes to: 
  
• | Provide anti-inflammatory effects. Increased number of IL-10-producing cells during the short window post-diagnosis is associated with better blood glucose control. Similarly, type 1 diabetes patients with lower IFNγ production were more likely to exhibit an extended post-diagnosis remission in ß cell loss. LANCL2 activation has been shown to increase the ratio of IL-10 CD4+ T cells to IFNγ CD4+ T cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preserve ß cell functions. BT-111 maintains ß cell mass in a NOD mouse model and reduces apoptosis of human islet cells in response to oxidative and inflammatory stress in vitro. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 44


 
• | Normalize post-prandial spikes in blood glucose. Type 1 diabetes patients experience prolonged elevations in blood glucose after meals and overall non-physiological trends. The activation of LANCL2 may assist in insulin-independent glucose uptake and energy storage that would provide greater control of blood glucose regulation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 We intend to initiate GLP IND-enabling studies for BT-111 in 2021. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We intend to initiate a safety and tolerability study of BT-111 in normal healthy volunteers in 2022. 
 Our NLRX1 pathway product candidates 
 The NLRX1 pathway 
 The NLRX1 pathway addresses the immunometabolic interface from a different angle than the LANCL2 pathway. As a mitochondrial associated receptor, NLRX1 is favorably positioned to induce both metabolic and immunological effects. NLRX1 is unique among its family of receptors as one of three out of 23 NLRs to primarily induce regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The most commonly studied NLRs are those associated with the inflammasome, a complex whose activation results in high levels of cytokine production and cell death that increases inflammation. An overactive inflammasome and polymorphisms in inflammasome associated NLRs, such as NLRP1 and NLRP3, are commonly identified in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. NLRX1 is the natural counterbalance to this process, serving to control and negatively regulate many of the processes induced by inflammasome activation. NLRX1 serves as a key regulatory molecule permitting oxidative metabolism without the generation of inflammatory responses to the resultant by-products. Through effects on c-Abl and Nrf2, NLRX1 activates expression of enzymes to increase intracellular antioxidant capacity. The downregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and lactate production decreases NF-κB activity, a main signaling element upstream of many inflammatory cytokines. As a result, NLRX1 activation decreases a wide range of cytokines, including ones of CD4+ T cell origin as well as ones of myeloid origin. 
 
 
•NX-13 multi-modal mechanism of action by activating the NLRX1 pathway •Decrease cellular reactive oxygen species •Antagonism of NF-κB activation resulting in downregulation of myeloid cell and T cell derived cytokines like TNF and IFNγ •Decreased inflammasome formation (NLRP1 and NLRP3) •Decreased differentiation of effector CD4+ T cells. •NLRX1 activation in intestinal epithelial cells increases mitochondrial metabolism and prevent oxidative stress. •Favors cell survival, the maintenance of barrier integrity and the expression of tight junction proteins.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
At the cellular level, NLRX1 activation results in shifts in the balance in CD4+ T cell subsets, decreased activation of macrophages and decreased stress-induced cell death for epithelial and other specialized cells. The decrease in lactate production and NF-κB activity results in proportionally higher Treg cells relative to Th17 cells with NLRX1 activation. Similarly, NF-κB is a main molecule that signals the polarization of macrophages into inflammatory subsets as opposed to those associated with tissue repair and homeostasis. In macrophages, NLRX1-associated ubiquitination of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is thought to contribute to decreased activation. In intestinal epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells and neurons, NLRX1 activation increases mitochondrial metabolism and prevents oxidative stress. These effects are beneficial to functions of these cell types, including cell survival, the maintenance of barrier integrity and expression of tight junction proteins. In addition, the added metabolic support decreases the likelihood that a cell will exacerbate inflammation during cell death. By favoring apoptosis, a relatively silent form of cell death, NLRX1 can aid in the tissue homeostasis and repair process to prevent chronic tissue damage and fibrosis. 
 45


Our development pipeline of NLRX1-targeting product candidates has a preliminary focus on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases most closely associated with altered inflammasome activation. We are currently developing three product candidates targeting the NLRX1 pathway: NX-13, NX-66 and NX-73. Further, we believe the development of NLRX1 ligands for IBD, CNS disorders, including MS, and respiratory disorders including asthma is supported by specific preclinical and translational target validation. 
 NX-13, an oral NLRX1 agonist for the treatment of UC and CD 
 Overview 
 NX-13 is an orally active small molecule product candidate that targets NLRX1, a negative regulatory NOD-like receptor. NX-13 is the first product candidate to target NLRX1. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for NX-13 in normal healthy volunteers. 
 Our solution for treatment of UC 
 Due to the involvement of microbial and dietary factors in the onset and progression of UC, many pattern-recognition receptors, which are part of the environmental surveillance system by detecting bacterial and food components, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. Unlike many of its family members, NLRX1 has neither well-characterized and prominent genetic mutations nor inflammatory effects. Out of 23 human NLRs, three are categorized as regulatory NLRs, of which NLRX1 is one. While NLRX1 interacts with many of the same downstream signaling elements as other NLRs, NLRX1 serves to control and mitigate these responses rather than activate them. This includes control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NF-κB signaling, leading to a downstream decrease in TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-g production and a lessening of mucosal inflammation. Mechanistically, the activation of NLRX1 could have a 3-fold benefit in UC with the ability to modulate epithelial integrity, host-microbiome interactions, and mucosal immune responses. As such, we believe NX-13 could provide significant benefits compared to current therapeutics for UC. 
 46


NX-13 is designed to target NLRX1 and provide therapeutic efficacy by inducing anti-inflammatory effects in CD4+ T cells and other immune cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. NLRX1 was identified as an immunometabolic therapeutic target based on loss of function characterization in animal models of IBD in which the loss of NLRX1 increased disease severity and histological lesions, altered CD4+ T cell differentiation, disrupted epithelial barrier integrity, and influenced gut microbial populations. Through the immunometabolic actions of NLRX1 leading to increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased NF-κB activity in CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, NX-13 inhibits the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 subsets and overall immune activation. NX-13 is a gut-restricted compound with minimal systemic absorption observed in preliminary pharmacokinetic studies in rats. This allows for oral activity in the gastrointestinal tract. 
 

As a once-daily, oral, gut-restricted molecule, we believe NX-13 has a promising target product profile for the treatment of UC. Early nonclinical and clinical studies of NX-13 have not revealed any dose-limiting toxicities. In preclinical comparative efficacy studies to 5-ASA, anti-TNF, and tofacitinib, we have observed significantly greater changes in disease activity, biomarkers and histological parameters with NX-13. We believe that through NLRX1 activation, NX-13, if approved, may offer the potential for an independent or complementary approach to address the limited efficacy observed in UC with current options. 
 Phase 1a clinical trial of NX-13 by single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose in normal healthy participants 
 In July 2020, we initiated dosing in a Phase 1a clinical trial of NX-13 in normal healthy volunteers. This trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single and multiple ascending dose trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of oral NX-13. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of single and seven-day repeat oral doses of NX-13. Safety and tolerability endpoints included changes from baseline in biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and ECG parameters, vital signs and frequency and severity of AEs. The secondary objective of the study was to assess the PK of NX-13 following administration of single and seven-day repeat oral doses. Plasma PK was obtained to assess systemic exposure. Stool concentrations of NX-13 were measured for local PK to inform doses carried forward into future UC patient studies. The graphic below depicts the design of the Phase 1 clinical trial. 
 47




The single ascending dose arm consisted of 35 healthy volunteers in a total of five cohorts (250 to 4,000 mg). Each cohort enrolled seven participants with five participants randomized to receive NX-13 and two participants randomized to receive placebo. The multiple ascending dose arm consisted of 21 healthy volunteers enrolled in a total of three cohorts (1,000 to 4,000 mg). Each cohort had seven participants with five participants randomized to receive NX-13 and two participants randomized to receive placebo. NX-13 was administered by oral tablet. 
 Across the eight cohorts, no SAEs were reported. No trends in laboratory tests were identified, including analysis of hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis parameters, at any tested dose. No meaningful changes in body weight, vital signs or ECG parameters were observed. The maximum tolerated dose was identified to be 10-fold greater than anticipated therapeutic dose. 
 Pharmacokinetic analysis identified that GI concentrations were more than 2,500-fold greater than peak plasma concentrations. As illustrated below, plasma NX-13 was observed to have a high distribution half-life with greater than an 80% reduction in peak plasma concentrations in three to four hours after dosing. After multiple dosing, no accumulation was observed and no change in trough concentrations were observed over the seven-day period. In plasma, peak concentrations were more than 2-fold less than dose proportional. In contrast, stool concentrations of NX-13 were observed to be dose proportional, as illustrated below.

In addition to pharmacokinetics, stool samples were used to quantify fecal calprotectin levels, as illustrated below. Across all groups, 56% of subjects dosed with NX-13 were brought to or below the detection limit of the assay. In both mean concentrations and change from baseline, a dose response to NX-13 was observed.

Clinical development plan 
 In the first half of 2021, we plan to initiate a Phase 1b trial of NX-13 in active UC patients. The objective of the study will be to identify changes in endoscopic score, fecal calprotectin and patient reported outcomes after treatment with one of multiple dose levels of NX-13. The results of the Phase 1b trial will be used to appropriately power a Phase 2 trial, which we expect to initiate in 2022. 
 

Preclinical results 
 NX-13 was evaluated in three mouse models of IBD to represent chemical, cellular and genetic methods of disease induction. NX-13 was administered orally at doses of 20 mg/kg in DSS and Mdr1a-/- and 10 mg/kg in adoptive transfer. Disease activity index, colonic leukocytic infiltration, lamina propria neutrophils and colonic TNF expression were used as endpoints.

 In the Mdr1a-/- model, concentrations of 24 cytokines were tested after six weeks of treatment with NX-13 at 10 or 20 mg/kg and compared to vehicle, NX-13 untreated, mice. Numerous inflammatory cytokines were observed to be significantly reduced including those tied to CD4+ T cell responses (IFNg, IL-17, TNFα, IL-4) as well as ones of myeloid origin (IL-6, IL-1ß, TNFα, MIP1α, MCP1).

 The efficacy of NX-13 (10 mg/kg, oral) was compared to anti-TNF (2 mg/kg, iv), 5-ASA (oral, 25 mg/kg), and tofacitinib (oral, 30 mg/kg) in DSS and Mdr1a-/- mice. NX-13 treatment resulted in an 86% reduction in fecal calprotectin, a 64% reduction in Th1 cells, and a 64% reduction in leukocytic infiltration. The reductions observed with NX-13 were 1.5-fold to 2.5-fold greater than those observed with anti-TNF and tofacitinib.

 We have tested the ability of NX-13 to reach the distal colon in high quantities after oral dosing in mice, rats and pigs. In pigs, which have a highly similar gastrointestinal tract to humans and an approximate 1:1 equivalent dosing ratio, NX-13 was observed at a concentration of over 6,000 ng/mg in colonic stool at 24 hours after oral dosing with 100 mg tablets. In our preclinical studies, one-seventieth of the colonic content NX-13 penetrated through the epithelial barrier. Dose-dependent concentrations are observed in both stool and tissue. 
 

Colonic content (stool) and colonic tissue concentrations of NX-13 24 hours after oral dosing of pigs with immediate release tablets (10, 50, 100 mg) (n = 4). 
 The efficacy of NX-13 in pigs with DSS colitis was evaluated to colonic concentrations of NX-13 with efficacy markers. Oral NX-13 tablets protected against weight gain deficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The 100 mg dose of NX-13 resulted in a 74% reduction in leukocytic infiltration, a 54% reduction in fecal calprotectin and an 80% reduction in TNF expression relative to placebo. We also observed significant reductions in all three parameters at a 50 mg dose. Leukocytic infiltration and TNF expression were significantly reduced at a 10 mg dose. When compared to the local GI PK concentrations of NX-13, colonic concentrations greater than 45 ng/mg appear sufficient to induce response in all parameters. Additional magnitude of response can be achieved with concentrations greater than 85 ng/mg. 
 

Reduction of weight gain deficiency, leukocytic infiltration, fecal calprotectin, and colonic TNF expression in pigs challenged with DSS for 7 days and treated with oral NX- 
 13 tablets (10, 50, 100 mg) daily (n = 6, P ≤ 0.05). 
 In PBMCs from moderate to severe UC patients (n = 6), NX-13 significantly reduces TNFα+ cells down with a 0.01 µM dose and IFNg+ cells down with a 0.05 µM dose. 
 

Reduction of TNF+ and IFNγ+ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from UC patients with ex vivo treatment of NX-13 (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 µM) after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin for 6 hours (n = 6, P ≤0.05).

Preclinical GLP toxicology results 
 NX-13 has completed IND-enabling studies and cleared 2 INDs plus initiated Phase 1 testing. 
 In rats, we evaluated doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day in a 28-day GLP repeat-dose toxicity study. The NOAEL of NX-13 in rats was 1,000 mg/kg with no treatment-related AEs or clinical observations at any of the tested dose levels. No mortality or noteworthy findings were recorded. No differences in food consumption, ophthalmology, gross pathology, hematology, serum chemistry or histopathology were observed at the 1,000 mg/kg dose level compared to the control, and this dose level was the NOAEL. 
 In the 28-day repeat dose GLP toxicity study in dogs at 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, no treatment-related ocular abnormalities, cardiovascular effects, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, gross or microscopic findings were seen in either sex during the week 4 examinations and necropsy. No clinical signs were considered evidence of systemic toxicity. The NOAEL of NX-13 in dogs was 500 mg/kg. 
 Oral NX-13 displayed no signs of disruption of organ system function in in vivo evaluation of respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous system function in GLP safety pharmacology studies up to tested limit doses. NX-13 did not show mutagenic potential in Ames, chromosomal aberration or micronucleus tests up to non-precipitating dose levels in vitro and 2,000 mg/kg in vivo. 
 Our solution for treatment of CD 
 NX-13 is an oral small molecule therapeutic targeting the NLRX1 pathway, a novel mechanism of action. The activation of NLRX1 is effective at inducing responses in CD4+ T cells, intestinal epithelial cells and myeloid cells. These responses are designed to result in a downregulation of multiple CD-associated cytokines (TNF, IL-1ß, Th1 cytokines), improved tolerance to the microbiome and reduced levels of oxidative stress. We believe NX-13, if approved, may address the unmet need for additional therapies in the treatment of CD based on the following observed characteristics: 
  
• | Well-tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities identified to-date.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oral, once-daily tablet.
--+-------------------------


• | Greater preclinical efficacy than current therapeutics with robust validation in multiple models.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the robust immunological changes induced by NLRX1 activation, NX-13 may also improve fibrosis, a key therapeutic gap in CD. Central to the fibrosis onset is the elevation of reactive oxygen species, which increases TGF-ß signaling, increases myofibroblast proliferation and induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. NX-13 reduces ROS through an induction of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase. The loss of NLRX1 has been shown to reduce markers of autophagy, including LC3-II and ATG16L1, in models of IBD. A SNP ATG16L1, well-correlated to an increased risk of CD, results in an active protein that is more susceptible to mitochondrial stress-induced degradation. Therefore, increased NLRX1 activity, which decreases mitochondrial and oxidative stress, could increase autophagy in CD by enabling stabilization of ATG16L1. Through this autophagy mechanism, NLRX1 further supports intestinal redox balance to promote tissue repair over fibrosis. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We have completed a Phase 1a clinical trial of NX-13 in normal healthy volunteers. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial evaluating NX-13 in CD in the second half of 2022. 
 Preclinical results 
 Many of the preclinical models of CD are shared with that of UC. Data on three mouse models and a pig model of IBD are presented above. The adoptive transfer model develops ileitis in addition to colitis and would be considered to be the most relevant of the three models to CD. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology results 
 Preclinically, pivotal repeat-dose studies in rats up to tested dose limits (1,000 mg/kg) for 28 days and dogs up to tested dose limits (500 mg/kg) for 28 days have resulted in no identified dose-limiting toxicities to date.

NX-66 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
 Overview 
 NX-66 is an oral, small molecule agonist of the NLRX1 pathway that we are developing for the treatment of MS. NLRX1 is a non-inflammasome-forming mitochondrial-associated NLR, expressed by immune cells systemically and in the CNS, that down-regulates inflammation in injury and autoimmune diseases, including models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE, colitis, and brain injury. Progressive MS presents with cortical lesions comprised of activated microglia and an overall increase in microglia in the brain. These microglia, as well as IL-12- and TNF-producing dendritic cells, contribute to direct neuronal damage as well as the ongoing demyelination that disrupts axonal architecture. In active EAE (direct immunization), passive EAE (adoptive transfer), and spontaneous EAE (2D2 mice), the loss of NLRX1 results in worsening of disease, greater microglial activation, and increased prevalence of spinal cord lesions. We intend to submit an IND for NX-66 in 2022. 
 Background on multiple sclerosis and current treatments 
 Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is frequently characterized by episodes of neurological disturbances followed with residual deficits or full recovery (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis) and in a minority by a slow accumulation of disability from the onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis). 
 Multiple sclerosis affects over 700,000 patients in the United States and over 2 million people worldwide. Multiple sclerosis results in decreased quality of life, with cognitive deficiencies reported in over 70% of patients and 42% of patients requiring informal caregiving from their families, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The global market for multiple sclerosis is currently over $20 billion per year and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2.8% per year through 2022. 
 Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is a fragmented market with all classes of therapies clustered around the similar efficacy profiles with 20% to 37% no evidence of disease activity rates, and patients with average age over 40 experience on average 25% or less inhibition of disability progression. In contrast, very few treatment options for progressive multiple sclerosis exist. The most recent approval for progressive multiple sclerosis, ocrelizumab, reported less than a 7% effect size relative to placebo in Phase 3 studies. Current therapeutics for MS are clustered into six main classes: 
  
• | Interferon betas were the first class of disease modifying therapeutics in multiple sclerosis and are believed to function through reduction of antigen presentation and CD4+ T cell proliferation. Clinical trials of interferon beta have shown no evidence of disease activity rate of approximately 20% of treated patients and have inhibited disability progression by 5% to 40%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biologics (alemtuzumab, natalizumab, ocrelizumab) for multiple sclerosis function through diverse mechanisms of action and are generally used in individuals who did not respond to other treatments. Mechanisms include lymphocyte maturation, lymphocyte trafficking and B cell depletion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immuno-modulators (DMF, teriflunomide) comprise a large portion of the multiple sclerosis market, including DMF, which had the highest sales among multiple sclerosis therapeutics in the United States in 2019. The two main drug within this class, DMF and teriflunomide, are weakly immunometabolic by mechanism of action. DMF increases Nrf2 while teriflunomide reduces T cell proliferation by targeting a mitochondrial enzyme.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Glatiramer acetate is a synthetic analogue of a main antigen in multiple sclerosis that functions through an inhibition of myelin-reactive T cells. While Copaxone, a glatiramer acetate, was the market-leading multiple sclerosis therapy in 2016, as of 2019 it sits outside of the top five brands for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with an approximate 7% market share.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anti-trafficking agents (fingolimod) are among the newest therapies in multiple sclerosis and generally target S1P receptors to block the migration of lymphocytes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) are commonly administered in multiple sclerosis intravenously in high doses over the period of three to five days in response to a disease flare. Efficacy in shortening disease flare is generally recognized.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 53


Limitations of these disease-modifying therapies include: 
  
• | Safety concerns. The profile of adverse effects of current therapeutics in multiple sclerosis is similar to those experienced in other autoimmune indications. Biologics used for multiple sclerosis increased the risk of infections and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Steroids and immuno-modulators result in liver toxicities and suppressed white and red blood cell counts. Anti-trafficking agents have been associated with cardiovascular complications and macular edema. With therapeutics that require chronic use, significant room for improvement is present in regards to safety. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited efficacy and loss of response. Across clinical trials of current therapeutics in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the rate of no evidence of disease activity has been observed to be 20% to 37% and patients with average age over 40 have experienced on average 25% or less inhibition of disability progression. The most recent approval for progressive multiple sclerosis was ocrelizumab, which offers less than a 7% effect size relative to placebo in 12-week disability progression. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disability progression. Current therapeutics range from 10% to 45% of inhibition of disability progression. As the majority of therapeutics are focused entirely on changing the immune response, limited effects on the underlying pathways of neurodegeneration are addressed. Progressive forms of MS have an altered immunological profile relative to relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis, with innate immune responses predominating. Most multiple sclerosis therapeutics target the adaptive immune system to suppress flares. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corticosteroid dependence. High-dose corticosteroids have short-term benefit in the resolution of disease flares. Chronic dependence on high-dose corticosteroids, even in pulses has been associated with cognitive deficiencies, depression, and remyelination and repair. Use in multiple sclerosis may be detrimental to long-term health. In neurological injuries and animal models of EAE, high-dose corticosteroids were associated with exacerbation of neuronal damage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
 We believe the NX-66, through a differentiated NLRX1 pathway, if approved, may offer a competitive advantage relative to current therapies given its potential to address neurodegeneration and disease progression. NLRX1 is one of three regulatory NOD-like receptors (NLRs), in an overall family of 23 NLRs. Genetic abnormalities in NLR genes are linked to MS pathology, such as the Q705K polymorphism resulting in an overactive NLRP3 inflammasome and multiple mutations in NLRP1. NLRX1 is uniquely positioned as the natural counterbalance to these inflammatory NLRs that are overactive in multiple sclerosis. Preclinically, there is abundant evidence for the potency of NLRX1 in EAE through loss of function studies. In active (MOG immunization), passive (adoptive transfer) and spontaneous (2D2) models of EAE, the loss of NLRX1 leads to greater disease activity scores, increased number and severity of spinal cord lesions, and greater microglia activation. Additionally, NLRX1 contributes to the prevention of neurodegeneration through promoting controlled apoptosis over necrosis and pyroptosis, and regulating oxidative stress. Thus, we believe NLRX1 may aid in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and address the therapeutic in multiple sclerosis based on the following observed characteristics: 
  
• | Tolerability. Preclinically, NLRX1 activation has not resulted in any dose-limiting toxicities in the study of NX-13 or NX-66. Mechanistically, NX-66 profiles most similarly to DMF out of current therapeutics. Importantly, DMF is often the choice of therapy when lack of side effects is a main point of concern by clinicians and patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficacy and loss of response. NLRX1 bridges innate and adaptive immune pathways, unlike other therapeutics. Progressive forms of MS have a notably different immune profile in the CNS, with an increased importance for microglia over CD4+ T cells in comparison to relapsing-remitting forms. NLRX1 is able to modulate both arms with effects directly on CD4+ T cells, through a down-regulation of Th1 and Th17 phenotypes, and microglia, through a promotion of repair pathways. We believe the ability to modulate both aspects of the disease course in multiple sclerosis may alleviate damage accrual. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disability progression. We believe NLRX1 has the potential to directly prevent neuronal damage through control of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons, as well as promote apoptosis over necrosis. Disability progression results from an inability to remyelinate neurons and an imbalance in neuronal maintenance toward cell death. Limited therapies exist to address neuronal stress outside of immunomodulation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 54


 
• | Corticosteroid dependence. Providing an orally-active therapeutic for multiple sclerosis with limited side effects may enable greater patient adherence, earlier treatment with potent therapy, and an alternative mechanism for non-responders to current therapies. Combined, we believe these three items could decrease the use of corticosteroids. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical results 
 Therapeutic dosing of oral NX-66 (20 mg/kg), between days 14 and 23 post-challenge, ameliorated disease severity in a MOG-induced model of EAE. NX-66 provided a greater than 50% reduction in disease activity four days after the initiation of treatment (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05). NX-66 treatment decreased Tnf and IL1b expression in the spinal cords of EAE mice. 
 

Disease activity index in a MOG35-55 induced EAE model. Treatment with NX-66 (20 mg/kg, oral) was initiated at day 14 post-challenge and continued until day 23. TNF and IL-1b expression in the spinal cords of mice on day 23 (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05). 
 NX-66 exerts neuroprotective effects in N2A cells. In an MTT assay of viability, NX-66 treatment prevents loss of viability and cell damage in response to rotenone, an inducer of reactive oxygen species, and TNF. 
 

Prevention of cell death in N2A cells stimulated with rotenone (100 µM) or TNF (100 ng/mL) by NX-66 (50, 100, 200 nM). Asterisks mark significance relative to vehicle (n = 9, P ≤ 0.05). 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 NX-66 will be tested in a seven-day dose range-finding study in rats up to doses of 1,000 mg/kg in the second half of 2021. PK studies testing the bioavailability and profile of NX-66 in rats in the therapeutic window (1-20 mg/kg) will be conducted in the first half of 2021. GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs will be initiated in the second half of 2021. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Following an expected submission of an IND in 2022, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers thereafter in the second half of 2022. This study will feature a standard single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose design testing a dose range 5-fold to 10-fold greater than projected therapeutic dose. The primary objective of the study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of NX-66 by frequency and severity of AEs, standard safety laboratory results, ECG and vital signs. The secondary objective will be to assess the PK of NX-66 in humans within blood and the CSF.

NX-66 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease 
 Overview 
 We are also developing NX-66, a small molecule product candidate targeting the NLRX1 pathway, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. NLRX1 activation can protect neurons from oxidative stress and ameliorate CNS inflammation. We believe NX-66 may represent a novel approach to addressing an unmet clinical need in Alzheimer’s disease, for which no current therapy slows the progression of cognitive decline and neurological damage. The primary driver of NX-66’s development in Alzheimer’s disease is this unmet need, promising preclinical data and mechanistic alignment with the immunometabolic dysfunction present in disease. We intend to submit an IND for NX-66 in 2022. 
 Background on Alzheimer’s disease and current treatments 
 Alzheimer’s disease is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disorder beginning with mild cognitive impairment and slight memory loss progressing into difficulty with everyday tasks and further into requirement of 24-hour care. Alzheimer’s disease affects up to 7 million patients in the United States with an estimated half million new cases diagnosed each year. With an expanding elderly population, the global therapeutics market for Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to be $12.9 billion by 2028 and is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 19.3% between 2018 and 2028. With decreased quality of life and high home and hospice care costs, the total health care cost related to Alzheimer’s disease is estimated to be over $300 billion. 
 No current treatment for Alzheimer’s disease has been proven to slow the damage of neurons that is associated with cognitive decline. Four drugs are currently approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease: 
  
• | Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that targets amelioration of cholinergic deficiency. Galantamine can be isolated as a natural product and is generally used in the treatment of mild to moderate cases with reported effects on slight improvements in cognitive function and memory.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor with primary mechanism of action tied to reversing the cholinergic deficiency present in Alzheimer’s disease. Donepezil provides a slight improvement in cognitive function without an effect on progression of disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rivastigmine is an additional cholinesterase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. As with other members of this drug class, its efficacy in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is primarily tied to symptomatic relief.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Memantine is a NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks excessive stimulation of neurons. Clinical trials of memantine resulted in no behavioral or neurological improvement, but a significant functional improvement, particularly in Severe Impairment Battery. Memantine and donepezil are also approved for use in combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All four approved drugs provide symptomatic relief by targeting neurological signaling. Recent failures in clinical development in Alzheimer’s disease have largely focused on the plaques and tangles associated with disease. Mechanistically, limited late-stage clinical development of anti-inflammatory therapies has been conducted. Microglial activation has been linked to amyloid and tau pathologies and can contribute to neuronal cell death. Inflammation is also highly linked to metabolism with dysregulation of lipids and glucose resulting from chronic activation. Defects in cholesterol biosynthetic pathways are main genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. The brain during Alzheimer’s disease experiences many of the same deficiencies in glycemic control present in type 1 diabetes. The combined inflammatory, metabolic and oxidative stress results in a poor environment for restoring cognitive function. 
 Our solution for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease 
 We believe NX-66, through a differentiated NLRX1 pathway, if approved, may offer a competitive advantage relative to current therapies given its immunometabolic pathway and potential to address neurodegeneration and disease progression. The immunopathology of Alzheimer’s disease shares common elements with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, including overactivation of the inflammasome and the central nature of immunometabolism in the interaction between neurons and immune cells. The inflammasome contributes to the overproduction of IL-1ß and other inflammatory cytokines in response to the amyloids and fatty acids that accumulate in the central nervous system with age. Meanwhile, loss of NLRP3 protects against dementia in the APP/PS1 model and other models of Alzheimer’s disease. Aside from proteins directly linked to amyloid deposition, APP and PSEN1, many of the recently identified genetic variants associated with Alzheimer’s disease are rare receptors, such as ABCA7 or TREM2, which contribute to ATP levels and lipid homeostasis. NLRX1 activation can counteract both inflammasome activation and diminished cellular ATP. 
 56


In models of brain injury, loss of NLRX1 worsens disease pathology, increasing oxidative stress and promoting metabolic dysfunction. Activation of NLRX1 in vitro protects against cell death in the context of inflammatory and oxidative injury. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 We intend to initiate GLP IND-enabling studies for NX-66 in 2021. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We intend to initiate a safety and tolerability study for NX-66 in normal healthy volunteers in the second half of 2022. 
 NX-73 for the treatment of asthma 
 Overview 
 NX-73 is a small molecule product candidate that targets NLRX1 that we are developing for the treatment of Asthma. NLRX1 is a mitochondria-associated receptor involved in down-regulating inflammation during bacterial and viral exposure, colitis, multiple sclerosis and chronic pulmonary disease. Asthma encompasses a wide range of allergic and inflammatory diseases. Severe sub-types of asthma, including both neutrophilic and eosinophilic manifestations, lack effective treatment methods. We believe that NX-73, if approved, has the potential to improve on the current treatment options through the potential to resolve neutrophil inflammation, improve pulmonary function and reverse underlying fibrosis. We intend to submit an IND for NX-73 in the second half of 2023. 
 Background on asthma and current treatments 
 Over 25 million patients in the United States have asthma, representing a $14 billion annual therapeutic market that is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% from 2019 to 2022. Multiple subtypes of asthma exist. Immunologically, these subtypes are dominated by a classification into type 2 and non-type 2. While most individuals with type 2 asthma will experience moderate response to standard treatments including corticosteroids, non-type 2 asthma, dominated by neutrophilic disease, is often refractory to these medications and results in severe, untreated disease in 10% to 15% of patients. The disease results in self-perpetuating disease in which airway epithelial cells are damaged and recruit neutrophils that chronically infiltrate the lung and contribute to epithelial cell damage. Limitations of current therapies for the treatment of asthma include: 
  
• | Failure to resolve neutrophilic inflammation. Corticosteroids, the main treatment for asthma, have been shown to promote the survival of neutrophils. Recent biologics and other treatments in development for severe eosinophilic asthma are focused on modulating Th2 and eosinophilic responses that leave Th17 and neutrophil inflammation unaffected. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incompletely reversible airway obstruction. Neutrophilic asthma is associated with chronic airway obstruction requiring frequent intervention and severe health complications. This suggests that structural or fibrotic changes may be present that are not addressed with current therapies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refractory patients. Neutrophilic disease results in a greater likelihood that a patient will be refractory to current treatment. Refractory asthma patients tend to present with higher neutrophil counts. The noneosinophilic, or neutrophilic, asthma population is roughly half of the overall asthma population. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our solution for the treatment of asthma 
 Neutrophilic asthma is commonly associated with occupational and environmental molecules and is likely caused by unresolving neutrophil infiltration resulting from deregulated repair of the epithelium. NLRX1 is a receptor expressed both within pulmonary immune cells and airway epithelial cells. NLRX1 is responsible for maintaining mitochondrial metabolism in airway epithelial cells and preventing oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the absence of NLRX1, airway epithelial cells produce higher levels of neutrophil chemoattractants, such as IL-8, and Th17 polarizing cytokines, such as IL-6, in response to DAMPs and PAMPs. Immunologically, NLRX1 has been associated with altered responses to viral and fungal diseases of the lung. In both cases, NLRX1 was observed to be beneficial, lessening the severity of disease through the innate immune system. We believe NX-73, if approved, may address an unmet clinical need in refractory neutrophilic asthma by: 
  
• | Resolving neutrophil inflammation. NLRX1 activation reduces IL-8 and other neutrophil chemoattractants in airway epithelial cells. NLRX1 is a potent controller of CD4+ T cell differentiation through the downregulation of Th17 cells by inhibition of LDH. Both factors can decrease the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 57


 
• | Improving epithelial cell health. Neutrophils can contribute to the death of epithelial cells through oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction. NLRX1 activation increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes and also maintains mitochondrial metabolism. The restoration of the epithelial barrier integrity will improve pulmonary function. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reversing underlying fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis may contribute to the inability to completely reverse airway obstruction. By resolving the neutrophil inflammation and decreasing TNF production, the activation and proliferation of fibroblasts will decrease, which can contribute to the improvement of fibrosis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 We intend to initiate a seven-day dose range finding study of NX-73 in rats up to doses of 1000 mg/kg, and PK studies testing the bioavailability and profile of NX-73 in rats in the therapeutic window (1-20 mg/kg) in the second half of 2021. We intend to initiate GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Following an expected IND submission in the second half of 2023, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 study in normal healthy volunteers will be in the first half of 2024. The normal healthy volunteer study will feature a standard single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose design testing a dose range 5-fold to 10-fold greater than projected therapeutic dose. The primary objective of the study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of NX-73 by frequency and severity of AEs, standard safety laboratory results, ECG and vital signs. The secondary objective will be to assess the PK of NX-73 in humans. 
 NX-73 for the treatment of COPD 
 Overview 
 NX-73 is a small molecule product candidate that targets NLRX1 that we are developing for the treatment of COPD. NLRX1 is a mitochondria-associated receptor involved in down-regulating inflammation during bacterial and viral exposure, colitis, multiple sclerosis and chronic pulmonary disease. COPD is an inflammatory disease of the lung characterized by chronic bronchitis and emphysema and caused primarily by environmental exposures and cigarette smoke. The current treatments for COPD primarily provide symptomatic relief and slightly reduce severe flares and do not reduce the rate of progressive obstruction. We believe that NX-73 has the potential to improve on the current treatment options through the potential to address both epithelial and immune functions. We intend to submit an IND for NX-73 in the second half of 2023. 
 Background on COPD and current treatments 
 COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, may exist in up to 10% of adults over 40 and is estimated to be up to $12 billion annual market growing with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 6% from 2018 to 2028. 
 The primary class of treatment in COPD is bronchodilators including both short- and long-acting beta2 agonists and muscarinic antagonists. Inhaled corticosteroids are also used in certain cases, often in combination with methylxanthines, which improve the response to corticosteroids. The most recent new class approval in COPD was a PDE4 inhibitor, for which 80% of patients experienced moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations, representing a 13% drop relative to placebo. PDE4 inhibition has struggled to penetrate the market, estimated to comprise 2% to 5%, attributable in part to mixed results during clinical development. Cytokine-based biologics have failed to improve respiratory function in clinical trials. Limitations of current therapies for the treatment of COPD include: 
  
• | Limiting effects on declining respiratory function. Current therapeutics for COPD primarily provide symptomatic relief and slightly reduce severe flares. Bronchodilators do not reduce the rate of progressive obstruction, in which patients have a higher likelihood of becoming refractory to treatment. This results in a limited impact on the overall mortality rate. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Failure to treat neutrophilic and severe disease. Bronchodilators provide little impact on the underlying inflammation present in COPD. While COPD patients with high eosinophil counts have partial response to corticosteroids, those without high eosinophils have limited response to any treatment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our solution for the treatment of COPD 
 Alveolar macrophages are a highly plastic phenotype capable of maintaining tissue homeostasis and inducing robust inflammation in the lung. They are central players in COPD and chronic pulmonary diseases. NLRX1 is suppressed in human COPD and its expression correlates with the degree of airflow limitation. In cigarette smoke induced animal models, lack of NLRX1 results in emphysematous destruction and high expression of IL-18. Mechanistically, NLRX1 inhibits the PAMP and DAMP mediated activation of MAVS, a key effector protein for the induction of IL-18 and IL-1ß, as well as decrease oxidative stress tied to the damage of the airway epithelium and activation of alveolar macrophages. 
 COPD has a large refractory population and a lack of therapies that prevent further decline in severe disease. We believe a significant market opportunity exists for therapeutics addressing both epithelial and immune functions. NLRX1 activation can ameliorate alveolar destruction. 
 We believe NX-73, if approved, has the potential to address the lack of immune-based therapies. With the exception of PDE4 inhibitors, COPD treatment primarily addresses the symptoms without modulating the underlying inflammation. Similar to asthma, corticosteroids fail to improve disease in patients with high neutrophil counts. NLRX1 activation may reduce the infiltration of neutrophils through decreased Th17 cells and decreased IL-8 production by airway epithelial cells. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 We intend to initiate GLP IND-enabling studies for NX-73 in the second half of 2023. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We intend to initiate a safety and tolerability study in normal healthy volunteers of NX-73 in the first half of 2024. 
 Our PLXDC2 pathway product candidate 
 The PLXDC2 pathway 
 PLXDC2 is a transmembrane receptor associated with immunoregulatory functions. Immunologically, PLXDC2 activation leads to the production of IL-10 and prevention of oxidative stress. PLXDC2 intercepts the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) signaling pathway. This leads to downstream inhibition of NF-κB and HIF-1α signaling that is associated with TNFα, IL-6, MCP1 and other cytokines. Further supporting this anti-inflammatory cascade is an inhibition of the semaphorin 4A/plexin B1 axis that regulates MAPK activation. Through proteolysis of the VEGF receptor, activation of PLXDC2 can also induce anti-angiogenic effects that can limit immune cell infiltration and defects in tissue vascularization and anti-fibrotic effects that can reduce the production of fibronectin.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The primary immune cell type affected by PLXDC2 activation is considered to be macrophages. When stimulated, PLXDC2 activated macrophages more closely associate with a non-inflammatory phenotype categorized by high expression of Retnla and Arg1 and secretion of IL-10. While macrophages are central to the effects of PLXDC2 activation, effects are also observed in adaptive immunity. In animal models, PLXDC2 activation is associated with decreased B cell maturation and lower local Th17 activation due in part to the inhibition of MAPK signaling and glycolysis that lessens proliferation. In addition to effects on the growth factor microenvironment, PLXDC2 activation is also associated with growth arrest in fibroblasts leading to decreased proliferation. This could offer the potential to halt tissue fibrosis that leads to deterioration of organ function. 
 The development of PLXDC2 focuses on diseases with implication of oxidative stress, fibrosis and angiogenesis. PLXDC2 is a highly relevant target for diabetic complications, such as nephropathy and retinopathy, due to the high levels of advanced glycation end-products that result from hyperglycemia. These indications, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, are implicated with defects in local growth factor production and innate immune cytokines that may be improved with PLXDC2 activation. 
 PX-69 for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy 
 Overview 
 PX-69 is a small molecule product candidate that targets PLXDC2 that we are developing for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a main complication in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is the leading cause of ESRD. While current treatments are effective as a preventative measure, they are less efficacious when initiated at later stages of disease. We believe that PX-69 has the potential to improve on the current treatment options through the potential to improve kidney function and address late stage renal disease. We intend to submit an IND for PX-69 in the first half of 2022. 
 Background on diabetic nephropathy and current treatments 
 Forty percent of diabetic patients will develop diabetic nephropathy, affecting both type 1 and type 2 diabetics and resulting in up to 10 million patients in the United States. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause for long-term renal dialysis and ESRD. The estimated global market for diabetic nephropathy is up to $3 billion annually with a compound annual growth rate of over 5% from 2014 to 2020. 
 Prolonged periods of hyperglycemia and dysregulated glucose metabolism increases the risk for many complications, from kidney failure to blindness to amputation of extremities. High blood glucose results in the build-up of multiple metabolites that can directly damage the kidney and cause oxidative stress. Patients often require high blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering drugs and dialysis resulting from these complications. 
 60


Currently, pharmacological management of diabetic nephropathy is managed through glycemic control and blood pressure medications. The most commonly prescribed treatments for diabetic nephropathy are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). These treatments are believed to function through improvement of a hemodynamic imbalance, reducing stress on the kidneys and overall inflammation. While effective as a preventative measure when early detection is possible, diminished efficacy of these therapies is observed when initiated at later stages of disease. These therapies unreliably decrease serum creatinine indicating that further improvement on removal of waste products is possible. 
 Our solution for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy 
 The native protein ligand of PLXDC2 is locally expressed in both the retina and kidney and is notably suppressed when damage to either organ occurs. In the kidney, the presence of this protein is associated with suppression of advanced glycation end-product signaling and inhibition of fibrosis. Many diabetic complications result from advanced glycation end-products which are formed from the reaction of high glucose levels with proteins and other macromolecules. By intercepting RAGE signaling, PLXDC2 prevents myriad downstream effects that lead to kidney damage. Primary among these mechanisms is the prevention of oxidative stress and high-glucose induced activation of NF-κB and HIF1α. Activation of PLXDC2 results in the downregulation of TNF, MCP1 and other cytokines. Inhibition of fibrosis, including a downregulation of fibronectin, is caused by inhibition of RAGE combined with VEGF receptor proteolysis. The second of these effects also serves to reduce angiogenesis, an additional process connected to diabetic nephropathy. Enhanced activation of PLXDC2 may therefore help return the tissue to homeostasis in the deficiency of the native ligand. 
 We believe PX-69, if approved, has the potential to improve on current therapies by: 
  
• | Providing direct antioxidant effects. PLXDC2 activation is associated with decreased NF-κB activation and lower intracellular reactive oxygen species. Combined with reduction of local hypoxia, PLXDC2 can improve the health and homeostasis of renal epithelial cells and podocytes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Addressing late-stage disease. PLXDC2 has the potential to intercept the angiogenic and fibrogenic signals that are more prevalent during late-stage disease. In the absence of improved screening, patients with stage 4 or higher renal disease will continue to have a higher likelihood of requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplant. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improvement of overall kidney function. The build-up of multiple waste products in the body can result in additional co-morbidities that contribute to the overall decline in health in diabetic individuals. Identification of novel treatment strategies in diabetic nephropathy may help to reduce these in a wider range of individuals.

 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 PX-69 will be tested in a seven-day dose range finding study in rats up to doses of 1,000 mg/kg in the second quarter of 2021. We intend to initiate PK studies testing the bioavailability and profile of PX-69 in rats in the therapeutic window (1-20 mg/kg) in the second quarter of 2021. We intend to initiate GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 Clinical development plan 
 Following an expected IND submission in the first half of 2022, we intend to initiate a Phase 1 study in normal healthy volunteers in the second half of 2022. The normal healthy volunteer study will feature a standard single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose design testing a dose range 5-fold to 10-fold greater than projected therapeutic dose. The primary objective of the study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of PX-69 by frequency and severity of AEs, standard safety laboratory results, ECG and vital signs. A secondary objective will be to assess the PK of PX-69 in humans. 
 PX-69 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
 Overview 
 PX-69 is a small molecule product candidate that targets PLXDC2 that we are developing for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a swelling and loss of mobility in joints caused by excessive inflammation and infiltration into the joint synovium. There is no clear advantage in terms of safety and efficacy for the current approved treatments. We believe that PX-69 has potential to improve on the modest efficacy observed with current treatments in rheumatoid arthritis due to disease-specific and general immune functions. We intend to submit an IND for PX-69 in the first half of 2022.

Background on rheumatoid arthritis and current treatments 
 Rheumatoid arthritis is a global health concern and affects approximately 1.3 million patients in the United States and represents an approximate $25 billion annual therapeutics market. The market is estimated to be the second largest specialty drug indication behind oncology. 
 Five classes of drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, DMARDs, biologics and JAK inhibitors) are used to manage rheumatoid arthritis. The rheumatoid arthritis market is fragmented due to no clear advantage in terms of safety and efficacy among these classes of therapies. The result is a lack of a defined treatment paradigm or order of escalation between classes. 
 Our solution for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
 Rheumatoid arthritis causes severe inflammation of joints leading to loss of mobility and intense pain. The underlying immunology of the synovial inflammation is complex involving the interplay of myeloid cells, T cells, fibroblasts and other structural cells of the synovium. High expression of TNF and IL-6 are central to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, with additional contributions by IL-1ß, IL-12, IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, MCP1, and TGF-ß. Together these cytokines can lead to leukocytic recruitment, bone remodeling, pannus formation, oxidative stress and hyperplasia of the joint lining. As a strong regulator of myeloid responses, including the production of TNF and IL-6 as well as overall infiltration and angiogenesis, PLXDC2 can serve as a novel target in rheumatoid arthritis. 
 Rheumatoid arthritis results from interactions between immune cells and synoviocytes that leads to joint swelling, pannus formation and bone loss. These interactions are exacerbated by increased angiogenesis driven by local hypoxia. PLXDC2 is a receptor for an anti-angiogenesis factor that limits angiogenesis through proteolysis of the VEGF receptor. The semaphorin 4A/plexin B1 axis is a major contributor to interactions between Th17 cells and synovial fibroblasts. The axis leads to downstream upregulation of MAPK and production of factors contributing to osteoclastogenesis. PLXDC2 is an inhibition of this pathway and MAPK activation. 
 We believe PX-69, if approved, has the potential to improve on the modest efficacy observed with current treatments in rheumatoid arthritis due to disease-specific and general immune functions. PLXDC2 has a greater potential to influence osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis than current therapeutics from a mechanistic standpoint. If combined with high tolerability, we believe PX-69 could be a disruptive therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. 
 Preclinical GLP toxicology 
 We intend to initiate GLP IND-enabling studies for PX-69 in the second quarter of 2021. 
 Clinical development plan 
 We intend to initiate a safety and tolerability study for PX-69 in normal healthy volunteers in the second quarter of 2022. 
 Manufacturing
Our drug substance and drug product manufacturing are conducted at third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in India and Switzerland. All of our manufacturers hold applicable licenses, certifications and/or approvals for cGMP manufacturing, analytical testing, packaging, and release operations from multiple drug regulation entities, including the FDA. Each manufacturer has also been independently qualified through our own internal qualification processes. 
 Multiple batches of BT-11 drug substance and drug product candidate have been completed with completed two-year room temperature stability data. BT-11 drug product is an immediate release tablet at multiple strengths. Process optimization, scale-up, manufacturing and production of registration batches are expected in 2021. Manufacture of NX-13 drug substance and drug product has been completed for Phase 1 studies with indications of room temperature stability in all stability assessments as of August 2020. NX-13 drug product candidate is an immediate release tablet at multiple strengths. Process optimization and scale-up for Phase 2 clinical trial supply will occur in 2021. Phase 3 process optimization, scale-up and registration batch manufacture are projected for completion in 2023. 
 62


We have recently begun the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity by developing relationships with new, qualified CMOs in other parts of the world. Additional CMOs for the manufacture of BT-11 and NX-13 drug substance and drug products are currently being identified, with each required to comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and have the relevant manufacturing expertise for the applicable product. We expect that the newly qualified CMOs will begin process transfer and scale-up activities by the end of 2020 with plans to begin cGMP clinical manufacture in 2021. Together with our current manufacturing capabilities, this added capacity and strategic placement is expected to satisfy the regulatory demands of each of the anticipated long-term commercial markets while also ensuring a continuance of supply. 
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and particularly the market for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies, compounding facilities, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 
 We are aware of several other products and product candidates as potential treatments for UC and Crohn’s disease that would compete with BT-11 and NX-13, if approved. In particular, we expect to compete against companies that produce biologic drugs that currently dominate the UC and Crohn’s disease market, as well as companies that produce the aminosalicylates, steroids and immunosuppressants that are currently used to treat patients with mild to moderate disease. If approved, BT-11 and NX-13 are expected to compete against companies that produce, or are developing, injectable biologic therapeutics such as AbbVie Inc., Eli Lilly and Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Holding Ltd., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. and UCB S.A., as well as companies that produce, or are developing, oral products such as Applied Molecular Transport Inc., Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Galapagos N.V., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Gossamer Bio, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. and Theravance Biopharma, Inc. 
 BT-11 and NX-13 are well differentiated orally active, gut-restricted, therapeutic candidates that are the first to target their respective pathways. We are not aware of any product candidate targeting the LANCL2, NLRX1, or PLXDC2 pathways in current clinical development. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than BT-11, NX-13 or any other product that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. We believe that our unique corporate culture, proprietary LANCE platform, and well-differentiated technology will help us effectively navigate the challenges associated with this competitive landscape targeting a large market of over $153 billion by 2025.

Intellectual Property Protection 
 We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Further, any issued patents may expire before the expected expiration dates disclosed above due to actions taken during patent prosecution, such as submission of a disclaimer surrendering the term of a patent beyond a certain date. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. While there are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims relating to any of the patents or patent applications described above, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings or third-party claims at a later date or once any patent is granted. 
 The term of a patent depends upon the legal term of patents in the particular country in which it is obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, which permits in some cases restoration of patent term as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In certain circumstances, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the unextended expiration date of the U.S. patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the approved drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available. There is no guarantee, however, that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the United States and the national patent offices in Europe or other jurisdictions, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates, and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential, and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations and practices to protect our trade secrets. 
 Freedom to Operate 
 We have obtained legal opinions on the freedom to operate with BT-11 and NX-13. The legal opinions have concluded that we have freedom to operate with BT-11, NX-13, and their uses in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as UC and CD.

Government regulation 
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
 U.S. government regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical studies 
 Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 67


Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent submission ex-US). In addition, an IRB or ethics committee, or EC, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.

• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Marketing approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 68


The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Special FDA expedited review and approval programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. 
 69


In addition, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation for a drug if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product including involvement of senior managers, and, like fast track products, are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. Both fast track and breakthrough therapy products are also eligible for accelerated approval and/or priority review, if relevant criteria are met. 
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
 Once an NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten- month review periods are measured from the 60-day filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track breakthrough therapy designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on responding to requests for expanded access. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 Orphan designation 
 The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or Biologics License Application, or a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for 
 70


the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 71


Coverage and reimbursement 
 Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 U.S. healthcare reform 
 There have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA, among other things, imposed a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contained substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. 
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurance tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their 
 72


existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Administration’s proposals. The FDA also recently released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of President Trump’s Executive Order announced on July 24, 2020 that directed HHS to finalize the Canadian drug importation proposed rule previously issued by HHS and make other changes allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada. The FDA final rule provides guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 until January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for fixed fees to pharmacy benefit managers for certain services rendered to manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation, particularly in light of the recent U.S. presidential election. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
 Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 We will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal, state and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. These fraud and abuse and transparency laws may impact, among other things, our financial arrangements and proposed sales, marketing and education programs. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return 
 73


for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Moreover, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through “qui tam” whistleblower actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Additionally, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 In addition, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufactures will also be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives during the previous year. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities. In addition, certain states and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 Government regulation outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 74


Data privacy and security 
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, processing, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities as well as their covered subcontractors. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. 
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
 In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. In Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EEA. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA.to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, following Brexit and the end of the Transition Period, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 33 full-time employees in activities such as research and development, finance, clinical development, regulatory affairs, project management and administration. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 In order to successfully implement our development and commercialization plans and strategies, and as we transition into operating as a public company, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including: 
  
• | identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies’ review process for BT-11, NX-13 and any other future product candidates, while complying with any contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties we may have; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.
