Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions and services throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We provide integrated technology solutions and services which include toll and violations management, title and registration, automated safety solutions, and other data driven solutions to our customers, which include rental car companies (“RACs”), fleet management companies (“FMCs”), other large fleet owners, municipalities, school districts and violation issuing authorities. Our solutions simplify the smart mobility ecosystem by utilizing what we believe are industry leading capabilities, information and technology expertise, and integrated hardware and software to efficiently facilitate the automated processing of tolls and violations for hundreds of agencies and millions of end users annually, while also making cities and roadways safer for everyone.
 Based in Mesa, Arizona, we operate through two primary segments – Commercial Services and Government Solutions. Through our Commercial Services segment, we believe we are the market leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in the United States and Canada. In Europe, we provide violations processing through Euro Parking Collection plc (“EPC”) and consumer tolling services through Pagatelia S.L (“Pagatelia”). Through our Government Solutions segment, we believe we are the market-leading provider of automated safety solutions to municipalities, counties, school districts and law enforcement agencies (which are collectively referred to herein as “local government agencies”), including services and technology that enable photo enforcement via road safety camera programs related to red-light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes.
 Segments 
 Commercial Services 
 Our Commercial Services segment generated approximately $180.9 million in revenue for 2020, or approximately 46% of our total revenue. The Commercial Services segment is the market-leading provider of automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners in North America. Through our established relationships with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States, we provide an automated and outsourced administrative solution for our customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers and benefits to the tolling and issuing authorities. Without our toll and violations management solutions, our customers would bear the expense and administrative burden of matching tolls or violations to the responsible vehicle and driver, and then either transferring liability or paying the fee or fine directly (for which it may then need to bill the driver) – in either case within specified time periods to avoid the potential imposition of penalties. We mitigate these risks by ensuring timely payment for tolls and violations incurred by our customers’ vehicles or by performing timely transfers of liability on our customers’ behalf, and then billing and collecting from the driver as applicable. We also manage regional toll transponder installation and vehicle association, an especially critical and highly complex component for RAC and FMC customers, to ensure that the transponder (and corresponding toll transactions) are associated with the correct vehicle. 
 We have long-standing relationships with the three largest RACs in the United States – Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, Inc. and The Hertz Corporation – among others, as well as the six largest FMCs in the United States, which are Element, ARI, Enterprise Fleet Management, Wheels, LeasePlan and Donlen. We provide coverage for more than 95% of all toll roads in the United States and currently one toll road in Canada, processing more than 171 million toll transactions and 1.3 million traffic violations in 2020. Following the acquisition of EPC in April 2018, we extended our customer base to include violation-issuing authorities in Europe and expanded our commercial services to include identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking, and public transportation related violations incurred by vehicle drivers not originating in the country where the violation occurred. We expanded our presence in Europe to include electronic toll collection on highways and car parks throughout Spain, Portugal, France and Italy through our acquisition of Pagatelia in October 2019.

Government Solutions 
 Our Government Solutions segment generated approximately $212.7 million in revenue for 2020, or approximately 54% of our total revenue. This segment works with local government agencies to help make cities and roadways safer for everyone through automated safety solutions. We provide local government agencies with road safety cameras to detect and process traffic violations for red-light, speed, school bus, and city bus lanes. Our proprietary hardware and software technologies provide local government agencies the information, data, and automated end-to-end administrative capabilities to enforce traffic violations through photo enforcement. On behalf of our customers, we install, maintain, and manage automated safety solution hardware and software that processes event data, applies customer specific rules and connects a traffic violation to the responsible driver or vehicle owner. Additionally, upon law enforcement’s determination that a violation has occurred, we manage the citation mailing, billing, and other administrative tasks on behalf of many of our customers.
 We are a critical partner to local government agencies across the United States, helping to facilitate and increase public safety, improve public transportation, enhance law enforcement officer safety and act as a police force multiplier by allowing law enforcement to focus on serious crimes rather than routine traffic violations. We currently have more than 5,800 red-light, speed, school bus and city bus lane road safety cameras installed across nearly 160 jurisdictions and school districts in 17 states and the District of Columbia. On an annual basis, we process approximately 10.9 million violations on behalf of our municipality and school district customers, including New York City, Seattle, Washington D.C., Austin Independent School District, Philadelphia, Orlando and Atlanta Public Schools. In January 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of outstanding equity of Redflex Holdings Limited (“Redflex”), which, if completed, would expand our presence in the United States, Europe and Australia.
 The Industries in Which We Operate 
 Tolling 
 Tolling is an important feature of the United States transportation landscape, with United States tolling authorities collecting nearly $21 billion in toll revenues in 2018. As a result, tolling is one of the most effective and equitable ways to pay for highway infrastructure. In addition to the overall growth in tolling reflected in the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration’s tracking of total toll bridge, tunnel and road mileage, there is also a growing movement towards cashless and all-electronic tolling, which allows for more convenient, accurate and reliable processing and collection of toll incurrence fees and mitigates congestion on toll roads. The tolling industry is highly fragmented and complex as it is comprised of more than 50 tolling authorities, each operating as independent organizations with specific coverage regions and disparate technology platforms. 
Commercial Fleet 
 Our Commercial Services customers consist of RACs, FMCs and other large fleet owners. RAC industry revenue in the United States fell 27% in 2020 compared to 2019, due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic. The nearly $23 billion United States RAC industry is highly consolidated, with three companies accounting for a significant majority of United States RAC revenues in 2020. In addition to the larger nationwide RACs, smaller independent companies operate regionally throughout the United States. The RAC industry is driven by increases in the average number of days a vehicle is rented. While the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected RAC industry trends in fiscal 2020, the length of rentals returned to previous seasonality patterns beginning in the second half of 2020. The industry is also being impacted by the growth in usage cases for rental cars in urban areas and partnerships with rideshare providers to rent vehicles to their independent drivers, leading to additional rental transactions. Management believes the European RAC market, while more fragmented than the U.S. market, is large in size. According to Automotive Fleet Magazine, there are nearly 6.4 million fleet vehicles in the United States, approximately 3.1 million of which are under management by FMCs. The fleet industry in North America is primarily centered on vocational vehicles utilized for transporting people along with the tools, parts and equipment required to perform their jobs, largely insulating the industry from disruptions caused by today’s rideshare and carshare services. In Europe, the FMC market is estimated to be more than 6 million vehicles, with over half under management by the top five European FMCs.

Automated Safety 
 As the number of vehicle miles traveled continues to increase and cities and municipalities struggle to deal with the challenges of managing traffic enforcement, photo-enforcement solutions continue to play a prominent role in comprehensive safety initiatives. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, speeding and red-light running cause around 10,000 fatalities each year. In 2020, the Congressional Research Service found cameras to be an effective tool for law enforcement and other agencies to reduce the number of traffic-related violations, collisions, injuries and fatalities, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials has called on states to support greater use of automated speed enforcement. A 2019 Accident Analysis & Prevention article reported that that red-light cameras reduce total crashes by as much as 12%. A 2019 research article published in PLOS ONE noted that speed cameras reduce traffic collisions by as much as 15% on average for the treated sites. Additionally, programs like Vision Zero, a collaborative campaign helping communities reach their goals of eliminating all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, across most major U.S. cities, are driving capital investment to make meaningful strides in traffic safety.
Growth Strategies 
 Benefit from Strong Industry Tailwinds 
 We believe there is significant opportunity in both Commercial Services and Government Solutions as states, counties, and municipalities seek creative solutions to address reduced tax revenues and budgets for roads and other transportation infrastructure.
 In Commercial Services, we believe that as state and local governments fund a growing list of infrastructure, maintenance and construction projects, there will be an increase in the number of toll roads, including new express and high occupancy lanes in urban areas. We expect this trend will also increase utilization of dynamic tolling, which allows toll rates to fluctuate based on traffic trends and real-time congestion. In addition, nearly half of the toll roads in the United States have transitioned to cashless or all-electronic payment. These trends create significant opportunities for us to expand our market presence while developing relationships with both new and existing RACs, FMCs, consumers and tolling authorities. 
 In Government Solutions, public attention given to traffic safety issues for drivers, pedestrians, children, bicyclists and law enforcement is intensifying and state and local governments are facing shortfalls in transportation revenue. In this context, smart technology solutions have emerged as an effective and revenue-positive method to address traffic safety issues. We believe that as public focus intensifies, the demand for our Government Solutions offerings will grow as well, and that we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 
 Expand Platform with New Products and New and Growing End Markets 
 We are an industry leader in the deployment of products and services that meet the increasingly complex and continuously evolving requirements of both existing and new customers. We are continuously looking toward the future, ensuring the development of relevant solutions today that will work tomorrow. We seek to understand developing customer, consumer, and government trends that will shape tomorrow’s smart mobility experiences both in the United States and internationally, all in an effort to ensure more people around the world reach their destination safely and easily. 
 
We believe leveraging our differentiated capabilities into new and growing end markets, such as ridesharing, carsharing and autonomous vehicles, provides attractive growth opportunities. The ridesharing and carsharing market, which includes vehicles leased to individual drivers, gives us a low-risk opportunity to grow Commercial Services revenues while at the same time insulating us from any market shift between ridesharing, carsharing and RACs. Further, this growth prospect comes at little additional investment as we are able to leverage the same technologies and solutions we have already developed for our RAC and FMC customers. As an already established leader, we believe we are well-positioned to be a first mover and to become a provider of choice in these new end markets. 
 7

Urban enforcement, curb management and citation processing solutions in the smart city movement also present significant opportunities for us. Our existing technologies and solutions could be adopted to take advantage of this market, providing an additional avenue for growth. 
 As state and local governments seek solutions to increase mobility and safety solutions in a challenging revenue environment, our Government Solutions business unit represents an opportunity to leverage our long-standing relationships with state and local governments in order to provide other smart mobility technology solutions, such as automatic license plate recognition, and new developing technologies, such as connected vehicle technology. 
 Expand Global Footprint 
 We believe there is significant opportunity to expand into attractive markets across Europe and beyond, and to that end, we have established a location in the Netherlands to serve as our European headquarters from which we are launching our RAC and FMC business in Europe. In September 2019, we entered into a partnership with APRR, Europe’s fourth-largest motorway operator, which enables us to provide our toll management services to French customers. In January 2021, we signed an agreement with Rent A Car France to expand electronic toll collection throughout France after a successful pilot program. Also in January 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of outstanding equity of Redflex, which, if completed, would expand our presence in the United States, Europe and Australia.
 We also intend to leverage our recent acquisitions of EPC and Pagatelia and the anticipated acquisition of Redflex to further bolster our growth into new and existing markets globally. 
 Through EPC we now have the capability to provide services in more than 18 languages and more than 10 currencies and to leverage existing connections with approximately 30 vehicle licensing authorities and over 450 toll and ticket-issuing authorities for whom we bill violators in more than 130 countries. Additionally, Pagatelia has established relationships with tolling authorities throughout Spain, Portugal, France and Italy, through which it offers interoperable electronic tolling both directly to consumers and through white-label partners. Through these recent acquisitions we have an opportunity to provide existing and new RAC and FMC customers with a convenient and effective solution similar to our current offering in the United States. 
 Pursue Accretive Acquisitions 
 In addition to organic growth initiatives, we have significant opportunities to increase our competitive positioning and strengthen our portfolio of products and solutions through strategic acquisitions. We have demonstrated the ability to identify and execute strategic acquisitions, as we did with Highway Toll Administration LLC and Canada Highway Toll Administration (collectively, “HTA”) and EPC in 2018 and Pagatelia in 2019, as well as our recent agreement to acquire Redflex in 2021. We constantly monitor the market for potential acquisition targets, which are evaluated based on their potential strategic impact, including growth potential, synergies, end-market development, customer relationships, technology, and cash flow. Our management team has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and driving synergies, and has identified a strong pipeline for future acquisitions. 
Products 
 Commercial Services 
 Toll management solutions.
We provide fully outsourced toll management solutions for our RAC and FMC customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers via our established relationships and integrations with more than 50 individual tolling authorities throughout the United States. This comprehensive network allows RAC and FMC drivers the convenience of using cashless and all-electronic tolls. Additionally, this service helps prevent the liability and business disruption of costly toll violations incurred by vehicles owned by RAC and FMC customers and eliminates their need to manage a nationwide program internally. Our proprietary software technology and hardware allow us to effectively match a toll to the specific RAC or FMC vehicle and driver so that the toll can accurately and reliably be billed and collected on behalf of, or directly from, the RAC or FMC. Toll management solutions accounted for approximately 36% of our 2020 revenues. 
 8

Violations management solutions.
Our violations management solutions process violations incurred by the drivers of RAC and FMC vehicles by working with more than 8,000 domestic violation issuing authorities (more than 400 of which we are directly integrated with) to either pay the fine on behalf of the vehicle owner (for which we are able to bill the driver) or to transfer liability directly to the vehicle driver. Vehicle-issued violations include parking and photo enforcement violations. In Europe, we specialize in the identification, notification, and collection of unpaid traffic, parking and public transport related fees, charges, and penalties issued to foreign registered vehicles or persons on behalf of issuing authorities in more than 17 European countries. Violation management solutions accounted for approximately 7% of our 2020 revenues. 
 Title and registration solutions.
Our title and registration solutions provide RAC and FMC customers with an integrated, end-to-end solution for managing vehicle titles and registrations and annual renewals. We provide automated title and registration solutions by leveraging connections with individual departments of motor vehicles for electronic title and registration processing in 20 states. Title and registration solutions accounted for approximately 3% of our 2020 revenues. 
 Government Solutions 
 We serve as a value-add partner to local government agencies by providing road safety cameras that promote traffic safety and reduce traffic violations. We work with our customers to identify problematic traffic areas and install, maintain, and manage the technology platform needed to capture images or videos of drivers committing traffic violations. Red-light cameras are placed at intersections to capture vehicles running red lights. Similarly, speed safety cameras are used to capture vehicles exceeding speed limits, either on a fixed basis or in a mobile platform, and often in school zones. School bus cameras are fixed to the side of buses to capture vehicles passing school buses with extended stop arms. Finally, bus lane cameras are designed to capture vehicles illegally driving in restricted bus lanes. 
 Applying rules specified by each customer, we automatically send the captured event to the designated enforcement agency of the customer, where an authorized individual determines if a violation occurred. Direct service revenue from red-light cameras, speed cameras, school bus cameras, and city bus lane cameras for red-light, speed, school bus and city bus lane solutions accounted for approximately 36% of our 2020 revenues. Other segment service revenue consists primarily of ancillary revenue streams, including product revenues and other ancillary services, which comprise 3% of total revenue. Product sales to customers are not recurring and are dependent on our customers’ needs, and account for 15% of total revenue.
 Customers 
 We have a diverse customer base across the United States, Canada, and Europe. We are a top provider of toll management solutions, violations management solutions, and title and registration solutions for nearly every major RAC and FMC provider nationwide, including Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Fox Rent a Car, Sixt Rent A Car, Element, ARI, Donlen, Wheels and The Hertz Corporation. In addition, we provide automated safety solutions to local government agencies including New York City, Seattle, Washington D.C., Austin Independent School District, Philadelphia, Orlando and Atlanta Public Schools. For many of our customers, we provide more than one product or service offering, addressing the diverse and varied needs of our clients. 
Competition 
 There is no single competitor that provides a similarly broad suite of solutions. However, in our Government Solutions segment, we face competition in certain automated safety solutions from other vendors in the areas of red-light, school bus and speed photo enforcement. In our Commercial Services segment, we face competition from both our own customers, as they may choose to invest in their own internal solutions, and vendors offering or seeking to offer new technologies or financial models, and we must continue to innovate for our offerings to remain competitive.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We take steps to protect new intellectual property to safeguard our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and believe we take appropriate action against infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement, and to identify strategic opportunities. 
 Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. We own approximately 61 U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. Patents expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages. 
 Our business relies on both internally developed and externally licensed software to operate and provide our systems and deliver our services. We claim copyright on all internally developed software. We generally rely on common law protection for our copyrighted works. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to assure our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software, we rely on contracts to retain our continued access for our business usage. 
 We have approximately 120 registrations and pending applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for trademarks and service marks, reflecting our many products and services. These registrations and applications include our historic brands, as well as Verra Mobility. These marks may have a perpetual life, subject to periodic renewal and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. We vigorously enforce and protect our marks. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices regulating matters such as data privacy, photo enforcement, consumer protection, procurement, licensing requirements, anti-kickback, equal employment, minimum wages and the environment, among others. Our operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, (“USDOT”), the Federal Trade Commission, (“FTC”), the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as comparable state and local agencies, including the departments of transportation, departments of motor vehicles, and offices of inspector general. Following the acquisition of EPC and Pagatelia, and in connection with our European expansion efforts, we are now subject to laws, regulations and administrative practices addressing many of these same matters in Europe, including those specifically relating to accessing and use of information obtained from vehicle licensing authorities, as well as European regulations to traffic enforcement and collections and other financial and banking regulations. 
 As part of our business, we collect, process, use and disclose personal information directly or for our customers and, therefore, are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of personal information, including the U.S. Driver Privacy Protection Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union (the “E.U.”), the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the United Kingdom (the “UK Data Protection Act”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and other state privacy laws in the United States. We are also subject to similar restrictions and audit requirements pursuant to our contracts with the organizations from which we gain access to personal information, such as departments of motor vehicles and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System. Privacy laws and regulations are constantly evolving and changing, are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among countries and state and local jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules. As we expand our operations in foreign countries, or as U.S. federal or state law changes, our liability exposure and the complexity and cost of compliance with data and privacy requirements, including the GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act, the CCPA and other US state privacy laws, will increase. Laws and practices regarding handling and use of personal and other information by companies have also come under increased public scrutiny, and governmental authorities, consumer agencies and consumer advocacy groups have called for increased regulation and changes in industry practices.

Automated photo enforcement camera programs in the United States are typically regulated at the state and local level, not the federal level. Since 2010, there have been over 1,500 pieces of legislation introduced nationwide related to the photo enforcement industry. In general, photo enforcement is administrated by local government agencies, under either state enabling legislation or under home rule authority established under the relevant state constitution. Where enabling legislation is not required, local ordinances impose further restrictions within a given jurisdiction. Whether in a state requiring enabling legislation or in home-rule states where municipalities pass ordinances permitting photo enforcement, if the legislation or ordinance is subsequently repealed, not renewed if required, or if the authority for a local ordinance is revoked, photo enforcement activities would stop. At times, state Attorneys General have issued opinions interpreting photo enforcement laws and the permissibility of certain practices or other requirements of practice that further restrict private activities. For example, the Attorneys General of Arizona, Tennessee and Virginia have each issued opinions in recent years that impacted photo enforcement activities. 
 State and local regulation affect our Commercial Services segment as well, particularly with respect to tolling. Over the past few years, bills have been introduced in multiple states to limit whether and how much RACs can charge their customers for the use of a toll transponder, limit the administrative penalties and fees that can be assessed for processing tolls, and/or impose increased disclosure requirements on RACs with respect to tolling charges. In addition, there has been an increase in interest and greater focus on RAC tolling programs from state Attorneys General related to tolling issues from a consumer protection perspective.
 Our Government Solutions customers are typically local government agencies, and our operations within this segment are therefore subject to state and local procurement laws pertaining to gifts and entertainment, payments of commissions and contingency fees, conflicts of interest, licensing and permitting requirements and other matters. These laws are overseen by different government agencies, depending on the jurisdiction, including departments of procurements services, contracting offices and offices of inspector general. In large municipalities, many of which have their own offices of the inspector general, these laws and regulations tend to be much more detailed and impose greater restrictions.
 To successfully navigate this regulatory landscape, we have a dedicated government relations team that works with state legislators and local authorities, often with the help of lobbyists and consultants, to track and help support favorable camera-enforcement safety and toll-related legislation. Through this network, we have a presence in every state in which our Government Solutions segment does business. These lobbying activities are subject to state and local lobbying regulations and registration requirements. 
 In connection with the installation of photo enforcement systems, we or our customers routinely obtain permits from various state and local permitting authorities, and we monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations of the USDOT and state departments of transportation relating to matters such as training, policies and procedures. As a government contractor providing photo enforcement services directly or through subcontractors (including design, engineering, construction, installation, and maintenance) in various locations throughout the country, we are at times required to obtain licenses regarding general contracting, performance of engineering services, performance of electrical work, performance of private investigative work and processing license plate and related personal information, and periodically receive notices from regulatory authorities regarding these matters and inquiring as to our compliance with the applicable state and local laws and regulations. 
 We believe we are in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate our business. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, fines, penalties, revocation of permits or licenses, cessation of operations in a given jurisdiction and other adverse consequences. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.
