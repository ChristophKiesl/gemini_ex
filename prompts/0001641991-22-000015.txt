These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses’ or our industries’ actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Such statements may address our plans, our strategies, our prospects, or changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) or in other sections of this document. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors, and forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. In addition, management’s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of continuing operations, which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets.
All the forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in this document, including under the heading "Risk Factors" and in any documents incorporated by reference herein that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS
Our Business
SPX FLOW, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“SPX FLOW,” ‘‘the Company,’’ “we,” “us,” or “our”) operate in two business segments. Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, SPX FLOW improves the world through innovative and sustainable solutions. The product offering of the Company's operations is concentrated in process technologies that perform mixing, blending, fluid handling, separation, thermal heat transfer and other activities that are integral to processes performed across a wide variety of nutrition, health and precision solution markets. In 2021, SPX FLOW had approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenues, with approximately 40%, 35%, and 25% from sales into the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions, respectively, and has operations in more than 30 countries and sales in more than 140 countries.
Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, mixers, filters, air dryers, hydraulic tools, homogenizers, separators and heat exchangers, along with the related aftermarket parts and services, supports global industries, including nutrition and health, chemical processing, compressed air and mining. From an end-market perspective, in 2021, approximately 44% of our revenues were from sales into the Nutrition and Health end markets and approximately 56% were from sales into the Precision Solutions end markets. Our core strengths include expertise in rotating, actuating and hydraulic equipment, a highly skilled workforce, global capabilities, product breadth, and a deep application knowledge that enables us to optimize configuration and create custom-engineered solutions for diverse processes.
Sale of SPX FLOW
On December 12, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with LSF11 Redwood Acquisitions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Redwood Star Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), providing for, on the terms and subject to the conditions therein, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury shares, owned by Parent or Merger Sub or held by any holders who have properly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Delaware law) will automatically be canceled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $86.50, without interest thereon.
In connection with the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger in accordance with Delaware law.
The Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, (1) receipt of the vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger Agreement; (2) the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (3) obtaining certain consents from government entities under applicable foreign merger control laws; and (4) the absence of any law or order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger. Parent’s obligations to consummate the Merger are conditioned upon, without limitation, the absence of a material adverse change and obtaining certain consents from government entities under applicable foreign merger control and foreign direct investment laws. The Merger Agreement also includes certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, termination fees may be owed by the Company to Parent, depending on the circumstances surrounding a termination.
If the Merger is consummated, we anticipate that the shares of Company Common Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
As further discussed in MD&A below, the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or "COVID-19 pandemic") had an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These adverse impacts began in the first quarter of 2020, continued through 2020 and 2021, and are expected to continue in 2022, but we are unable to determine the extent, duration, or nature of further impacts at this time. Although certain of our product lines (e.g., shorter-cycle product lines within our Precision Solutions reportable segment) have been impacted more than others in our portfolio, we believe that our diverse set of products, along with our strong balance sheet position and available liquidity, position us well to mitigate further potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its variants. For example, because we serve customers that produce food, beverages, personal care items, cleaning products, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals, and serve critical infrastructure and industrial enablement functions, a majority, but not all, of our products, services and operations have been classified as “essential” under various governmental orders restricting business activities implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have temporarily closed certain of our offices and engineering, service and manufacturing centers during 2020 and 2021, and may be required to close additional facilities in the future in response to governmental orders, other COVID-19 pandemic safety-related concerns or in response to market conditions affected by COVID-19, our manufacturing facilities have not experienced significant interruptions in operations to date.
In terms of liquidity, as of December 31, 2021, we had over $310 of cash and equivalents on hand and, as discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, approximately $495 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and debt repayments of $20.0 due annually under primary debt obligations until August 2026. During the past year, we have taken actions to manage costs and cash flows, including reducing discretionary spending, and will continue to assess the actual and expected impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and any requirements for further actions. 
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our continuing operations are organized into two reportable segments — the Nutrition and Health segment and the Precision Solutions segment. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company renamed its former "Food and Beverage" segment to the "Nutrition and Health" segment and, during the second quarter of 2021, the Company renamed its former "Industrial" segment to the "Precision Solutions" segment. Accordingly, all current and comparative period financial information for these segments has been presented as the Nutrition and Health segment and the Precision Solutions segment in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than the changes in name, there were no changes to the segments and there has been no change to prior period financial information of the segments.
The following summary describes the products and services offered by our reportable segments:
Nutrition and Health:  The Nutrition and Health reportable segment operates in a regulated, global industry with customers who demand highly engineered process solutions. Key demand drivers include dairy consumption, emerging market capacity expansion, sustainability and productivity initiatives, customer product innovation and food safety. Key products for the segment include homogenizers, pumps, valves, separators and heat exchangers. We also design and assemble process systems that integrate many of these products for our customers. Key brands include APV, Gerstenberg Schroeder, Seital and Waukesha Cherry-Burrell. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Fristam Pumps, GEA Group AG, Krones AG, Südmo, Tetra Pak International S.A. and various regional companies.
Precision Solutions: The Precision Solutions reportable segment primarily serves customers in the chemical, air treatment, mining, pharmaceutical, marine, infrastructure construction, general industrial and water treatment industries. Key demand drivers of this segment are tied to macroeconomic conditions and growth in the respective end markets we serve. Key products for the segment are air dryers, filtration equipment, mixers, pumps, hydraulic technologies and heat exchangers. Key brands include Airpel, APV, Bolting Systems, Bran+Luebbe, Deltech, Hankison, Jamix, Jemaco, Johnson Pump, LIGHTNIN, Philadelphia Mixing Solutions, POSI LOCK, Power Team, Stelzer, Stone and Uutechnic. The segment's primary competitors are Alfa Laval AB, Chemineer Inc., EKATO, Enerpac, IDEX Viking Pump, Ingersoll Rand Inc., KSB AG, Lewa, Parker Domnick Hunter, Prominent and various regional companies. 
Acquisitions
As part of our long-term strategy, we plan to evaluate potential acquisitions that (a) are complementary to our existing products and services, (b) increase our relevance to customers and our capabilities to serve them, (c) expand our global capabilities and accelerate our localization strategy and (d) expand our end market reach.
During the third quarter of 2020, we completed the acquisition of POSI LOCK, Inc. ("POSI LOCK"), a manufacturer of hydraulic and mechanical pullers used to remove certain parts from equipment in a variety of industries ranging from power transmission and light to heavy industrial applications, for a cash purchase price of $10.0. The pro forma effects of the acquisition of POSI LOCK are not material to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the first quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition of approximately 98% of the issued and outstanding shares of Plc Uutechnic Group Oyj ("UTG Mixing Group"), a former public company and producer of various mixing solutions for the chemical, food, metallurgical and fertilizer, environmental technology, water treatment and pharmaceuticals markets, for a cash purchase price of $38.0. The remaining 2% of issued and outstanding shares were acquired during the second quarter of 2021, with nominal impact to the total cash purchase price. UTG Mixing Group generated approximately $19.6 in revenues from the acquisition date through December 31, 2021 and its results are reported in our Precision Solutions reportable segment.
During the second quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition of Philadelphia Mixing Solutions, Ltd. ("Philadelphia Mixing"), a manufacturer of in-tank mixing solutions and provider of various technical services and field support, for a cash purchase price of $64.3. Philadelphia Mixing generated approximately $31.8 in revenues from the acquisition date through December 31, 2021 and its results are reported in our Precision Solutions reportable segment.
See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions, including (a) the allocation of purchase price paid for these acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of their respective acquisition dates, and (b) the pro forma combined results of operations of the Company, UTG Mixing Group and Philadelphia Mixing for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as if these acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2020. 
Divestitures
We periodically review and negotiate potential divestitures in the ordinary course of business, some of which are or may be material. As a result of this continuous review, we initiated a process in 2019 to divest a substantial portion of our former Power and Energy reportable segment, excluding the Bran+Luebbe product line (collectively, the “Disposal Group”). In connection with this initiative, we narrowed our strategic focus by separating our process solutions technologies, comprised of our Nutrition and Health and our Precision Solutions reportable segments, plus the Bran+Luebbe product line, from our flow control application technologies, comprised of the Disposal Group. Given the specific capabilities that are unique to each category of technologies and businesses, our further intent was that each business would, through a process of separation, be positioned to improve its respective service to customers through the narrowing of such strategic focus.
In connection with the May 2019 announcement and the continued development of the divestiture process thereafter, we reported the Disposal Group as “held-for-sale”, and as discontinued operations, initially as of the end of our second quarter of 2019. As the operations and organizational structure of the remaining business of the former Power and Energy segment (primarily the Bran+Luebbe product line as noted above) have been absorbed into the Precision Solutions reportable segment, and the operating results of the Precision Solutions reportable segment (now including the Bran+Luebbe product line) are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, we have reclassified the results of that remaining business into the Precision Solutions reportable segment. The results of operations, cash flows, and assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations and our Precision Solutions segment, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, reflect this presentation.
In November 2019, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which we agreed, indirectly through certain of our subsidiaries, to sell the Disposal Group to the Buyer for a gross purchase price of $475.0 (the “Transaction”). The gross purchase price of $475.0 was subject to (i) reductions based upon the level of certain deductions of the Disposal Group at the closing date, and (ii) certain adjustments based upon the level of net working capital, cash and debt of the Disposal Group at the closing date. The deductions include, for example, components of the Contract Liabilities and certain other current and long-term liabilities of the Disposal Group, as well as deductions for budgeted but un-incurred capital expenditures and other business infrastructure costs measured over periods defined in the Sale Agreement, but in all cases which expired at the closing date. 
On March 30, 2020, we completed the sale of substantially all Disposal Group businesses and received proceeds from the Buyer of $406.2, based on an estimate of certain adjustments to the gross purchase price as of the closing date and as discussed further above and, to a lesser extent, certain fees. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and upon receiving relevant regulatory approvals, we completed the sale of the remaining net assets of the Disposal Group, based in India, to the Buyer for total proceeds of $6.3. Considering proceeds received from the Buyer of $406.2 in the second quarter of 2020, net of cash and restricted cash of $7.3 included in the net assets of the Disposal Group which were sold at that time, proceeds of $6.3 received related to consummation of the sale of the India business less cash paid of $4.1 for a net working capital settlement during the fourth quarter of 2020, cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect net proceeds of $401.1 from disposition of the Disposal Group.
See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestiture process, as well as further details regarding the results and significant non-cash operating items and capital expenditures of discontinued operations. See also Note 4 for information regarding a less significant disposal of a business in the Precision Solutions reportable segment, based in our Asia Pacific region, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020, and the sale of the primary assets of a product line in the Precision Solutions reportable segment, which occurred during the third quarter of 2021.
Unless otherwise indicated, amounts reported in Part I of this Form 10-K pertain to continuing operations only.
Research and Development
We are engaged in research and development programs designed to improve existing products and manufacturing methods and to develop new products to better serve our current and future customers. We place particular emphasis on the development of new products that are compatible with, and build upon, our manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 125 domestic and 287 foreign patents, including 17 patents that were issued in 2021, covering a variety of our products and manufacturing methods. We also own a number of registered trademarks. Although in the aggregate our patents and trademarks are of considerable importance in the operation of our business, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of such importance that its absence would adversely affect our ability to conduct business as presently constituted. We are both a licensor and licensee of patents. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors - Our technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.”
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,900 employees in 33 countries. While none of our approximately 1,400 U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, certain of our non-U.S. employee groups are covered by various collective labor arrangements. While we generally have experienced satisfactory labor relations, we are subject to potential collective labor campaigns, work stoppages, collective labor negotiations and other potential labor disputes. 
Our “Focus on People and Culture” initiative prioritizes ensuring the safety of our employees, fostering a culture of belonging, supporting open communication channels with our team members, surveying employee engagement and giving back to the communities in which we live.
We seek employees who share our commitment to hard work, ingenuity and doing what it takes to best serve our customers. Our priorities are to provide competitive compensation and benefits packages, support the ongoing personal and professional development of our employees and provide a safe and inclusive work environment.
We also prioritize the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion through initiatives undertaken to increase diversity (through recruitment and hiring), equity (through investments in targeted development programs and flexible work options) and inclusion (through employee resource groups and inclusive management). 
As part of our oversight with respect to our human capital resources, our Board of Directors periodically receives reports from management regarding the status of our Strategic People and Culture Plan, which focuses on three critical themes: 
•Building Growth Capabilities - through supporting and enabling our Growth Teams to drive profitable growth; 
•Building Leadership - through improving manager effectiveness and promoting internal talent for critical roles; and 
•Building Belonging - through improved engagement survey results and diversity representation in people leadership roles.
Our compensation programs are market-driven and performance-based, allowing us to recognize and reward employees who display the values and leadership practices we embrace. In addition to offering competitive compensation packages (including salary, incentive bonus and stock compensation), we also provide a benefits package that provides employees with options in managing their well-being (including health insurance, paid time off, an employee assistance program, paid parental leave and retirement savings plans).
We offer a work environment with opportunities for personal development, challenges, career growth and recognition. Through our development and career growth programs, employees have opportunities to enhance skills, develop competencies and pursue career goals. 
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, titanium, nickel and petroleum-based products. Where appropriate, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements or fixed-cost contracts to lower the overall cost of raw materials. In addition, due to our diverse product and service offering, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the raw materials needed in our operations. However, we are not dependent on any one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Lastly, we continue to centralize certain aspects of supply chain management in an effort to ensure adequate materials are available for production at low cost. For more information, please refer to “Risk Factors - The price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.”
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors are diverse, ranging from large multi-national to regional and local companies. Our principal global competitors include Alfa Laval AB, Enerpac Tool Group Corp., GEA Group AG, IDEX Corporation, Ingersoll Rand Inc., and Tetra Pak International S.A. We do not have any one competitor with all the same product offerings, nor do we have any one competitor which serves all the same end markets. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends on a variety of factors including breadth of product offering, product quality, engineering strength, brand reputation, lead times, global capabilities, service capabilities and cost. As many of our products are sold through distributors and independent representatives, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. 
Backlog
Information with respect to the backlog of the Company's segments at December 31, 2021 is presented in “MD&A - Results of Reportable Segments.”
Environmental Matters
See "MD&A - Other Matters - Contingent Liabilities and Other Matters," "MD&A - Other Matters - Potential Impacts From Climate Change," "Risk Factors - We are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters" and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters. 
Executive Officers 
See Part III, Item 10 of this report for information about our executive officers. 
Other Matters 
No customer or group of customers that, to our knowledge, are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
Our businesses maintain sufficient levels of working capital to support customer requirements, particularly inventory. We believe our businesses' sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. 
The financial results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. In aggregate, our businesses tend to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year. Additionally, timing of revenue recognition on large Nutrition and Health systems projects and large Precision Solutions original equipment orders may cause significant fluctuations in financial performance from period to period.
