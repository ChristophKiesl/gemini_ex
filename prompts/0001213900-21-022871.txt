Overview
 
Corporate History and Structure
 
Jialijia Group Corporation Limited, formerly known as Rizzen, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 21, 2015. On May 16, 2018, our Articles of Incorporation were amended to change our name to Jialijia Group Corporation Limited and increase the number of authorized shares the corporation from 75,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.
 
Effective as of December 15, 2018, the Company appointed: (i) Mr. Dongzhi Zhang as the Chairman of the Board; (ii) Mr. Jiannan Wu as the Company’s General Manager and Director; and (iii) Ms. Weixia Hu as the Company’s Chinese Region Chief Representative. Ms. Na Jin is our CEO, CFO, Secretary and a director. 
 
Jialijia Group Corporation Limited, formerly known as Rizzen, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 21, 2015 and has been inactive since our change in control on December 30, 2016. Following our change,
 
On July 10, 2019, the Company entered into a share purchase/exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Huazhongyun Group Co., Limited (“Huazhongyun,” formerly known as “JLJ Group Corporation Limited”), a company formed under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Na Jin, the sole shareholder of Huazhongyun and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Na Jin, through Huazhongyun, owned 6,000,000 shares (the “Company Shares”) of the Company, which represented approximately 82% of the shares of the Company’s common stock, issued and outstanding, par value $0.001 per share, as of the date of execution of the Share Exchange Agreement. Na Jin owned an aggregate of 10,000 ordinary shares of Huazhongyun (“Huazhongyun Shares”), which constituted all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Huazhongyun. On the date of execution of the Share Exchange Agreement, Huazhongyun owned all of the equity interests in Jialijia Jixiang Investment (Changzhou) Co., Ltd. (“WFOE”), a wholly-foreign owned entity formed under the laws of China, which in turn held seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding equity interest in Rucheng Wenchuan Gas Co., Ltd. (the “Rucheng Wenchuan”), a company formed under the laws of China.
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, on August 29, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), Na Jin sold and transferred all of the Huazhongyun Shares to the Company in exchange for all of the Company Shares and the Company received all of the outstanding Huazhongyun Shares. As a result, on the Closing Date, Na Jin directly owned Company Shares representing approximately 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, Huazhongyun became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company owned 70% of the outstanding equity interest in Rucheng Wenchuan through Huazhongyun and WFOE.
 
From July 22, 2019 to July 29, 2019, the Company entered into a securities subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with fifty-four (54) investors (the “Investors”) who reside outside the United States where the Investors purchased an aggregate of 3,011,483 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a price of $0.03 per share. Pursuant to each of the Subscription Agreements, the Company issued its shares of common stock to each Investor in the respective amounts as set forth in the Subscription Agreement and received the funds in the corresponding amounts as set forth therein. In addition, on April 20, 2019, Ms. Na Jin, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, entered into a Subscription Agreement to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.01 per share, for a total purchase price of $10,000, which purchase was consummated on July 24, 2019.
 
As a result of the consummation of the above merger on August 29, 2019, we entered into the business of producing and selling gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, for industrial and medical purposes in the PRC. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic materially and adversely affected economic conditions and our operating results. As a result, we were unable to obtain the financing necessary to pursue this business.

Effective July 15, 2020, we engaged in a one for twenty reverse stock split of our common stock whereby each twenty shares of common stock were reduced into one share of common stock with fractional shares rounded to one whole share. All descriptions of securities issuances occurring prior to such reverse stock split are provided on a pre-reverse basis.
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company.
 
Our principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. We are in active discussions with an operating company for a potential business combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate such an acquisition or that following such acquisition we will be eligible to trade on a national securities exchange, or be quoted on the Over-the-Counter.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

● | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other relevant factors.
--+------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
