Company Overview
 
Banjo & Matilda was founded by Australian born creative director Belynda Storelli Macpherson in 2009, after an extensive career in publicity, fashion publishing and marketing. Prior companies where Belynda worked include Grazia, Harpers Bazaar and Maddison fashion magazines, major film studios including Warner Brothers, Universal Studios and Columbia Tri-Star Pictures; and, the Australian tourism industry marketing body Tourism Australia. Belynda also founded her own publicity firm “Global Artist” which she successfully sold to a larger group in 2002.
 
Belynda identified the emerging casualization of the luxury fashion market and combined her passion for cashmere, the Australian beach lifestyle and frustration over the lack of accessible quality cashmere to create a new, more relevant luxury brand. One that was born on line as a direct to consumer e-commerce model thereby eliminating the unnecessary margin's that department and specialty stores take, enabling the brand to focus on a luxury quality product, but without inflated luxury prices. The brands heritage centered on its easy luxury lifestyle of beach, travel, and health and wellness which Australia is best known for has been a key driver in the brands growing popularity and the position it has secured in the market. 
 
General Market issues; Market opportunity
 
Total global apparel sales reached $1.2T+ in 2015, with total sales expected to grow at 5-6%+ over the next 5 years. The traditional apparel market sales model is experiencing significant challenges due to the structural issues physical store retailers face. Increasing competition and market share taken by e-commerce retailers, overbuilt expensive retail store networks, falling foot traffic, and greater competition and discounting has meant many retailers margins are decreasing, at the same time gross physical store sales are static or declining. There are an increasing number of physical retailers experiencing declining profitability and business failure mostly affected by these issues. 
 
These issues are also negatively impacting traditional apparel and lifestyle brands and not just retailers. Traditional brands rely heavily on the traditional wholesale-to-retail sales model. The cost of higher returns from major retailers who are struggling to sell through product, discounts demanded by retailers to suppliers and brands, and higher bad debts as a result of smaller retailers failing, is driving decreased profitability and failure.
 
This market is ripe for disruption. E-commerce direct-to-consumer (or vertical) brands can now provide a higher quality product at a lower price than traditional brands by avoiding the traditional retail mark-up taken by department and specialty stores. This proposition provides a significant consumer benefit. Combine the price-to-quality product advantage with sophisticated digital marketing efficiently acquiring and re-engaging customers via online marketing, digitally media rich story-telling, social media and technology, is driving a rapid expansion of the digital vertical brands. 
 
Sales via e-commerce for apparel, luxury and well-being related goods is now the fastest growing sales channel for these consumer segments. Purchasing online has now reached a critical mass which should enable brands like Banjo & Matilda to build a successful large scale direct-to-consumer e-commerce centric business. 
 
Banjo & Matilda is known as a modern luxury brand specializing in luxury quality casual cashmere knitwear which retails for 1/2 to 1/3rd of the price of a traditional luxury brand of similar quality. It has an authentic brand heritage founded in Australia in 2009, encapsulating the iconic surf, sand, sun and healthy living lifestyle that Australia has become known for. Streamlining the production process by partnering with cashmere yarn producers in inner Mongolia (where 98% of the world’s cashmere originates), and manufacturing in specialist factories with deep knitting expertise, the Company sells directly to customers online, avoiding the typical costs of wholesale/retailer mark-up -- conveniently delivering a luxury quality product at an accessible price point.
 
Our Products
 
Banjo & Matilda offers a comprehensive line of luxury women's cashmere knitwear including sweaters and pants, and accessories such as cashmere scarves, slippers, eye-masks and travel blankets. Banjo & Matilda also collaborates with high profile artists and celebrities to create exclusive limited edition pieces. In 2015, the Company collaborated with Gwyneth Paltrow and her successful lifestyle blog GOOP, with prior collaborations including singer Bryan Adams, prominent businesswoman, television host, model and actress Elle Macpherson, British artist Tracey Emin and Australian singer/songwriter, model and actress Natalie Imbruglia. The Company is planning to expand its product lines to include broader lifestyle offering of apparel items, home products, menswear, children's apparel, and gifts.

Product Manufacturing
 
Banjo & Matilda use third party contract manufacturers rather than owning operating low margin manufacturing facilities itself. All yarns and fabrics are sourced from reputable suppliers. Materials used are typically the highest grade that can be sourced. Banjo & Matilda works with various manufacturers at any one time, with two manufacturers each accounting for 10% or more of annual manufacturing costs; however, the Company believes that all of its manufacturers are replaceable without adversely affecting its business. Our manufacturers provide us with the speed to market necessary to respond quickly to changing trends and increased demand. While we believe that we have a good relationship with our manufacturers, we do not have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products pursuant to a long-term contract. We regularly secure and test new manufacturing partners and believe that the services of additional, or other, manufacturers and/or suppliers of our fabrics are available.
Product Distribution
 
The Company was founded as an e-commerce only direct to consumer model – distribution only online via its e-commerce store www.banjoandmatilda.com. In 2012 we opened a “guide store” in Sydney Australia. In 2013 we embarked on a strategic wholesale program to assist driving brand awareness and revenue growth in the Northern Hemisphere markets. Through the 2015 period in conjunction with our relocation to the US, we scaled the wholesale business and operations reaching 200+ retail outlets, stocked in major department stores and key independent boutiques. As a result of the increased overheads and falling gross margins from wholesale sales due to the shifts and issues occurring in the physical retail landscape, the Company withdrew from the wholesale distribution channel in January 2016 to focus on its core e-commerce business model.
Competition
 
There is meaningful competition in the luxury apparel industry with emphasis on the brand image and recognition as well as product quality, style, and distribution. Banjo & Matilda successfully competes thanks to a premium and unique brand, unique designs, and attainable price points previously not available in the luxury product sector. This enables the brand to acquire and keep customers which would not typically purchase traditional luxury products due to the much higher price points. There are limited entrants into the market with similar cashmere focused e-commerce offerings which directly compete in terms of product quality and price point.
Intellectual Property
 
Banjo & Matilda has registered trademarks in Australia and the USA. We believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of all of our products in Australia, the United States, and Europe (and in the other countries in which our products are currently or intended to be either sold or manufactured).
