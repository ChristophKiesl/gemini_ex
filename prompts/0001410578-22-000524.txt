ITEM 1.BUSINESS
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Global Consumer Acquisition Corp.
Introduction
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation formed on December 28, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (our “initial business combination” or “ business combination”).
If GACQ does not consummate the Business Combination and fails to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of its initial public offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the initial public offering if GACQ extends the period of time to consummate a business combination for two times, as described in more detail in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on June 10, 2021), then, pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, GACQ will be required to dissolve and liquidate as soon as reasonably practicable, unless GACQ seeks stockholder approval to amend GACQ’s certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which an initial business combination may be consummated.
Offering Proceeds Held in Trust
On June 11, 2021, GACQ consummated the IPO of 17,000,000 units (the “Public Units”) at $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $170,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, GACQ consummated the sale of 431,510 units (the “Private Units”) in a private placement transaction with Global Consumer Acquisition LLC, GACQ’s sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $4,315,100.
Subsequently, on June 14, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Public Units occurred (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) on June 16, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by GACQ of 1,263,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $12,630,000. On June 16, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, GACQ consummated the private sale of an additional 22,102 Private Units, generating gross proceeds of $221,020. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
On June 16, 2021, the underwriters canceled the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option, GACQ canceled an aggregate of 321,750 shares of common stock issued to its sponsor prior to its initial public offering and Private Placement.
After deducting the underwriting discounts, offering expenses and commissions from the initial public offering and the sale of the Private Units, a total of $183,543,150 of the net proceeds from the initial public and the sale of the Private Units was deposited into GACQ’s trust account (the “Trust Account”), which is invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by use, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account.
Effecting a Business Combination
On December 13, 2021, GACQ entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Luminex SPA”) with CLP Luminex Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Luminex Seller”), and Luminex Home Décor & Fragrance Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Luminex”). Pursuant to the terms of the Luminex SPA, a business combination between Global Consumer and Luminex will be effected by the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Luminex from Luminex Seller (the “Luminex Stock Acquisition”). Further, on December 13, 2021, Global Consumer entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “GP Global SPA”) by and among Global Consumer, TGP Trading FZCO, a freezone company with limited liability organized in Dubai Airport Free Zone, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“GP Global Seller”), and GP Global Limited, an offshore company with limited liability organized in Jebel Ali Free Zone, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“GP Global”). Pursuant to the terms of the GP Global SPA, a business combination between Global Consumer and GP Global will be effected by the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding 

2



capital shares of GP Global from GP Global Seller (the “GP Global Stock Acquisition”). Due to his position as the sole owner of GP Global Seller, which is the 100% owner of GP Global, Mr. Gautham Pai, Co-Chairman of the board of GACQ and a member of the Sponsor, recused himself from both the board discussion and the board vote regarding the GP Global Business Combination. After careful consideration, the disinterested members of the board of directors of GACQ have unanimously approved and adopted the GP Global SPA and the transactions contemplated therein. All members of the board of directors of GACQ unanimously approved and adopted the Luminex SPA and the transactions contemplated therein. The consummation of the Luminex Stock Acquisition is not conditioned on the consummation of the GP Global Stock Acquisition. However, the GP Global Stock Acquisition is conditioned on the consummation of the Luminex Stock Acquisition.
The Business Combination is subject to the approval of the GACQ’s stockholders as well as other closing conditions. If GACQ does not consummate the Business Combination and fails to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of its initial public offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the initial public offering if GACQ extends the period of time to consummate a business combination for two times, as described in more detail in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on June 10, 2021), then, pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, GACQ will be required to dissolve and liquidate as soon as reasonably practicable, unless GACQ seeks stockholder approval to amend GACQ’s certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which an initial business combination may be consummated.
Redemption Rights for Holders of the Public Shares
Pursuant to GACQ’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, holders of the public shares will be entitled to redeem their public shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account (including interest earned on the pro rata portion of the Trust Account, net of taxes payable), currently anticipated to be no less than approximately $10.05 per share of GACQ Common Stock. GACQ’s initial stockholders do not have redemption rights with respect to any shares of GACQ Common Stock owned by them, directly or indirectly.
Automatic Dissolution and Subsequent Liquidation of the Trust Account if No Business Combination
If GACQ does not consummate the Business Combination and fails to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of its initial public offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the initial public offering if GACQ extends the period of time to consummate a business combination for two times, as described in more detail in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on June 10, 2021), then, pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, GACQ will be required to dissolve and liquidate as soon as reasonably practicable, unless GACQ seeks stockholder approval to amend GACQ’s certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which an initial business combination may be consummated. As a result, this has the same effect as if GACQ had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under Delaware law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from the GACQ’s stockholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. If GACQ is unable to consummate the Business Combination and fails to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of its initial public offering (or up to 18 months, as applicable), it will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of GACQ’s outstanding public shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account upon the consummation of the Business Combination (including interest earned on the pro rata portion of the Trust Account, net of taxes payable) and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. In the event of its dissolution and liquidation, the GACQ Warrants will expire and will be worthless.
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of GACQ’s creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of its public stockholders. GACQ cannot guarantee that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.05. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, GACQ’s plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against it to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before GACQ makes any distribution of its remaining assets to its stockholders. While GACQ intends to pay such amounts, if any, GACQ cannot guarantee that it will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although GACQ will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which GACQ does business execute agreements with it waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of GACQ’s public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against GACQ’s assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, GACQ’s management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to it than any alternative.

In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with GACQ and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. GACQ’s sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to GACQ if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to GACQ, or a prospective target business with which GACQ has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.05 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under GACQ’s indemnity of the underwriters of GACQ’s initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then GACQ’s sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. GACQ has not independently verified whether GACQ’s sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that its sponsor’s only assets are securities of GACQ. GACQ has not asked its sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, GACQ cannot guarantee that its sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for GACQ’s initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.05 per public share. In such event, GACQ may not be able to complete its initial business combination, and GACQ’s stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their public shares. None of GACQ’s officers will indemnify GACQ for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.05 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and GACQ’s sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, GACQ’s independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against GACQ’s sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While GACQ expects that its independent directors would take legal action on its behalf against its sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to GACQ, it is possible that GACQ’s independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. GACQ has not asked its sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and GACQ cannot guarantee that its sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, GACQ cannot guarantee that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.05 per public share.
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of GACQ’s trust account distributed to its public stockholders upon the redemption of its public shares in the event GACQ does not complete its business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of its initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of GACQ’s trust account distributed to its public stockholders upon the redemption of its public shares in the event GACQ do not complete its business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of GACQ’s initial public offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If GACQ is unable to complete its business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of its initial public offering, GACQ will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to GACQ to pay its taxes (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of GACQ’s remaining stockholders and their board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to GACQ’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is GACQ’s intention to redeem its public shares as soon as reasonably possible following its 18th month and, therefore, GACQ does not 

4



intend to comply with those procedures. As such, GACQ’s stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of its stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because GACQ does not comply with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires GACQ to adopt a plan, based on facts known to GACQ at such time that will provide for its payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against it within the subsequent 10 years. However, because GACQ is a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and its operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from its vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. Pursuant to the obligation contained in GACQ’s underwriting agreement dated June 8, 2021, GACQ required that all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which it does business execute agreements with it waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against GACQ are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, GACQ’s sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.05 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under GACQ’s indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, GACQ’s sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
If GACQ files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against it that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in GACQ’s bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of its stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, GACQ cannot guarantee that it will be able to return $10.05 per share to its public stockholders. Additionally, if GACQ files a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against GACQ that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by GACQ’s stockholders. Furthermore, GACQ’s board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to its creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and GACQ to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. GACQ cannot guarantee that claims will not be brought against it for these reasons.
GACQ’s public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of its public shares if GACQ does not complete its business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of its initial public offering, subject to applicable law, (ii) (a) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its public shares if GACQ has not consummated an initial business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of GACQ’s initial public offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) GACQ’s completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in the final prospectus GACQ filed with the SEC on June 10, 2021. In no other circumstances will a stockholder has any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
Each of GACQ’s initial stockholders has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of the Trust Account or other assets with respect to any shares of GACQ common stock they hold.
Employees
GACQ currently has one officer, Mr. Ajila, who serves as its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ajila is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to GACQ’s matters but he intends to devote as much of their time as he deems necessary to GACQ’s affairs until it has consummated the Business Combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected and the stage of the Business Combination process GACQ is in. GACQ does not have any other employees.

Facilities
GACQ’s executive offices are located at 1926 Rand Ridge Court, Marietta, GA 30062 and its telephone number is (404) 939-9419. The cost for GACQ’s use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee it pays to ARC Group Limited, its financial advisor, for office space, administrative and support services. GACQ considers its current office space adequate for its current operations.
Legal Proceedings
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against GACQ or any members of its management team in their capacity as such.
GACQ has entered into the following agreements to acquire two business combination target companies for the purpose of consummating its initial business combination. Both business combination target companies are in the home decor and fragrance products industry. All capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the respective agreements.
On December 13, 2021, GACQ entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Luminex SPA”) with CLP Luminex Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Luminex Seller”), and Luminex Home Décor & Fragrance Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Luminex”). Pursuant to the terms of the Luminex SPA, a business combination between Global Consumer and Luminex will be effected by the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Luminex from Luminex Seller (the “Luminex Stock Acquisition”). Further, on December 13, 2021, Global Consumer entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “GP Global SPA”) by and among Global Consumer, TGP Trading FZCO, a freezone company with limited liability organized in Dubai Airport Free Zone, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“GP Global Seller”), and GP Global Limited, an offshore company with limited liability organized in Jebel Ali Free Zone, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“GP Global”). Pursuant to the terms of the GP Global SPA, a business combination between Global Consumer and GP Global will be effected by the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital shares of GP Global from GP Global Seller (the “GP Global Stock Acquisition”). Due to his position as the sole owner of GP Global Seller, which is the 100% owner of GP Global, Mr. Gautham Pai, Co-Chairman of the board of GACQ and a member of the Sponsor, recused himself from both the board discussion and the board vote regarding the GP Global Business Combination. After careful consideration, the disinterested members of the board of directors of GACQ have unanimously approved and adopted the GP Global SPA and the transactions contemplated therein. All members of the board of directors of GACQ unanimously approved and adopted the Luminex SPA and the transactions contemplated therein. The consummation of the Luminex Stock Acquisition is not conditioned on the consummation of the GP Global Stock Acquisition. However, the GP Global Stock Acquisition is conditioned on the consummation of the Luminex Stock Acquisition.
Purchaser Support Agreement
In connection with the execution of the Luminex SPA, certain stockholders of Global Consumer entered into a support agreement (the “Purchaser Support Agreement”) pursuant to which the stockholders of Global Consumer that are parties to the Purchaser Support Agreement have agreed to vote all shares of common stock of Global Consumer beneficially owned by them in favor of the Luminex SPA and related transactions.
