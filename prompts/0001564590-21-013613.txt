Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a medical device company dedicated to improving the quality of life of people with hearing loss. We developed the Eargo solution to create a hearing aid that consumers actually want to use. Our innovative product and go-to-market approach address the major challenges of traditional hearing aid adoption, including social stigma, accessibility and cost. We believe our Eargo hearing aids are the first and only virtually invisible, rechargeable, completely-in-canal, FDA-regulated, exempt Class I and Class II devices for the treatment of hearing loss. Our rapid pace of innovation is enabled by our deep industry and technical expertise across mechanical engineering, product design, audio processing, clinical and hearing science, consumer electronics and embedded software design, and is supported by our strategic intellectual property portfolio. Our differentiated, consumer-first approach empowers consumers to take control of their hearing by improving accessibility, with personalized, high-quality telecare-based hearing support from licensed hearing professionals. We believe that our differentiated hearing aids, consumer-oriented approach and strong brand have fueled the rapid adoption of our products and high customer satisfaction, as evidenced by over 60 thousand Eargo hearing aid systems sold, net of returns, as of December 31, 2020. We believe this represents the beginning of our penetration into a large, growing and underserved market of people with hearing loss, which we estimate included approximately 43 million adults in the United States and more than 465 million adults globally in 2019.
 Hearing loss is a natural consequence of aging and has a significant impact on quality of life. Globally, hearing loss is one of the most prevalent health conditions, and it is the third most common medical condition in the United States—more prevalent than both diabetes and cancer. As demographic trends shift and people continue to live longer, we expect that the proportion of the population with hearing loss will continue to rise, further expanding this already large market.
 We estimate that in 2019, 37 million individuals over the age of 50 in the United States had mild to moderate hearing loss. Of these 37 million, our initial marketing efforts are focused on individuals with annual incomes above the median household national average. We estimate that this group consisted of approximately 14 million people and represented an initial target market of over $30 billion in 2019.
 Age-related hearing loss in the United States is predominantly addressed by the use of FDA-regulated hearing aids. Despite the significant individual and societal impact of hearing loss, we estimate only approximately 27% of the estimated approximately 43 million adults with hearing loss in the United States in 2019 owned a hearing aid. We believe the low adoption and underserved nature of this market is a direct result of the limitations of and stigma associated with traditional hearing aids and the cumbersome manner in which they are sold.
 Hearing aids are traditionally distributed through a business-to-business model in which hearing aid manufacturers rely on a fragmented network of independent hearing clinics to sell their devices to consumers. Purchasing a hearing aid through a clinic can be a lengthy, inconvenient and disempowering process that generally requires a series of in-clinic appointments with a licensed hearing professional for assessment, fitting, programming, ongoing adjustments and maintenance. We believe the separation of the manufacturer from the consumer is not necessary, adds an incremental layer of cost and has contributed to the historical lack of innovation in this market, resulting in products that fail to meet consumer needs.
 Designing hearing aids that offer high quality audio performance in a virtually invisible and comfortable form factor that address the needs of consumers presents significant engineering challenges. These challenges have historically been difficult to reconcile in a single device, resulting in the traditional landscape of products that reflect trade-offs between functionality, comfort, visibility and ease of use. Behind-the-ear devices represented approximately 88% of hearing aids dispensed in the United States in 2019 but have a highly visible form factor that contributes to the stigma of hearing loss and limits their adoption. The remaining approximately 12% of hearing aids dispensed in 2019 were in-the-ear devices that are less visible but can occlude or obstruct the ear canal causing discomfort. Additionally, in-the-ear devices require customization and generally require batteries that need to be replaced, making them expensive and cumbersome to use.

The COVID-19 pandemic thus far has largely resulted in favorable trends for our business. We believe that shelter-in-place restrictions and increased reluctance of consumers to be exposed to the virus, particularly among older individuals that comprise a majority of the population needing hearing aids, have increased the attractiveness to consumers of our hearing solution and our vertically integrated telecare model. We believe our model can help consumers decrease their risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 by avoiding multiple trips to hearing aid clinics and close proximity to audiologists and other individuals at such clinics, which are part of the traditional hearing aid sales model. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 depends on the duration and severity of the pandemic, which is difficult to assess or predict. While we have experienced growth in our sales volume during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot be certain whether we will maintain the current level of demand for our hearing aids, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 could be substantially different than what we have experienced to date.
 We believe our hearing aids and consumer-centric approach, which we refer to collectively as our Eargo solution, address many of the drawbacks of the traditional hearing aid market. The primary benefits of our solution include the following:
  
• | Virtually invisible: Our hearing aids fit completely in the ear canal and are virtually invisible, allowing our customers to avoid the stigma associated with visible hearing aids.

 Overview of hearing loss
 Globally, hearing loss impacted more than 465 million people in 2019. In the United States, we estimate there were approximately 43 million adults with hearing loss in 2019, making it the third most common medical condition and more prevalent than both diabetes and cancer. 
 As demonstrated below, hearing loss increases with age and reflects the natural and gradual progression of hearing deterioration that occurs in most people as they age. In the United States, we estimate approximately 34% of people over the age of 50 and nearly two-thirds of people over the age of 70 experienced difficulty hearing in 2019. As demographic trends shift and people live longer, we expect that the proportion of the population with hearing loss will continue to rise.

Hearing loss may be characterized as mild, moderate, severe or profound, depending on how loud sounds need to be for an individual to hear. In the United States, approximately 6% of the hearing impaired population is characterized as having severe or profound hearing loss, while the moderate and mild segments represent approximately 28% and 66% of this population, respectively.
 Hearing loss can significantly impact quality of life. Hearing loss can make it more difficult to work or interact with family and friends, leading to feelings of isolation, depression and increased stress. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, hearing loss has been linked to accelerated cognitive decline. The World Health Organization estimates that unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of approximately $750 billion. As global populations become older, we believe the burden of hearing loss will continue to rise.

Traditional alternatives for the treatment of hearing loss
 Traditional product landscape
 Hearing loss in the United States is typically addressed by the use of FDA-regulated hearing aids. To be functional for daily use, hearing aids must be engineered with a form factor that is portable, long-lasting, comfortable and discreet. These challenges have historically been difficult to reconcile in a single device, resulting in the traditional landscape of products that reflect trade-offs between functionality, comfort, visibility and ease of use. Behind-the-ear devices represent approximately 88% of hearing aids dispensed in the United States in 2019 but have a highly visible form factor that contributes to the stigma of hearing loss and limits their adoption. The remaining approximately 12% of hearing aids dispensed in 2019 are in-the-ear devices that are less visible but can occlude or obstruct the ear canal, causing discomfort. Generally, in-the-ear devices are also not rechargeable and require batteries that need to be replaced, making them cumbersome to use. Due in part to these limitations, hearing aids are significantly underutilized in the hearing-impaired population. In 2019, of the estimated approximately 43 million adults with hearing loss in the United States, only approximately 27% owned a hearing aid.
 The table below illustrates the primary features of traditional hearing aids.
 

 
* | Represents estimated average retail costs per pair of hearing aids sold through traditional channels in the United States. Hearing aids with custom features that reduce device visibility or improve comfort can retail for significantly more than the industry average
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to FDA-regulated hearing aids, consumers can purchase personal sound amplification products, or PSAPs. PSAPs are primarily sound amplification devices that lack the audio quality, noise reduction and feedback cancellation technology of FDA-regulated hearing aids. While PSAPs are broadly available in consumer electronics stores and online at relatively affordable price points, the FDA does not currently recognize them as a treatment for hearing loss, instead describing PSAPs as “devices that increase environmental sounds for non-hearing impaired consumers.” The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, created a new category of over-the-counter, or OTC, hearing aids that are intended to be available without the involvement of a licensed practitioner, and it is possible that some PSAPs could become OTC hearing aids under the new framework if they satisfy applicable requirements. Despite the deadline in FDARA for the FDA to issue proposed regulations to implement the OTC hearing aid pathway by August 18, 2020, the FDA has not yet issued a notice of proposed rulemaking or indicated how it will implement this pathway.
 Traditional sales and distribution channel
 Hearing aids have traditionally been sold through a business-to-business model in which hearing aid manufacturers rely on a fragmented network of independent hearing clinics to sell their devices to consumers. Purchasing a hearing aid through a clinic generally requires a series of appointments with a licensed hearing professional for assessment, fitting, programming and ongoing adjustments. In 2018, there were approximately 18,800 licensed hearing professionals in the United States. We believe the separation of the manufacturer from the

consumer is not necessary, adds an incremental layer of cost and has contributed to the historical lack of innovation in this market, resulting in products that fail to meet consumer needs.
 Traditional consumer journey
 Market research indicates that approximately six to seven years pass between the time that the average hearing aid user in the United States first acknowledges their hearing loss and when they first purchase a hearing aid. Once consumers decide to seek help, they are often referred by an ear-nose-throat physician or general practitioner to a licensed hearing care professional. The licensed hearing care professional performs a hearing test, recommends a hearing device and then performs fitting procedures which often require multiple visits.
 Hearing aids are typically sold as a part of a bundled package that includes the device itself, the audiology exam and related services. Further, there is limited transparency at the consumer level, and the end-user price generally includes the overhead cost and profit margin for the hearing clinic in addition to the cost of the device and audiology services.
 Following purchase, traditional hearing aids typically require programming and adjustments by the licensed hearing care professional, resulting in additional in-person follow-up visits. Throughout this lengthy process, which can take weeks or even months, the consumer is reliant on the licensed hearing care professional for education and support. Despite the high touch nature of the selling process and extensive level of customization, hearing aids are often returned due to issues related to comfort, fit, functionality and aesthetics.
 Limitations of traditional alternatives for the treatment of hearing loss
 We believe the limitations of traditional hearing aids and the manner in which they are sold today are the primary reasons that approximately 73% of the estimated approximately 43 million adults in the United States in 2019 with hearing loss did not own a hearing aid. These limitations include the following:
 Product limitations
  
• | Visible, aesthetically unattractive devices: Because the behind the ear form factor generally enables the device to amplify sound without occluding the ear canal, approximately 88% of hearing aids dispensed in 2019 were visible behind-the-ear devices. While in-the-ear and in-the-canal devices are designed to be less obvious, the device is still noticeable. We believe that a significant portion of individuals with hearing loss find the idea of wearing visible hearing aids stigmatizing. According to the Northstar Survey, a market survey of 2,200 adults over the age of 45 in the United States commissioned by us and conducted by NORTHSTAR Research Partners (USA) LLC in March and September 2019, nearly 70% of U.S. adults over 45 viewed invisibility as extremely or very important.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Occlusion causing discomfort for the wearer: Devices located in the ear canal can address the challenge of visibility; however, they either fully or partially block the ear canal. This occlusion causes physical discomfort and poor sound quality for the wearer. The Northstar Survey indicated that over 90% of existing and prospective hearing aid users view comfort and sound quality as extremely or very important. We believe that this helps explain why only approximately 12% of hearing aids dispensed in 2019 were in-the-ear or completely-in-canal devices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Battery changing hassle: Traditional hearing aids can be frustrating to use, with tiny batteries and battery doors, screws and buttons that are difficult to manipulate, especially for older individuals. According to the Northstar Survey, over 80% of individuals who have recently experienced hearing difficulty cited the ability to recharge a hearing aid as extremely or very important.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Channel limitations
  
• | Disempowering consumer experience: We believe the traditional industry business model does not lend itself to consumer awareness, and that consumers may feel like patients with limited autonomy in the process, as opposed to empowered consumers making a purchasing decision. Hearing clinics exercise a

fair degree of influence over product availability, such that consumers may not be presented with a full range of product choices or be informed about the benefits and drawbacks of each product. In fact, most of hearing aid users do not know the brand name of their device.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconvenient, cumbersome process: The traditional business-to-business channel has faced limited competition and disruption, and there has been little investment in the consumer experience. The entire process from obtaining a hearing aid through programming and adjustments is lengthy and can take multiple weeks and up to several months of in-person hearing clinic visits. This process is cumbersome and ultimately results in limited consumer satisfaction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High cost: The cost of traditional hearing aids reflects the multi-layer distribution channel through which they are sold. The consumer price includes the cost of the device itself and a profit margin for the manufacturer as well as the overhead cost and profit margin for the hearing clinic. The average retail cost of a pair of hearing aids sold through traditional channels in the United States is estimated to be $4,600, making them approximately twice the average price of our hearing aids. Further, hearing aids with custom features that reduce device visibility or improve comfort can retail for significantly more than the industry average. In addition, approximately 87% of the Northstar Survey respondents in September 2019 indicated that price was extremely or very important.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | COVID-19 barriers: We believe the recent emergence of COVID-19 has made the process of obtaining a hearing aid through traditional channels more cumbersome given the additional precautions hearing clinics and consumers have taken as a result of COVID-19, as well as shelter-in-place and other government mandates. The number of hearing aid units sold through traditional channels in the United States decreased approximately 59% year-over-year during the second quarter of 2020, according to statistics generated by Hearing Industries Association. According to a survey conducted by The Hearing Review in May 2020, while approximately 75% of audiology clinics in the United States and Canada were accepting patient visits as of May 2020, most were experiencing significant revenue declines compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. Despite this, the survey found that only 8% of clinics planned to use telecare methods to acquire new patients.

The Eargo solution
 We are passionate about helping people hear better. We are on a mission to change the way the world thinks about hearing loss.
 Since our inception, our founding principle has been to dramatically improve the consumer experience at every step of the hearing care journey. Our products, customer support and marketing messaging are a direct result of that passion. We believe our model can shift the paradigm in the treatment of hearing loss for the ultimate benefit of consumers.
 Our products
 Our Eargo hearing aids combine proprietary technology, engineering know-how and design expertise to offer high-quality performance in an in-the-canal form factor that makes them virtually invisible. Our in-the-canal devices feature high quality audio, are designed to provide up to 16 hours of battery life and have proprietary Flexi Fibers or Flexi Palms, which are designed to enable the unit to comfortably “float” in the ear canal allowing air and sound to pass freely around them. Eargo hearing aids are designed for ease of use and maintenance and to fit a majority of the population, and are rechargeable. In addition, Eargo hearing aids are highly customizable, allowing our users to cycle through four different sound profiles, which include different features such as amplification and noise levels while on-the-go to accommodate different ambient noise environments. We currently offer three versions of our hearing aids, the Eargo Max, the Eargo Neo and the Eargo Neo HiFi, at three different price points to provide customers with choices on cost and functionality. Our hearing aids also come with a portable charging case, and the Eargo Neo and Eargo Neo HiFi offer connectivity via a Bluetooth-enabled charging case and the Eargo mobile app.

Our business model and consumer journey
 We employ a differentiated, consumer-first business model to empower the consumer and improve the accessibility and affordability of high-quality hearing aids. We currently market and sell our hearing aids directly to consumers with a personalized approach that we believe helps motivate them to take action and then guides them along their hearing journey.
 We engage consumers through a mix of digital and traditional marketing that is designed to appeal to prospective customers on a personal level and build our brand. Our data-driven approach to reaching consumers has allowed us to identify and target key demographics and purchasing behaviors of our most relevant audience, and we constantly refine our approach to most efficiently reach this audience. Our empowering messaging and sophisticated marketing strategy have helped contribute to over 60 thousand hearing aids sold, net of returns, as of December 31, 2020.
 In addition to providing information about our products, we encourage prospective customers to learn about their hearing condition and provide free educational resources to help them make informed decisions. While a hearing test is not necessary to purchase an Eargo hearing aid, we offer an online, do-it-yourself hearing screen for prospective customers who are interested in an assessment. We believe this is an empowering experiential journey for the consumer as they are able to learn at their own pace and comfort.
 Once a potential customer has expressed interest in our Eargo solution, by completing a form or otherwise contacting us, one of our sales consultants will contact them directly. Our sales consultants are highly trained inside salespeople who collaborate with the consumer on how best to address their hearing loss challenges and determine whether the Eargo hearing solution is appropriate for them.
 11

Customers are able to complete their purchase over the phone with their sales consultant or directly on our website, without the need to navigate multiple visits to the hearing clinic for tests and fittings. Importantly, potential customers are not required to have a hearing test to order the Eargo hearing solution, which simplifies the purchasing experience and improves the accessibility of hearing aids relative to the traditional hearing clinic channel. In addition, Eargo provides insurance claims processing for consumers, eliminating in most cases the need for consumers to interface with their insurance providers. Further, we offer a 45-day trial period.
 We offer three products, the Eargo Max, Eargo Neo and the Eargo Neo HiFi, which range in price from $1,850 to $2,950, and we provide consumers with the option to utilize insurance coverage, pay the full cost up-front or enroll in a convenient, third-party monthly financing program that makes our products even more accessible. The Eargo hearing solution is then shipped and arrives in less than three business days on average.
 Once a customer makes their purchase they are assigned to one of our licensed hearing professionals, who provides complimentary, convenient clinical support by phone, chat or email. All of our hearing professionals are licensed by recognized third parties. Once a customer receives their Eargo hearing solution, their licensed hearing professional will schedule a welcome call to ensure the proper use of the Eargo solution. In 2020, more than 80% of our customers completed a welcome call with one of our licensed hearing professionals. Our licensed hearing professionals and customer care team are also available to provide unlimited support for as long as the customer owns the device. We also provide short, online training videos and additional resources that customers can access online. The combination of these services allows us to deliver telecare-based clinical support in an efficient and streamlined manner without the burden of in-clinic visits.

• | Affordable: Our vertically integrated, consumer-first model allows us to eliminate a layer of cost and offer our high-quality products at prices that are approximately half the average cost of a pair of hearing aids purchased through traditional channels in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decreased COVID-19 exposure: Without the need to physically visit a clinic, we believe our model can help Eargo customers reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19 when acquiring an Eargo hearing aid. We believe the pandemic has accelerated the pace of consumer awareness of our vertically integrated telecare model, and we are further investing in our business to build this leadership position.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We designed the Eargo solution to provide significant advantages relative to traditional solutions for hearing loss and believe that the high level of customer satisfaction that we have achieved demonstrates our strong value proposition.
 Growth drivers
 We believe we are transforming the hearing aid market and are working to establish the Eargo solution as the preferred approach to the treatment of hearing loss. We seek to achieve this goal by converting existing hearing aid users to the Eargo solution and attracting consumers who have historically chosen not to wear hearing aids. Our growth strategies include:
  
• | Accelerate consumer adoption: We operate in a large, underpenetrated market. We have sold, net of returns, over 60 thousand Eargo hearing aids as of December 31, 2020, which reflects less than 1% penetration of our estimated addressable market opportunity in the United States. We plan to grow our base of customers by efficiently investing in marketing targeted at the approximately 14 million people in the United States over the age of 50 with mild to moderate hearing loss who have annual household income above the national median in 2019. Our commercial strategy is focused on driving customers to our website by optimizing our mix of digital and traditional media, and increasing our customer conversion.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize customer mix: Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we began targeting a more diverse mix of consumers, including those with hearing aid health insurance benefits and repeat customers. We believe consumers with hearing aid insurance benefits typically convert at higher rates and return their devices at lower rates, due in part to having reduced or, in some cases, no out of pocket cost for an Eargo hearing aid. We believe repeat customers also have an attractive conversion and return profile due to their high satisfaction with Eargo. This more optimized mix of customers across cash pay, insurance and repeat categories has resulted in a lower overall customer acquisition cost. We believe this strategy has the potential to further improve the efficiency of our sales and marketing spend.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve sales team productivity: Our sales consultants leverage the powerful lead generation capabilities of our digital marketing platform, enabling them to be substantially more productive than traditional hearing care professionals working at hearing clinics. As demand accelerates, we believe we have an opportunity to further increase the productivity of our sales organization. To do so, we are leveraging data-driven insights to iterate our sales tactics and create incentive programs and promotional offers, each with the goal of increasing inbound lead conversions. We also see an opportunity to nurture long-term relationships with our customers to drive repeat purchases and increase their lifetime value.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Introduce new, innovative products: Since 2017, we have launched four generations of our hearing aids, each adding significant performance and technical enhancements. We are focused on continuing to launch new versions of the Eargo hearing solution that further improve audio quality, amplification, fit,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

comfort and ease-of-use. According to market data, a substantial portion of traditional hearing aid purchases are by repeat customers. As of December 31, 2020, over 16 thousand of our hearing aids systems sold, net of returns, were either Plus or Max systems that are over two years old. We began actively advertising to these customers for repeat purchases, which has contributed to our growth in gross systems shipped and revenues in 2020. We believe our product roadmap will drive adoption by new customers and encourage repeat purchases by existing customers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively pursue omni-channel opportunities: We believe there are numerous omni-channel opportunities that could provide access to additional channels and accelerate our customer acquisition growth. Some of these include partnering with retailers, pharmacies, payors and other consumer-oriented healthcare companies with similar customer demographics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand internationally: We believe the Eargo solution offers a compelling value proposition for consumers with hearing loss worldwide. In the future, we anticipate selectively expanding our commercial efforts to the large population of individuals with mild to moderate high-frequency hearing loss outside of the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our commercial strategy
 We designed a differentiated, consumer-first business model to empower the consumer and improve the accessibility and affordability of high-quality hearing aids. We currently market and sell our hearing aids directly to consumers with a personalized approach that we believe motivates them to take action and then guides them along their hearing journey.
 Brand awareness and demand generation
 Our consumer-first marketing efforts are focused on generating brand awareness and demand for the Eargo solution. We are working to further establish Eargo as a recognizable brand name in an industry traditionally characterized by large manufacturers generally lacking brand recognition. We believe we can achieve this by running empowering advertisements that are designed to appeal to prospective customers on a personal level. We seek to raise interest levels in potential customers who have not been motivated by the uninspiring messaging in the traditional channel and attract interested consumers who have not yet purchased a hearing aid due to the limitations of the traditional channel. We then nurture these potential customer relationships with educational marketing campaigns that are intended to develop comfort and familiarity with our brand.
 We also acquire customers that are interested in hearing aids through marketing channels such as paid search, social media and native advertising and draw them to our website with landing pages where they can learn more about us, submit their contact information for phone-based follow-up or purchase immediately.
 Sales and customer service process and infrastructure
 Our differentiated marketing and messaging is supported by a high touch, efficient team of professionals that guides the consumer through the journey of addressing their hearing loss with a personalized and consultative approach. We frequently review feedback and data our consumers provide to work to improve the customer experience.
 Consultative inside sales force
 We have an efficient, effective, centralized, sales force consisting of 55 sales consultants as of December 31, 2020. Our sales consultants act as advisors and work with the customer to understand their needs. We sell our hearing solution directly through our online store and through phone conversations with our sales consultants, which enables them to work with substantially more customers than traditional hearing care professionals in a clinic setting. In addition, from time to time and as requested by a prospective customer, we provide a pre-sales telecare visit with one of our licensed hearing professionals.
 15

Convenient professional support for as long as the customer owns the device
 Once a customer makes their purchase, they are assigned to one of our licensed hearing professionals who provides convenient clinical support by phone, online chat or email for the life of the product. Our licensed hearing professionals include audiologists with degrees in audiology and speech-language science, professionals with board certifications in hearing aid science and other professionals licensed for the treatment of hearing loss. After a customer receives their Eargo hearing aids, one of our licensed hearing professionals will initiate a welcome call to help ensure the proper use of the Eargo hearing aids. Our licensed hearing professionals and customer care team are also available to provide unlimited support for as long as the customer owns the device. We also provide short, online training videos and additional online resources that customers can access.
 We believe this consultative approach and ongoing support is key to developing strong customer relationships, increasing brand affinity and improving the lifetime value of customers. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 42 licensed hearing professionals.
 Technical capabilities
 In designing the Eargo hearing solution, we set out to offer a differentiated product with a compelling value proposition to the consumer centered on the ability to offer high quality audio performance in a virtually invisible and comfortable form factor, which poses significant engineering challenges.
 To address these challenges, we have established proprietary capabilities in the critical aspects of hearing aid design. We believe our distinct combination of engineering and design know-how coupled with intellectual property protection in certain key areas, enables us to offer an attractive, virtually invisible hearing aid while maintaining high quality audio performance.
  
• | Multi-channel compression in miniaturized form factor: High-fidelity multichannel compression is critical to hearing aid performance. A high-fidelity multichannel compression system dynamically amplifies the distinct acoustics of everyday life in a differentiated manner based on the frequency of the incoming sound. This ensures that the hearing aid offers comfortable and appropriate hearing support for the full range of everyday activities and sounds. While many hearing aid manufacturers have achieved this in behind-the-ear devices, to achieve this objective on a miniaturized platform that provides up to 16 hours of battery life requires ultra-low power integrated circuits and knowledge of assembly language programming on integrated circuits, which is becoming a rare skillset.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acoustic feedback cancellation: One of the primary challenges in audio signal processing for hearing aids that are located in the ear canal is acoustic feedback due to the close proximity of the microphone and the receiver. To address this, we have incorporated an adaptive feedback cancellation, or FBC, system. The most important figure to compare FBC systems is added stable gain, which reflects the increase in amplification gain that is afforded by the FBC system without added feedback or degraded sound quality. Our added stable gain of 24 dB compares to an added stable gain of approximately 20 decibels for an “open-fit” receiver-in-canal hearing aid.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Open canal design eliminating full occlusion: Our virtually invisible form factor requires the close collaboration of clinicians and engineers to achieve acoustic performance while limiting canal occlusion and maintaining ear health. Our proprietary and patented Flexi Fibers and Flexi Palms are a soft, medical-grade silicone web that allows our hearing aids to be suspended in the ear canal allowing for an “open fit” that offers high quality sound and comfort while staying firmly in place. Our engineers and clinicians play a critical role in improving the fit, migration, comfort and occlusion with each design iteration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the combination of technical capabilities and our innovative data driven approach to consumer-first marketing are a distinct competitive advantage for us in penetrating our target market.
 Our products
 We developed the Eargo solution to create a hearing aid that consumers actually want to use. We believe our hearing aids are the first and only rechargeable, completely-in-canal, FDA regulated, exempt Class I or Class II 
 16

devices for the treatment of hearing loss. We currently offer three versions of our Eargo solution, the Eargo Max, the Eargo Neo and the Eargo Neo HiFi, at three different price points to provide customers with choices on cost and functionality.
 Our Eargo products consist of the following: Eargo hearing aids, our proprietary Flexi Fibers or Flexi Palms depending on the hearing aid, our portable charger case and, with the Eargo Neo and Eargo Neo HiFi, tech-enabled through the Eargo mobile app.
  
• | Eargo hearing aids: Our hearing aids combine advanced technology, engineering and design to offer high-quality performance in an in-the-canal form factor that makes them virtually invisible. We have ultra-low-power integrated circuitry and advanced audio processing algorithms which enable high-quality audio, while preserving up to 16 hours of battery life. Our hearing aids are highly customizable, allowing our users to cycle through four different sound profiles, low to high amplification, while on the go to accommodate different ambient noise environments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary Flexi Fibers and Flexi Palms: Our proprietary Flexi Fibers and Flexi Palms, which are included as part of our hearing aids and can also be purchased separately, allow our hearing aids to be suspended in the ear canal providing an “open fit” that offers high quality sound and comfort while staying firmly in place. Our Flexi Fibers and Flexi Palms are made of a soft, medical-grade silicone and are designed to flex for comfortable, full day wear. Flexi Fibers and Flexi Palms are removable, allowing for simple cleaning, and we offer several sizes with each shipment to accommodate individuals with different size ear canals.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Portable charger case: Each set of Eargo hearing aids comes with a discreet, portable charger case that provides up to seven days’ worth of charge and easily fits into a purse or pocket. It takes approximately two hours to recharge the charger case and only approximately 30 minutes for the hearing aids to recharge within the case while on-the-go to provide up to two hours of additional use. Our charger case is designed to be discreet, while also protecting the hearing aids and maximizing airflow so that they dry while charging.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eargo mobile app: Our Eargo Neo and Eargo Neo HiFi offer a companion mobile app that allows customers to control their device and personalize their sound profiles. When paired with the charging case, customers can also wirelessly receive personalized sound settings based on their usage and preferences directly from our licensed hearing professionals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Research and development
 We are committed to ongoing research and development. As of December 31, 2020, our research and development organization included 67 individuals with expertise in mechanical engineering, product design, electrical engineering, systems engineering, audio processing, clinical and hearing science and embedded software design. Our technical capabilities and commitment to innovation have allowed us to deliver significant product enhancements on a rapid development timeline, which we believe has helped us to support a compelling new product roadmap.
 Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing future generations of our Eargo solution with increased functionality and audio output, improved in-ear fit, reduced cost of goods, better connectivity and enhanced machine learning.
 Comparative electroacoustic benchmarking tests
 In October 2019, we conducted a series of comparative electroacoustic benchmarking tests, or the Bench Study, to compare our Eargo Neo hearing aid with hearing aids from three major manufacturers: the Starkey Livio AI 2400, the Phonak Audeo Marvel M90, and the Resound Linx Quattro 5, all behind-the-ear style hearing aids with receiver-in-the-canal.
 17

The goal of the Bench Study was to conduct electroacoustic benchmarking tests to determine whether the hearing aids tested were able to amplify sounds appropriately to improve speech audibility while maintaining adequate sound quality.
 Our results indicated that both our Eargo Neo hearing aid and the other hearing aids we tested met or exceeded the identified benchmarks for sound quality and amplification to improve speech audibility. We believe the results of the Bench Study are useful to investors because they provide information regarding the comparability of our Eargo Neo hearing aid to the other hearing aids tested with respect to the identified benchmarks.
 Summary of Bench Study design
 We designed the Bench Study to use industry standard tests developed by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, the American organization that manages the voluntary standards system for electroacoustic tests.
 In addition, we evaluated the ability of each hearing aid in the Bench Study to make speech more understandable using another industry standard test called the Speech Intelligibility Index, or SII.
 The measurements were performed by two of our employees who are licensed audiologists using two different hearing aid test systems. One model of each device was utilized for testing. The results were then compared for discrepancies. If there were no major discrepancies, the better result of the two measures was used. If major discrepancies between the results existed, we performed both measures again. We defined a major discrepancy as the device meeting the identified standards in one test system but failing to meet the identified standards on the other system.
 Coupling using a 2cc coupler and placement of devices was used in accordance with ANSI S3.22-2009 specifications. Measurements were then taken with devices at either full-on-gain (FOG) or reference-test-setting (RTS) in accordance with ANSI standards.
 In order to determine what qualified as a good result, we reviewed recent research and used what we believe to be the most cited standards in the hearing aid industry as our benchmarks:
  
• | Frequency range: The frequency range should include 250 to 6000 Hz to cover the complete range of speech. Covering this large range of frequencies is important to appropriately amplify speech sounds.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Speech Intelligibility Index: The device should provide appropriate amplification for a specific hearing loss, as determined by the Audioscan Verifit test system. We chose a typical moderate hearing loss for this test.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Total harmonic distortion: The distortion level should be below 3% for all frequencies tested in order to amplify sound and speech with acceptable accuracy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equivalent input noise: The level of noise should be below 28 dB sound press level, or SPL. A low noise level means that the hearing aid can provide an acceptably clean sound to the listener.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Product roadmap
 We are continuously innovating and have released four new generations of our Eargo solution since 2017. Our current iteration of the Eargo hearing solution, Neo HiFi, provides improved Flexi Palms and improved capabilities across audio fidelity and bandwidth. We launched Neo HiFi in January 2020 and anticipate launching our next generation hearing aid in the first half of 2021.
 We anticipate that future generations of our solution will offer further improved fit and acoustic output with the capability for in-situ hearing assessment and adjustment through connected hearing aids. We expect that future generations of our solution will also include increased water resistance and have refurbishment capability. We believe this will advance the ability of our licensed hearing professionals to personalize our customers’ hearing 
 20

solutions. Our development priorities are also focused on adding a refurbishment capability, which would benefit our gross margin.
 

Manufacturing
 Our hearing aids are currently assembled by Hana, a contract manufacturer which is based in Thailand. We have a manufacturing services agreement with Hana for the assembly and supply of our hearing aids, pursuant to which we make purchases on a purchase order basis. The manufacturing services agreement was effective beginning on May 5, 2017 with an initial term of 12 months that automatically renews for additional 12 month periods. The automatic renewals are subject to our right to terminate the agreement without cause by providing 120 days’ advance written notice, or Hana’s right to terminate the agreement without cause by providing at least 12 months’ advance written notice.
 We have entered into a manufacturing services agreement with a second manufacturer, Pegatron Corporation, or Pegatron, which is based in Taiwan, for the manufacture of our next generation hearing aid, pursuant to which we make purchases on a purchase order basis. The manufacturing services agreement was effective beginning on August 21, 2018 with an initial term of three years that automatically renews for additional one-year periods. The automatic renewals are subject to either party’s right to terminate the agreement without cause by providing 30 days’ advance written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within 30 days after notice of such breach from the terminating party.
 We rely on several third-party suppliers for the components used in our hearing aids, including the batteries, integrated circuits, microphones and receivers.
 We believe that third-party facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture our hearing aids or any related components ourselves.
 Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, any products we sell are required to be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used 
 21

for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products.
 The distribution of our hearing aids is handled directly through DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics provider. Our finished hearing aids are shipped from Hana in Thailand to DCL Logistics in Louisville, Kentucky and are distributed from there to customers.
 Seasonality 
 Prior to the effects of COVID-19, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in our business, with higher sales volumes in quarters when we launch new products and in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of holiday promotional activity. 
Competition
 We compete in the hearing aid market against manufacturers, clinics and retailers of hearing aids, other direct-to-consumer providers of hearing aids and to a lesser extent, providers of personal sound amplification products (PSAPs). We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market are:

• | product quality and performance, including but not limited to, the size, sound quality, comfort, whether the batteries are rechargeable, reliability and connectivity of the hearing aid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer purchasing experience;
--+--------------------------------


• | visibility of hearing aid;
--+---------------------------


• | pricing;
--+---------


• | product support and service;
--+-----------------------------


• | effective marketing and education;
--+-----------------------------------


• | technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales and distribution capabilities.
--+-------------------------------------

 After a period of industry consolidation, five manufacturers control a vast majority of the hearing aid industry today. These manufacturers include GN Store Nord, Sonova, Starkey, William Demant and WS Audiology, all of which have established products and substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and development resources than we possess. In addition to these manufacturers, we also compete against hearing clinics and retailers, such as Costco. Costco sells its Kirkland Signature label behind-the-ear hearing aids in store and also sells behind-the-ear, in-the-ear and in-the-canal hearing aids under the Philips, Phonak, ReSound and Rexton brands, each at various price points. We also compete against other direct-to-consumer hearing aid providers such as Audicus and Lively, which, similar to our business model, allow consumers to purchase hearing aids without visiting a clinic and provide remote support for their products.
 Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Considering the resources and advantages that our competitors maintain, even if our technology and consumer-first distribution strategy is more effective than the technology and distribution strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our approach to addressing unmet needs in the hearing aid industry. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, margins and market share.
 22

Government regulation
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, design, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products in the United States. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny.
 Regulation by the FDA
 The FDA classifies hearing aids, including in-the-canal hearing aids such as our products, as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, as well as FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance and approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions, and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting of adverse events. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve or clear pending product applications.
 The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices for devices, as reflected in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse events, and truthful, non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the premarket notification process set forth in Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries and/or post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices must also comply with the FDA’s Section 510(k) premarket notification requirements. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Devices placed in Class III generally require the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing, or the receipt of a 510(k) de novo classification, which provides for the reclassification of the device into Class I or II. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process; however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive.
 We currently market our products pursuant to the FDA regulatory framework for air-conduction hearing aids, which are classified as Class I or Class II FDA Registered Exempt Medical Devices. While applicable FDA regulations establish certain “conditions for sale” of all hearing aids, including that prospective hearing aid users must have a medical evaluation by a licensed physician within the six months prior to the hearing aid dispensation, the FDA has stated that it does not intend to enforce these medical evaluation requirements prior to the dispensing of Class I air-conduction and Class II wireless air-conduction hearing aids to individuals 18 years of age and older. Accordingly, while we are required to comply with other FDA requirements, our products are currently not reviewed by the FDA.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, created a new category of over-the-counter, or OTC, hearing aids that are intended to be available through in-person transactions, by mail or online without the involvement of a licensed practitioner. Under the statute, the FDA must issue regulations to implement the new 
 23

framework. As part of its rulemaking process, the FDA is required to evaluate whether OTC hearing aids should be subject to Section 510(k) premarket review and clearance, and it is unclear whether the FDA will subject OTC hearing aids to this requirement or other more onerous requirements. Despite the deadline in FDARA for the FDA to issue proposed regulations by August 18, 2020, the FDA has not yet issued a notice of proposed rulemaking or indicated how it will implement the new OTC hearing aid pathway. In addition, in May 2018, the FDA granted a de novo classification request from Bose for a direct-to-consumer “self-fitting air-conduction hearing aid,” which is classified in Class II and subject to 510(k) premarket review.
 We market the Eargo system devices as Class I or Class II exempt air-conduction hearing aids under existing regulations and are not dependent on the FDA’s issuance of OTC hearing aid regulations for the marketing of our products. We also do not consider our devices to be “self-fitting” hearing aids similar to the newly cleared Bose device. Accordingly, while we expect our products to continue to be regulated as Class I or Class II exempt devices, our products could in the future be deemed to fall under the definition of a “self-fitting air-conduction hearing aid” or an OTC hearing aid, in which case we could be required to seek 510(k) clearance for our products or otherwise comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with these new pathways.
 510(k) clearance
 If not exempted from the FDA’s 510(k) notification requirement, to obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (commonly known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted), a device which the FDA has reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent to such a device through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence may sometimes, but not always, require clinical data. Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once a 510(k) submission is accepted for review, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. The review period is suspended during the time the additional information request is pending. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees.
 Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials or method of manufacture, or that would constitute a new or major change in intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an additional FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification constitutes such a change is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require submission of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed to be a non-significant risk device which may be subject to more abbreviated IDE 
 24

requirements. If an IDE is required, the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical sites must approve the study before clinical trials may begin. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of IRBs for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product.
 Labeling and sale
 All hearing aids commercially distributed in the United States must comply with specific FDA labeling requirements. These requirements address the labeling of the device itself as well as the User Instructional Brochure that must be provided to all potential hearing aid recipients. Hearing aids must be clearly and permanently marked with, among other things, the name of the device manufacturer, the model name or number, and the year of manufacture. In addition, the User Instructional Brochure must contain, among other things, specific instructions for the use of, maintenance and care of, and replacement or recharging of the batteries of the hearing instrument, information regarding known side effects that may warrant a physician consultation, a warning statement specified in FDA regulations, and technical data useful in selecting and fitting a hearing instrument and checking its performance.
 In addition, FDA regulations require that the marketing of hearing aids comply with certain “conditions for sale,” including, among other things, the requirement that prospective hearing aid users must undergo a medical evaluation (or provide a signed waiver) before a hearing aid may be dispensed, along with certain recordkeeping requirements. In 2016, the FDA issued a guidance document stating that it did not intend to enforce the medical evaluation or recordkeeping requirements prior to the dispensing of Class I air-conduction and Class II wireless air-conduction hearing aids to individuals 18 years of age and older. In addition, under FDARA, hearing aids that qualify for the future OTC pathway must be exempt from certain labeling requirements and condition of sale requirements otherwise applicable to hearing aids.
 Quality System Regulation
 The hearing aids that we commercially distribute in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. This includes product listing and establishment registration requirements, which facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. We are required to adhere to applicable current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. We are also required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with applicable quality and regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of contractors. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from the QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution.
 Post-market surveillance
 We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. We must also comply with medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA corrections and removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the 
 25

FDCA that may present a risk to health. Although we may undertake recall actions voluntarily, we must submit detailed information on any recall action to the FDA, and the FDA can order a medical device recall in certain circumstances.
 In addition to post-market quality and safety actions, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA as required under the MDR regulations, can result in enforcement action by the FDA which can include any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications or repair, replacement, refund, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA refusals or delays on requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products;’
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for products; or
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
--+-----------------------------------------

 Other healthcare laws and regulations
 The healthcare industry is also subject to federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and physician payment transparency laws, as well as patient data privacy and security and consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to certain state and local hearing care laws, including those applicable to the licensure and registration of audiologists and other individuals that dispense hearing aids, sales and marketing practices, interactions with consumers, consumer incentive and other promotional programs, and state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions.
 Fraud and abuse laws
 In addition to the FDA, other federal and state healthcare laws and regulations could restrict our business practices and operations, including our direct-to-consumer activities. To the extent our products are or become covered by any federal or state government healthcare program, regulatory and enforcement authorities may nonetheless interpret that we are subject to numerous federal healthcare anti-fraud laws, which include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral Law and the False Claims Act that are intended to reduce waste, fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and analogous state laws that may apply to healthcare items and services paid by all payors, including self-pay patients and private insurers. These laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations. They prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries, other than healthcare, including pricing, sales and marketing activities, sales commissions, customer incentive and other promotional programs, and the provision of gifts and business courtesies. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. We must operate our business within the requirements of these laws. Violations of any of these health regulatory laws may result in potentially significant penalties, including criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 26

In addition, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers to report to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals and, with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021, financial arrangements with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. These reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information, but not those that require reports of different or additional information. Although none of our products are currently covered by any government healthcare program, we may still be subject to certain state reporting requirements that apply regardless of payor. Failure to comply subjects manufacturers to significant civil monetary penalties.
 State licensing, corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions
 Regulation of the hearing aid industry exists in every state. These laws and regulations are primarily concerned with the licensure and registration of audiologists and other individuals and companies that dispense hearing aids, including procedures involving the fitting and dispensing of hearing aids. In addition, most states require warranty and return policies for consumers allowing for the return of product, and restrict hearing aid advertising and marketing practices. These state laws are subject to change, and states may impose more stringent requirements for dispensers of hearing aids. The FDCA preempts state laws relating to the safety and efficacy of medical devices and state laws that are different from or in addition to federal requirements. In Missouri Board of Examiners for Hearing Instrument Specialists v. Hearing Help Express, Inc. and METX, LLC v. Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, respectively, have held that certain state laws relating to the fitting and dispensing of hearing aids are preempted because they relate to the safety and efficacy of medical devices. Although we have structured our operations to comply with our understanding of applicable state regulatory requirements, interpretative legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed, including which laws and regulations are subject to the federal preemption relating to safety and efficacy of medical devices, complicating our compliance efforts. Other courts could conclude that similar or identical state laws are not preempted. A determination that we are in violation of applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements to comply with the requirements of that jurisdiction, if we are required to restructure our operations and arrangements at a significant cost, or if we are subject to penalties or other adverse action.
 We employ licensed hearing professionals to deliver services to our customers. These activities are subject to various state laws that prohibit the practice of certain professions, including audiology, by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the audiologist’s or other hearing care specialist’s professional judgment. In the event that regulatory authorities or other third parties were to challenge these arrangements, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations, to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our arrangements with our audiologists and other licensed professionals. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing or splitting professional fees with lay entities or persons. Audiologists and certain other hearing care specialists are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice and must comply with numerous state and local licensing laws and regulations, and each state defines the scope of practice for audiologists and other hearing care specialists through legislation and their respective state regulatory agencies and boards. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject our personnel to sanctions or may even result in loss of their licensure and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well.
 Coverage and reimbursement; healthcare reform
 Our products are primarily purchased on a cash-pay basis and are not generally covered by government healthcare programs and other third-party payors. In addition, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking, among other things, to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our results of operations. For example, the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially and has affected medical device manufacturers significantly. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other 
 27

providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes or other healthcare reform measures by the current Presidential Administration may impact our business or financial condition. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Privacy and security
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, HITECH mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the HHS, affected individuals and, if the breach is large enough, the media.
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
 In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. In Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Union (the “EU”) and the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply 
 28

with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”), which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
 International laws
 Globally, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 Intellectual property
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2020, we had 22 issued U.S. patents, 16 patents outside the United States, 4 pending U.S. patent applications and 10 pending foreign patent applications. Our patents include utility patents covering technology ranging from remote control of our hearing aids to design patents covering the housing and securing mechanisms for our hearing aids. We have foreign patents in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We own all of our patents and do not rely on any licenses to utilize the technology covered by these patents. The earliest of our patents is expected to expire in 2025. Our issued U.S. patent with claims generally directed to an open ear canal hearing aid comprised of certain electronics and securing portions and our issued U.S. patent with claims generally directed to an adjustable securing mechanism for a space access device are each expected to expire in 2030.
 Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge certain patents issued to us as invalid, may independently develop similar or competing technologies or may design around any of our patents. We cannot be certain that any of the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights in these countries as fully as in the United States.
 29

There is no active patent litigation involving us and we have not received any notices of patent infringement involving any of our products. The validity, enforceability or scope, as the case may be, of one of our patents relating to our Flexi Palm design is being challenged in Europe. An oral hearing for this challenge is expected to be scheduled in 2021. The preliminary opinion from the European Patent Office’s Opposition Division considered the claims to be novel, inventive and sufficient of disclosure, while only making objections regarding added matter. Our response includes a main request to maintain the claims of the patent as-is and 11 auxiliary requests, each of which we believe will still provide coverage of the Flexi Palms. While any result that narrows or invalidates this patent could harm our ability to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design, we believe the result of these proceedings will not result in the patent being invalidated and that any result that relies upon one of the auxiliary requests would still provide us coverage regarding Flexi Palms in Europe.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 35 trademark registrations and 8 pending trademark applications worldwide.
 Environmental matters
 Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe, based on current information that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our products, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our products or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business.
 Human capital resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 238 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
