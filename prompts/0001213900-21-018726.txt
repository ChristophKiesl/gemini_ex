Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on high growth technology and tech-enabled businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
On November 27, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 17,500,000 units (the “units”). Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $175 million. In connection with the initial public offering, the underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 2,625,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 18, 2020, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 2,625,000 units, generating additional gross proceeds of $26,250,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the “private placement”) of an aggregate of 5,500,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to 10X Capital SPAC Sponsor I LLC (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,500,000.
 
Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on August 10, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares (the “founder shares”) of our Class B common stock to our Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On November 16, 2020, our Sponsor forfeited an aggregate of 1,293,750 founder shares to us for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 5,031,250 founder shares.
 
A total of $201,250,000, comprised of $197,750,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the closing of the over-allotment option (which amount includes $7,568,750 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $3,500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
The funds held in the trust account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by May 27, 2022,
 
As of December 31, 2020, there was $201,251,614 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes interest income available to us for franchise and income tax obligations of approximately $1,614 and $1,462,570 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2020, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the trust account to pay taxes.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. All activity through December 31, 2020 relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate nonoperating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the initial public offering.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on high growth technology and tech-enabled businesses domestically and abroad in the consumer internet, ecommerce, software, healthcare and financial services industries, as well as other industries that are being disrupted by advances in technology and on technology paradigms including artificial intelligence (“AI”), automation, data science, ecommerce and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”). Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended on November 24, 2020, our “amended and restated certificate of incorporation”) prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or a valuation or appraisal from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a due diligence review that may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.
 
Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of the initial business combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is approximately $10.00 per public share as of December 31, 2020. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor, our officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and shares of Class A common stock underlying the private placement warrants (the “private placement shares”) and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
 
Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
 
Submission of our initial business combination to a stockholder vote
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are voted in favor of the initial business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased, in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable laws and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until May 27, 2022, to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by May 27, 2022, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest is net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by May 27, 2022.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have four (4) officers: Hans Thomas, David Weisburd, Guhan Kandasamy and Oliver Wriedt. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Recent Developments
 
On February 3, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with REE Automotive Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Israel (“REE”) and Spark Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of REE (“Merger Sub”), which provides for, among other things, the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of REE (the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”).
 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (the “Effective Time”), (i) each preferred share, par value NIS 0.01 each, of REE (each, a “REE Preferred Share”) will be converted into ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.01 each, of REE (each, a “REE Class A Ordinary Share”) in accordance with REE’s organizational documents and (ii) immediately following such conversion but prior to the Effective Time, REE will effect a stock split of each REE Class A Ordinary Share into such number of REE Class A Ordinary Shares calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement such that each REE Class A Ordinary Share will have a value of $10.00 per share after giving effect to such stock split (the “Stock Split” and, together with the conversion of REE Preferred Shares, the “Capital Restructuring”).

The Stock Split will be calculated based upon an enterprise valuation of REE of $3.0 billion on a cash-free and debt-free basis, estimated at the time of the signing of the Merger Agreement. No purchase price adjustments will be made in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each issued and outstanding unit of the Company comprising one share of Company Common Stock and one-half of one warrant to purchase one share of Company Common Stock, shall be automatically separated and the holder thereof shall be deemed to hold one share of Company Common Stock and one-half of one Company warrant; and (ii) each outstanding share of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (“Company Class B Common Stock”) shall convert into 1.5763975 (the “Class B Share Conversion Ratio”) shares of Company Common Stock. Immediately thereafter, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive one newly issued REE Class A Ordinary Share. Upon conversion of the Company Class B Common Stock into Company Common Stock, the holders of Company Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive a number of additional shares (the “Anti-Dilution Shares”) of Company Common Stock equal to 25% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued to the PIPE Investors. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the holders of the shares of the Company Class B Common Stock have agreed to waive their right to receive any Anti-Dilution Shares in excess of 2,900,000 (the “Conversion Ratio Adjustment”), with such waiver resulting in the Class B Share Conversion Ratio. In addition, up to 1,500,000 of the 2,900,000 Anti-Dilution Shares to be received upon the conversion of the Company Class B Common Stock will be subject to subsequent forfeiture without consideration if trading prices of REE Class A Ordinary Shares specified below are not achieved following the Business Combination. The Company’s outstanding warrants to purchase one share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive an equal number of warrants to purchase one REE Class A Ordinary Share (the “REE Warrants”).
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties thereto and the closing is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
