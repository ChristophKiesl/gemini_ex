Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies and were incorporated under the laws of the 
 State of Delaware on February 5, 2015 (Inception). On January 30, 2020, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of 
 Delaware to the State of Maryland. On January 31, 2020, the Company completed a transaction to acquire Alcentra Capital Corporation in a cash and stock transaction (the Alcentra Acquisition). The Company was listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 3, 2020. 
 We have elected to be treated as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (1940 Act). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets, source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest. 
 We are managed by our investment adviser, Crescent Cap Advisors, LLC (the Adviser, and formerly, CBDC Advisors, LLC), an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. Our administrator, CCAP Administration LLC (the Administrator, and formerly, CBDC Administration, LLC) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Company management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Adviser and Administrator along with our Board. The Adviser directs and executes our investment operations and capital raising activities subject to oversight from the Board, which sets our broad policies. The Board has delegated investment management of our investment assets to the Adviser. The Board consists of five directors, four of whom are independent. 
 Our primary investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We seek to achieve our investment objectives by investing primarily in secured debt (including senior secured first lien, unitranche and senior secured second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured, mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated over-the-counter market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans and bonds to complement our private credit transactions. 
 Our investment objective is accomplished through: 
 

 | accessing the origination channels that have been developed and established by Crescent;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | originating investments in what we believe to be middle-market companies with strong business fundamentals, generally controlled by private equity investors that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and leveraged buyouts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | applying Crescents underwriting standards; and
--+------------------------------------------------


 | leveraging Crescents experience and resources to monitor our investments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our investment philosophy emphasizes capital preservation through credit selection and risk mitigation. We expect our targeted portfolio to provide downside protection through conservative cash flow and asset coverage requirements, priority in the capital structure and information requirements. 
 As a BDC under the Act and a RIC under the Code, our portfolio is subject to diversification and other requirements. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences. 
 We have formed or acquired wholly owned subsidiaries that are structured as tax blockers, to hold equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies or other forms of pass-through entities. We have also formed a special purpose vehicle that holds certain debt investments in connection with a credit facility. These corporate subsidiaries are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of portfolio companies.

 We may borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (up to 150% of asset coverage requirement). In determining whether to borrow money, we analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock offerings to make investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureWe are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment, and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments, changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income. Further, changes in LIBOR or its discontinuation may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-indexed securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit in our portfolio. 
 The Investment Adviser 
 The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Crescent, acts as our investment adviser. The Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has entered into a Resource Sharing Agreement (the Resource Sharing Agreement) with Crescent, pursuant to which Crescent provides the Adviser with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Advisers investment committee) and access to Crescents resources so as to enable the Adviser to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Adviser capitalizes on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Crescents investment professionals. 
About Crescent 
 Crescent Capital Corporation, a predecessor to the business of Crescent, was formed in 1991 by Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus as an asset management firm specializing in below-investment grade debt securities. In 1995, Crescent Capital Corporation was acquired by The TCW Group, Inc. (TCW) and rebranded as TCWs Leveraged Finance Group. On January 1, 2011, Messrs. Attanasio and Chapus, along with the entire investment team, spun out of TCW and formed Crescent, an employee-owned, registered investment adviser. With its headquarters in Los Angeles, Crescent has over 180 employees based in four offices in the U.S. and Europe. Messrs. Attanasio and Chapus head Crescents management committee, which oversees all of Crescents operations. On January 5, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, Sun Life) acquired a majority interest in Crescent (the Sun Life Transaction). There were no changes to our investment objective, strategies and process or to the Crescent team responsible for the investment operations as a result of the Sun Life Transaction. 
The Board of Directors 
 Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board consists of five members, four of whom are not interested persons of CCAP, the Adviser, the Administrator or their respective affiliates as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. We refer to these individuals as our Independent Directors. The Independent Directors compose a majority of our Board. Our Board elects our officers, who serve at the discretion of our Board. The responsibilities of our Board include quarterly determinations of the fair value of our assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of our financing arrangements and oversight of our investment activities. 
Investment Strategy 
 We follow Crescents approach to investing, which is based upon fundamental credit research and risk analysis. This approach reflects Crescents view that the cornerstone of successful investing is fundamental credit analysis. 
 Specifically, we pursue an investment strategy targeting companies primarily in the middle-market. We believe that the middle-market is attractive as a result of the lack of available lending sources to smaller companies. We believe many financing providers have chosen to focus on large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets. We also believe hedge funds and collateralized debt obligation/collateralized loan obligation managers are less likely to pursue investment opportunities in our target market as a result of reduced liquidity for new investments. Specifically, Crescents sourcing platform should enable it, on our behalf and through our Adviser, to identify and invest in creditworthy borrowers. In addition, to take advantage of investment opportunities in middle-market companies that are identified for us by Crescent, we may invest alongside other pools of capital, including bank debt, high-yield and mezzanine funds managed by Crescent. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for a discussion of certain conflicts of interest of Crescent and certain limitations on our ability to co-invest with other accounts advised by Crescent.

 We target investments in companies that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: 
 

 | businesses with strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses operating in industries with barriers to entry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses in industries with positive long-term dynamics;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses with cash flows that are dependable and predictable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses with management teams with demonstrated track records and economic incentives; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | businesses controlled by private equity investors that require capital for growth, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek to create a diversified portfolio of investments across various industries as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends, although our investments may be concentrated in a small number of industries. 
 Investment Focus 
 Generally, we focus on investing in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured, mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. By middle-market companies, we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million. We may on occasion invest in larger or smaller companies. 
 First lien investments are senior loans on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuers capital structure that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. 
 Unitranche first lien investments are loans that may extend deeper in a companys capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, the Company may find another lender to provide the first out portion of such loan and retain the last out portion of such loan, in which case, the first out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the last out portion that the Company would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the last out portion earns a higher interest rate. 
 Second lien investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche first lien lenders in those assets. 
 Mezzanine or unsecured debt investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrowers equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrowers other senior indebtedness. 
 We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade (e.g., junk bonds) by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Investments We may invest in high yield debt, or junk bonds, which has greater credit and liquidity risk than more highly rated debt obligations. Our investments may include non-cash income features, including PIK interest and OID. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Investments Our investments in OID and PIK interest income may expose us to risks associated with such income being required to be included in accounting income and taxable income prior to receipt of cash. 
 Our business model is focused on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies. The companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations. We expect to generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from debt investments, dividend income from direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. 
 We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated over-the-counter market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans and bonds to complement our private credit transactions. In addition, and because we often receive more attractive financing terms on broadly syndicated loans and bonds than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portfolio in such a way that can maximize the levered return potential of our portfolio. 
 Investment Decision Process 
 Through Crescents resources, the Adviser has access to origination capabilities and research resources, experienced investment professionals, internal information systems and a credit analysis framework and investment process. Over the years, Crescent has designed its investment process to seek investments which it believes have the most attractive risk/reward characteristics. The process involves multiple levels of review and is coordinated in an effort to identify risks in potential investments. Our Adviser applies 
 
6 


  Crescents expertise to screen our investment opportunities as described below. Depending on the type of investment and the borrower, the Adviser may apply all or some of these levels of review, in its discretion. Based upon a favorable outcome of the diligence process described below, our Advisers investment committee will make a final decision on such investment and such investment will only be funded after approval by the Advisers investment committee. 
 Private Credit Originations: New private credit investment opportunities are initially reviewed by a Crescent senior investment professional to determine whether additional consideration is warranted. Factors influencing this decision include fundamental business considerations, including borrower industry, borrower financial leverage and cash flows and quality of management as well as private equity sponsor involvement (if any). In the event of an initial positive review, potential investments are further reviewed with senior and junior investment professionals. If the team agrees on the fundamental attractiveness of the investment, the review phase proceeds with preliminary due diligence and financial analyses. At this point, Crescent utilizes its credit analysis methodology to outline credit and operating statistics and identify key business characteristics and risks through available diligence materials in addition to dialogue with company management and the proposed private equity sponsor (if any). Following this analysis, Crescent considers an initial structure and pricing proposal for the investment and preliminarily informs the broader investment team of such proposal. 
 After satisfactory preliminary analysis and review, further due diligence continues, including completion of credit analysis, on-site due diligence (if deemed necessary), visits and meetings with management, and could include consultation with third-party experts. The credit analysis is a detailed, bottom-up analysis on the proposed portfolio company that generally includes an assessment of its industry, market, competition, products, services, management and the equity sponsor or owner. Detailed financial analysis is also performed at this stage with a focus on historical financial results. Projected financial information developed by the proposed portfolio company is analyzed and sensitized based upon the portfolio companys historical results and assessment of the portfolio companys future prospects. The sensitivity analysis highlights the variability of revenues and earnings, worst case debt service coverage and available sources of liquidity. As part of the overall evaluation, comparisons are made to similar companies to help assess a portfolio companys asset and enterprise value coverage of debt, interest servicing capacity and competitive strength within its industry and market. Additionally during this stage, Crescent typically works with the management of the proposed portfolio company and its other capital providers to develop the structure of an investment, including negotiating among these parties on how the investment is expected to perform relative to the other forms of capital in its capital structure. 
 Syndicated Investments: For syndicated investments, Crescent seeks to pursue an investment process based upon evaluation of the credit fundamentals of issuers. The foundation of this process is the bottom-up credit research process that Crescent employs across multiple strategies. In selecting investments, Crescents investment professionals perform comprehensive analysis of credit worthiness, including an assessment of the business, an evaluation of management, an analysis of business strategy and industry trends, an examination of financial results and projections and a review of the securitys proposed terms. Credit research is a critical component of the investment process. In selecting investments, Crescents respective portfolio management teams analyze opportunities with an emphasis on principal preservation (i.e., an issuers ability to service its debt and maintain cash flow). 
Investment Funding 
 Upon completion of the investment decision process described above, the investment team working on an investment delivers a memorandum to the Advisers investment committee. Once an investment has been approved by the investment committee, the Adviser moves through a series of steps with the respective investment team towards negotiation of final documentation. 
Investment Monitoring 
 The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis by monitoring the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. We consider board observation rights, where appropriate, regular dialogue with company management and equity sponsors and detailed internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 

1 | Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment/borrower is performing above expectations since investment, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the financial performance of the borrower or a potential exit.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of investment. The investment/borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3 | Involves an investment/borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the investments risk has increased somewhat since investment. The borrowers loan payments are generally not past due and more likely than not the borrower will remain in compliance with debt covenants. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4 | Involves an investment/borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has increased materially since investment. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Placing loans on non-accrual status should be considered for investments rated 4.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 


 
5 | Involves an investment/borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has substantially increased since investment. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and the fair market value of the loan are generally reduced to the anticipated recovery amount. Loans with an investment rating of 5 are generally placed on non-accrual status.

Investment Advisory Agreement 
 On June 2, 2015, we entered into an investment advisory agreement with the Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement), which was subsequently replaced by the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement (together with the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisory Agreements), which was approved by our stockholders on January 29, 2020 in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition resulting in the change of certain terms. Subsequently on December 17, 2020 in connection with the Sun Life Transaction, the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement was re-approved by our stockholders resulting in no substantive changes to the terms. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to us and our portfolio investments. The Advisers services under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreements, the Adviser is entitled to receive a base management fee and may also receive incentive fees, as discussed below. 
Base Management Fee (prior to February 1, 2020) 
 Prior to February 1, 2020, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.50% of our gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee was calculated based on the average value of gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser agreed to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of the sum of (i) 0.25% of the aggregate committed but undrawn capital and (ii) 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents (including capital drawn to pay our expenses) during the period prior to February 3, 2020, the date of the our qualified initial public offering, as defined by the Investment Advisory Agreement (Qualified IPO). The listing of our Common Stock on NASDAQ on February 3, 2020 qualified as a Qualified IPO. The Adviser is not permitted to recoup any waived amounts at any time. 
 New Base Management Fee (effective February 1, 2020) 
 Effective February 1, 2020, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25% of our gross assets, including assets acquired through the incurrence of debt but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. 
 In addition, under the terms of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the Adviser agreed to waive a portion of the management fee from February 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021 after the closing of the Alcentra Acquisition so that only 0.75% shall be charged for such time period. The Adviser is not permitted to recoup any waived amounts at any time. The Adviser has voluntarily waived its right to receive management fees on our investment in GACP II LP for any period in which GACP II LP remains in the investment portfolio. 
 Incentive Fee (prior to February 1, 2020) 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Incentive Fee consisted of two parts. The first part, the income incentive fee, was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equaled (a) 100% of the excess of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of 1.5% per quarter (6.0% annualized) (the Hurdle), and a catch-up feature until the Adviser received 15% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter up to 1.7647% (the Catch-up), and (b) 15% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the Catch-up.
The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year at a rate of 15.0% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from Inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. 
 

8 


 At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, in connection with the extension of the deadline to consummate a Qualified IPO, the Adviser agreed to waive its rights under the Investment Advisory Agreement to (i) the income incentive fee and (ii) the capital gain incentive fee for the period from April 1, 2018 through February 1, 2020. 
 Incentive Fee (effective February 1, 2020) 
 Under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the Incentive Fee consists of two parts. The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and (a) equals 100% of the excess of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of 1.75% per quarter (7.0% annualized) (the Hurdle), and a catch-up feature until the Adviser has received 17.5%, of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter up to 2.1212% (the Catch-up), and (b) 17.5% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the Catch-up.
In addition, under the terms of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser agreed to waive the income based portion of the incentive fee from February 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021. Once the Adviser begins to earn income incentive fees, the Adviser will voluntarily waive the income incentive fees attributable to the investment income accrued by us as a result of our investment in GACP II. 
 The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year at a rate of 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from Inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. 
 Since the Qualified IPO occurred on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the income incentive fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after a Qualified IPO based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the Qualified IPO. For the avoidance of doubt, such capital gains incentive fee shall be equal to 15.0% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from Inception through the day before the Qualified IPO, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Following the Qualified IPO, solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, we will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to a Qualified IPO equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to the Qualified IPO by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5% by (y) 15.0%. In the event that the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during each calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for such quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding debt or preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market discount, original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income will be compared to a Hurdle Amount equal to the product of (i) the Hurdle rate of 1.50% or 1.75% per quarter, 6.00% or 7.00% annualized, prior to and effective February 1, 2020, respectively, and (ii) our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness, before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period), at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up provision incurred at the end of each calendar quarter. 
 See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureOur management and incentive fee structure may create incentives for the Adviser that are not fully aligned with the interests of our stockholders and may induce the Adviser to make speculative investments.
GAAP Incentive Fee on Cumulative Unrealized Capital Appreciation 
 We accrue, but do not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, we are required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, we consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 15% (pre February 3, 2020) or 17.5% (effective February 3, 2020) of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.

 Our Board monitors the mix and performance of our investments over time and will seek to satisfy itself that the Adviser is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Adviser to do so. 
 Term 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until January 5, 2023 and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the vote of a majority of our independent directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Business and StructureWe are dependent upon key personnel of Crescent and the Adviser. 
 Indemnification 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under that agreement. The Adviser will not be responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow the Advisers advice or recommendations. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including, without limitation, the Administrator, and any person controlling or controlled by the Adviser will not be liable to us, any of our subsidiaries, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiarys stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of the duties that the Adviser owes to us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, as part of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the Adviser and each of its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Investment Advisory Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of such persons duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement. These protections may lead the Adviser to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days written notice to the other party. 
 United States federal and state securities laws may impose liability under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith. Nothing in the Investment Advisory Agreement constitutes a waiver or limitation of any rights that we may have under any applicable federal or state securities laws. 
 Administration Agreement 
 On June 2, 2015, we entered into the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, as amended and restated on February 1, 2020. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Administrator under the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, the Administrator is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties. To the extent the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis, without incremental profit to the Administrator. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days written notice to the other party. 
 No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Administrator or its affiliates and who serves as a director receives any compensation for his or her services as a director. However, we reimburse the Administrator (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Administrator or its affiliates to our compliance professionals, legal counsel, and other professionals who spend time on such related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). The allocable portion of the compensation for these officers and other professionals are included in the administration expenses paid to the Administrator. Directors who are not affiliated with the Administrator or its affiliates receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings. 
 On June 5, 2015, we entered into sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (SST) to perform certain administrative, custodian and other services. The sub-administration agreement with SST had an initial term of three years ending June 5, 2018 and shall automatically renew for 1-year terms unless a written notice of non-renewal is delivered by us or SST. We do not reimburse the Administrator for any services for which we pay a separate sub-administrator and custodian fee to SST.

 The Administration Agreement has been approved by our Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from their effective date and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of our Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the vote of a majority of our independent directors. The Administration Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of assignment. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureDependence Upon Key Personnel of Crescent. 
 License Agreement 
 We have entered into a license agreement with Crescent under which Crescent granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Crescent Capital. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
 We expect to use the expertise of Crescents investment professionals to which we will have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of Crescents senior members will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to our Business and Structure  We operate in an increasingly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could make it difficult for us to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. 
 Fees and Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees and incentive fees to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as amended, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement, operating costs associated with our sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company and other operating costs described below. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 
 

 | the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fidelity bond, directors and officers liability insurance and other insurance premiums;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | independent directors fees and expenses;
--+------------------------------------------


 | administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrators overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, rent and the allocable portion of the cost of certain professional services provided to us, including but not limited to, our compliance professionals, our legal counsel and other professionals);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | U.S. federal, state and local taxes;
--+-------------------------------------


 | the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | brokerage commissions;
--+-----------------------


 | costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We agreed to repay the Adviser for initial organization costs and equity offering costs incurred prior to the commencement of our operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million on a pro rata basis over the first $350.0 million of invested capital not to exceed 3 years from the initial capital commitment on June 26, 2015. The initial 3 year term was later extended to June 30, 2019, with shareholder approval. To the extent such costs related to equity offerings, these costs were charged as a reduction of capital upon the issuance of common shares. To the extent such costs related to organization costs, these costs were expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon the issuance of common shares. The Adviser was responsible for organization and private equity offerings costs in excess of $1.5 million. 
 Capital Resources and Borrowings 
 We anticipate cash to be generated from future offerings of securities, and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In connection with borrowings, our lenders may require us to pledge assets, investor commitments to fund capital calls and/or the proceeds of those capital calls. In addition, the lenders may ask us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 For more information on our debt, see ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) 
 We adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then stockholders who are participating in the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. 
Resource Sharing Agreement 
 We do not currently have any employees. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the investment professionals of the Adviser to achieve our investment objective. The Adviser is an affiliate of Crescent and depends upon access to the investment professionals and other resources of Crescent and its affiliates to fulfill its obligations to us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Adviser also depends upon Crescent to obtain access to deal flow generated by Crescents investment professionals and its affiliates. Each of our officers will also be an employee of the Adviser, Crescent or its affiliates. 
 Pursuant to its Resource Sharing Agreement with Crescent, the Adviser will have access to the individuals who comprise our Advisers investment committee, and a team of additional experienced investment professionals who, collectively, comprise the Advisers investment team. The Adviser may hire additional investment professionals to provide services to us, based upon its needs. 
 Regulation as a Business Development Company 
 We are regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending primarily to private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A publicly-traded BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly-traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. Prior to February 3, 2020, which is the date of our listing on NASDAQ in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition, our stock was privately held. 
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such companys voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
 As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we will be 
 
12 


  prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC through an exemptive relief order (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance). 
 Also, while we may borrow funds to make investments, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant aspects. In particular, under the provisions of the 1940 Act, BDCs are generally able to issue senior securities such that their asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. In March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act added Section 61(a)(2) to the 1940 Act, a successor provision to Section 61(a)(1) referenced therein, which reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200% to 150% so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. On March 3, 2020, our Board of Directors approved, and on May 4, 2020, at an annual meeting of our stockholders, our stockholders approved, the application to us of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act. The application of the reduced asset coverage requirement, which became effective on May 4, 2020, permits us, provided certain requirements are satisfied, to double the maximum amount of leverage that it is permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirement applicable to us from 200% to 150% (i.e., we are permitted to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities issued by us) in order to incur debt or issue preferred stock (which we refer to collectively as senior securities). 
 We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intention to be a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. 
 We are subject to periodic examinations by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 We may invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in non-qualifying assets. However, under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDCs total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

1. | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a) | Issuer is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Issuer is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | Issuer satisfies any of the following:
---+---------------------------------------


i. | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13 


 
4. | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 A BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described under Qualifying Assets above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors or officers, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 
Monitoring Investments 
 In most cases, we will not have board influence over portfolio companies. In some instances, the Advisers investment professionals may obtain board representation or observation rights in conjunction with our investments. In conjunction with our Advisers investment committee and our Board, the Adviser will take an active approach in monitoring all investments, which includes reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and may include discussions with management and/or the equity sponsor. The monitoring process will begin with structuring terms and conditions which require the timely delivery and access to critical financial and business information regarding portfolio companies. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. See Item I. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesElection to be Taxed as a RIC. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Senior Securities 
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, as amended, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. 
 The 1940 Act imposes limitations on a BDCs issuance of preferred shares, which are considered senior securities and thus are subject to the 150% asset coverage requirement described above. In addition, (i) preferred shares must have the same voting rights as the common stockholders (one share, one vote); and (ii) preferred stockholders must have the right, as a class, to appoint directors to the board of directors. 
 
14 


 Code of Ethics 
 As required by Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, we and the Adviser have adopted codes of ethics which apply to, among others, our and our Advisers executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as our Advisers officers, directors and employees. Our codes of ethics generally will not permit investments by our and the Advisers personnel in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. 
 We hereby undertake to provide a copy of the codes to any person, without charge, upon request. Requests for a copy of the codes may be made in writing addressed to our Secretary, George Hawley, Crescent Capital BDC, Inc., 11100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 2000, Los Angeles, California, 90025, Attention: CCAP Investor Relations, or by emailing us at investor.relations@crescentcap.com. Our code of ethics is available without charge on our website, at http://www.crescentbdc.com. 
 Compliance Policies and Procedures 
 We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and NASDAQ Corporate Governance Regulations 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 

 | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and (once we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act or, if later, for the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC) must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 In addition, NASDAQ has adopted various corporate governance requirements as part of its listing standards. We monitor our compliance with such listing standards to the extent applicable and will take actions necessary to ensure that we remain in compliance therewith. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, the Adviser recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 
15 


 The Adviser votes all proxies based upon the guiding principle of seeking to maximize the ultimate long-term economic value of our stockholders holdings, and ultimately all votes are cast on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the contractual obligations under the relevant advisory agreements or comparable documents, and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote. The Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although the Adviser generally votes against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, the Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 The Advisers proxy voting decisions are made by our Advisers investment committee. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Adviser will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Advisers investment committee, and disinterested directors, any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how the Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Pursuant to our privacy policy, we will not disclose any non-public personal information concerning any of our stockholders who are individuals unless the disclosure meets certain permitted exceptions under Regulation S-P. We generally will not use or disclose any stockholder information for any purpose other than as required by law. 
 We may collect non-public information about investors, such as name, address, account number and the types and amounts of investments, and information about transactions with us or our affiliates, such as participation in other investment programs, ownership of certain types of accounts or other account data and activity. We may disclose the information that we collect from our stockholders or former stockholders, as described above, only to our affiliates and service providers and only as allowed by applicable law or regulation. Any party that receives this information will use it only for the services required by us and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose. To protect the non-public personal information of individuals, we permit access only by authorized personnel who need access to that information to provide services to us and our stockholders. In order to guard our stockholders non-public personal information, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with applicable law. Non-public personal information that we collect about our stockholders will generally be stored on secured servers. An individual stockholders right to privacy extends to all forms of contact with us, including telephone, written correspondence and electronic media, such as the Internet. 
 Pursuant to our privacy policy, we will provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each investor that details our privacy policies and procedures at the time of the investors subscription. 
 Reporting Obligations 
 We furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 Stockholders and the public may also read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains such information. 
 Election to be Taxed as a RIC 
 We qualify and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending on December 31, 2015. As a RIC, we generally do not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income or gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. Rather, dividends we distribute generally are taxable to our stockholders, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other of our tax attributes generally do not pass through to our stockholders, subject to special rules for certain items such as net capital gains and qualified dividend income we recognize. See  Taxation of U.S. Stockholders and  Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders below. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify as a RIC, we must timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction), which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for each taxable year (the Annual Distribution Requirement). 
 
16 


 Taxation as a RIC 
 As a RIC and if we satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (generally, net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute (or are deemed to timely distribute) to our stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 We generally are subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement). We will not be subject to the U.S. federal excise tax on amounts on which we are required to pay U.S. federal income tax (such as retained net capital gains). Depending upon the level of taxable income earned in a year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay the applicable U.S. federal excise tax. 
 To maintain our status as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 
 

 | qualify and have in effect an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership (as defined in the Code), or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the 90% Income Test); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and

 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in our taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable U.S. federal income tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, that have increasing interest rates or are issued with warrants), we must include in our taxable income in each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether we receive cash representing such income in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in our taxable income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as accruals on a contingent payment debt instrument or deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because such OID or other amounts accrued are included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make distributions to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and/or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will have not received any corresponding cash payments. Accordingly, to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders that will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may need to sell some of our assets at times and/or at prices that we would not consider advantageous, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital or we may need to forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business (or be unable to take actions that are advantageous to our business). If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to enable us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable state and local taxes). 
 Because we expect to use debt financing, we may be prevented by financial covenants contained in our debt financing agreements from making distributions to our stockholders in certain circumstances. In addition, under the 1940 Act, we are generally not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage tests are met. Limits on our distributions to our stockholders may prevent us from satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement and, therefore, may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a RIC, or subject us to the 4% U.S. federal excise tax.

 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we may borrow funds and sell assets in order to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient for us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. However, our ability to dispose of assets may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. Alternatively, although we currently do not intend to do so, to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may declare a taxable dividend payable in our stock or cash at the election of each stockholder. In such case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in our common stock will generally be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of our stock. See  Taxation of Stockholders below for a discussion of the tax consequences to stockholders upon receipt of such dividends. 
 Distributions we make to our stockholders may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of our investments, if necessary. We may recognize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we recognize net capital gains from such transactions, investors may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test for any taxable year or the Diversification Tests for any quarter of a taxable year, we might nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions of the Code applied (which might, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets). If we failed to qualify for treatment as a RIC and such relief provisions did not apply to us, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate U.S. federal income tax rates (and we also would be subject to any applicable state and local taxes), regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. We would not be able to deduct distributions to our stockholders, nor would distributions to our stockholders be required to be made for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any distributions we make generally would be taxable to our U.S. stockholders as ordinary dividend income and, subject to certain limitations under the Code, would be eligible for the 20% maximum rate applicable to individuals and other non-corporate U.S. stockholders, to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, U.S. stockholders that are corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholders adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. 
 Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that re-qualify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized during the 10-year period after our requalification as a RIC, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such net built-in gains at the time of our requalification as a RIC. We may decide to be taxed as a regular corporation even if we would otherwise qualify as a RIC if we determine that treatment as a corporation for a particular year would be in our best interests.
