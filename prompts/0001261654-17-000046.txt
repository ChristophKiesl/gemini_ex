Other target groups for relationship-building, such as parts and tools suppliers, provide us with a variety of strategic and financial benefits that include equipment sponsorship, new product support, licensing and branding opportunities and financial sponsorship for our campuses and students.
Business Strategy 
Our goal is to continue to be the leading provider of post-secondary education for students seeking careers as professional automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine technicians and the leading supplier of entry-level skilled technicians for the industries we serve. We are also broadening our program offerings into high-demand, adjacent skilled trades such as welding and CNC machining technician training. We continue to evolve our business model to provide our students with accessible, affordable training with a focus on bringing education to the students. We intend to pursue the following business strategies to attain these goals:
     Strengthen industry relationships
Our relationships with leading OEMs are important to our business. We deliver value to OEMs and employers by functioning as an efficient hiring source and low cost training option for new and existing technicians. These relationships give us direct input on the latest needs and requirements of employers, which not only guides our prospective student recruitment, but also strengthens our curricula and our students’ opportunities for employment and earnings potential after graduation. In addition, our OEM partners and their related dealers support our students through manufacturer-paid courses, scholarships and tuition reimbursement programs. 
Recruit, train and identify employment opportunities for more students
Our student recruitment efforts are focused on three primary markets for prospective students and are conducted through three admissions channels:
High School: Field-based representatives develop and maintain relationships with high school guidance counselors, teachers and administrators as well as local employers. These representatives generate student interest in pursuing the technician career path and UTI’s training programs through career presentations and workshops at high schools, career fairs and inviting students and their influencers on field trips and tours of our campuses and local employers’ businesses. 
Adult: Campus-based representatives serve adult career-seeking or career changing students who typically inquire with our schools as a result of our advertising campaigns. 
Military: Our military representatives are strategically located throughout the country and focus on building relationships with military installations in order to serve the needs of transitioning soldiers and military veterans. Additionally, we have a centralized team of military representatives who are dedicated to serving and assisting veterans throughout the U.S.
We collaborate with employers to help prospective students and their families understand the potential career opportunities that may be available after completing one of our programs. As competition for the graduates we train grows, employers are increasingly partnering with us to raise awareness of the benefits of a technician career path for prospective students. Employer testimonials are featured in our marketing materials. Additionally, 
3


employers host special events for our prospective students at their locations and participate in open houses at our campuses, highlighting the high-tech jobs and career opportunities available to our graduates.
Our national multi-media marketing strategies are designed to drive new student growth by building brand awareness and differentiation, enhancing the appeal of the skilled trades, and generating inquiries from qualified prospective students.
We continue to optimize our national and local marketing initiatives, tools and systems with the goals of cost-efficiency, balancing the volume and quality of inquiries and attracting prospective students with a high propensity to attend our programs. Partnering with employers and focusing on our marketing strategies is part of an effort to increase positive perception of technical careers and our programs. We are working to build relationships on military bases, in high schools, with local and state businesses and education and policy leaders to educate them on the value we create for our students, local employers, the economy and the community.
We have implemented new processes, technology and tools to support our national network of admissions representatives in responding to new student inquiries and keeping them engaged as they apply for, enroll in and start school. We provide graduate-based incentive compensation for our admissions representatives, which rewards them for students who successfully complete our programs.
Improve educational value proposition and affordability
Educational value
Our strategy is to provide students with an excellent return on their educational investment by working with our industry partners to offer manufacturer-specific training that is tailored to industry standards and requirements, improves students’ opportunities to find employment and maximizes their earnings potential in a secure, growing industry. We actively engage transportation industry partners in defining our core curriculum and improving and expanding MSAT courses. We regularly evaluate program offerings, schedules and locations that are most appealing to students and aligned with employer expectations, and update and expand our core and MSAT courses to align our training programs with current industry requirements.
These unique course offerings make our students more valuable to employers by giving them training that is consistent with industry needs and rapidly changing technology and the opportunity to earn a variety of industry-recognized certifications and credentials. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to better meet the industry’s demand for skilled technicians.
Our Automotive and Diesel Technology II curricula is designed around manufacturers’ needs and fulfills student demand for hands-on, instructor led training in multiple learning environments. We intend to continue integrating this curricula and methodologies at new and existing campuses that offer Automotive and Diesel Technology programs. We will prioritize implementation of the Automotive and Diesel Technology II curricula at new campus locations.
We provide relevant services to assist students with possible tuition financing options, educational and career counseling, opportunities while attending school for part-time work and housing assistance and, ultimately, graduate employment. Our national employment services team develops job opportunities and outreach, while our local employment services teams instruct active students on employment search and interviewing skills, facilitate employer visits to campuses, provide access to reference materials and assist with the composition of resumes.
Affordability
Increased price sensitivity and aversion to debt continue to negatively impact prospective students’ willingness and ability to invest in an education, especially when jobs are plentiful in an economic cycle. We are 
4


working to open more conveniently located campuses that allow students to commute and we provide a flexible curriculum that allows students to work while attending school. We are focused on making our training more affordable and accessible through financing options, proprietary loans, institutional grants and scholarships based on need and merit and employer funded tuition reimbursement; we assist students in applying for any grants or scholarships available for which they meet qualifications and we engage employers in developing tuition reimbursement programs for employees in good standing. We also offer financing tools and guidance for students.
In response to growing demand for trained technicians, our industry partners and employers are increasingly willing to provide our students with scholarship money and to offer our graduates tuition reimbursement plans and competitive compensation and benefit packages, including signing bonuses, relocation grants and toolboxes. These programs make our training more affordable for students and provide tangible examples of the opportunities available to our graduates.
We are working with high schools across the nation to increase course articulation programs, which allow students who have completed courses accredited by the National Automotive Technical Education Foundation (NATEF), a division of the Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), to transfer these credits to our programs. These additional credits can reduce students’ tuition and the time needed to complete our programs.
Additionally, we regularly review and revise key business processes with the goals of eliminating costs and waste, driving efficiency and allowing us to continue to improve value and affordability for our students. Our goal is to align costs with student populations without compromising the quality of our education.
Invest in strategies to return to profitable growth
We are pursuing strategies designed to return to profitable long-term growth and have secured the capital necessary to execute these initiatives, while meeting the requirements and expectations of regulators and our accreditor. 
Through organic growth and, potentially, strategic acquisition of campus locations, we are expanding our national footprint by adding smaller campuses in locations where there is strong demand from students and employers, including those students who would not relocate to one of our existing campuses. Additionally, we are working to more cost effectively and efficiently use our space through reducing the size of and better utilizing our existing campuses, offering new OEM courses, adding complementary skilled trade programs, such as our new welding and CNC machining programs, and through negotiating facility use agreements. 
We are also working to create more diversified revenue streams that build on our expertise in developing training programs for hands-on technical applications. Through strategic acquisition, we are building the capability to develop and deliver digital training and continuing technical education solutions for a variety of domestic and international companies.
Industry Background
The market for qualified service technicians is large and growing. In the most recent data available, the United States Department of Labor (U.S. DOL) estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 749,900 employed automotive technicians in the United States, and this number was expected to increase by 6.3% from 2016 to 2026. Other 2016 estimates provided by the U.S. DOL indicate that the number of technicians in the other industries we serve, including diesel, collision, motorcycle and marine repair, are expected to increase over this ten-year period by 9.5%, 8.7%, 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively. The need for technicians is due to a variety of factors, including technological advancement in the industries into which our graduates enter, a continued increase in the number of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and boats in service, the increasing lifespan of late-model automobiles and light trucks and an aging workforce that has begun to retire. As a result of these factors, the U.S. DOL estimates that an average of approximately 125,600 new job openings will exist annually for new entrants from 2016 to 2026 in 
5


these fields, according to data we reviewed. In addition to the increase in demand for newly qualified technicians, manufacturers, dealer networks, transportation companies and governmental entities with large fleets are outsourcing their training functions, seeking preferred education providers who can offer high quality curricula and have a national presence to meet the employment and advanced training needs of their national dealer networks.
The U.S. DOL estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 404,800 employed welders, cutters, solderers and brazers in the United States, and this number was expected to increase by 5.5% from 2016 to 2026. The U.S. DOL estimates that an average of approximately 45,800 new job openings will exist annually for new entrants from 2014 to 2024 in this field, according to data we reviewed.
The U.S. DOL estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 145,700 employed computer-controlled machine tool operators in the United States, and this number was expected to increase by 1.1% from 2016 to 2026. The U.S. DOL estimates that an average of approximately 14,500 new job openings will exist annually for new entrants from 2016 to 2026 in this field, according to data we reviewed.

Industry Relationships
We have a network of industry relationships that provide a wide range of strategic and financial benefits, including product/financial support, licensing and manufacturer training.

• | Product/Financial Support. Product/financial support is an integral component of our business strategy and is present throughout our schools. In these relationships, sponsors provide their products, including equipment and supplies, at reduced or no cost to us, in return for our use of those products in the classroom. Additionally, they may provide financial sponsorship either to us or to our students. Product/financial support is an attractive marketing opportunity for sponsors because our classrooms provide them with early access to the future end-users of their products. As students become familiar with a manufacturer’s products during training, they may be more likely to continue to use the same products upon graduation. Our product support relationships allow us to minimize the equipment and supply costs in each of our classrooms and significantly reduce the capital outlay necessary for operating and equipping our campuses. 

An example of a product/financial support relationship is: 

◦ | Snap-on Tools. We have a strategic agreement with Snap-on Tools, a premier tool provider to the industries we serve. Upon graduation from our undergraduate programs, students receive a Snap-on Tools entry-level tool set having an approximate retail value of $1,000, which can become valuable as a student establishes their career. We purchase these tool sets from Snap-on Tools at a discount from their list price pursuant to a written agreement which expires in October 2022. In the context of this relationship, we have granted Snap-on Tools exclusive access to our campuses to display tool related advertising, and we have agreed to use Snap-on Tools equipment to train our students. We receive credits from Snap-on Tools for student tool kits that we purchase and any additional purchases made by our students. We can then redeem those credits in multiple ways, which historically has been to purchase Snap-on Tools equipment and tools for our campuses at the full retail list price. The renewal executed in October 2017 also allows us to redeem our credits for a portion of the tool sets we purchase. 


• | Licensing. Licensing agreements enable us to establish meaningful relationships with key industry brands. We pay a licensing fee and, in return, receive the right to use a particular industry participant’s name, logo or trademark in our promotional materials and on our campuses. We believe that our current and potential students generally identify favorably with the recognized brand names licensed to us, enhancing our reputation and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. 

An example of a licensing arrangement is: 

◦ | NASCAR. We have a licensing arrangement with NASCAR and we are its exclusive education provider for automotive technicians. The agreement expires on December 31, 2024 and may be terminated for cause by either party at any time prior to its expiration. This relationship provides us with access to the network of NASCAR sponsors, presenting us with the opportunity to enhance our product support relationships. In July 2002, NASCAR Technical Institute opened in Mooresville, North Carolina where students have the opportunity to take NASCAR-specific elective courses that were developed through a collaboration of NASCAR crew chiefs and motorsports industry leaders. The popular NASCAR brand name combined with the opportunity to learn on high-performance cars is a powerful recruiting and retention tool. It also provides students with the opportunity to learn first-hand with NASCAR engines and equipment and to acquire specific skills required for entry-level positions in automotive and racing-related career opportunities.

• | Manufacturer Training. Manufacturer training relationships provide benefits to us that impact each of our education programs. These relationships support entry-level training tailored to the needs of a specific manufacturer, as well as continuing education and training of experienced technicians. In both the entry-level and continuing education programs, students receive training on a given manufacturer’s products. In return, the manufacturer supplies vehicles, equipment, specialty tools and parts at reduced prices or at no charge and assistance in developing curricula. Students who receive the entry-level training may earn manufacturer certification to work on that manufacturer’s products when they complete the program. The manufacturer certification typically leads to both improved employment opportunities and the potential for higher wages. The continuing education programs for experienced technicians are paid for by the manufacturer and often take place in our facilities, allowing the manufacturer to avoid the costs associated with establishing its own dedicated facility. Manufacturer training relationships lower the capital investment necessary to equip our classrooms and provide us with a significant marketing advantage. In addition, through these relationships, manufacturers are able to increase the pool of skilled technicians available to service and repair their products. 

Examples of manufacturer training relationships include: 

◦ | Nissan North America, Inc. This is an example of a student-paid MSAT program. We offer the Nissan Automotive Technician Training elective program at our Houston, Texas; Long Beach, California; Mooresville, North Carolina and Orlando, Florida campuses. The Nissan Program uses training and course materials as well as training vehicles and equipment provided by Nissan North America Inc. 


◦ | American Honda Motor Co., Inc. This is an example of a dealer technician training program paid for by the manufacturer or dealer. We provide marine and motorcycle training for experienced American Honda technicians utilizing training materials and curricula provided by American Honda. Our instructors provide marine and motorcycle dealer training at American Honda-authorized training centers across the United States. Additionally, American Honda supports our campus Hon Tech training program by donating equipment and providing curricula. 


◦ | Porsche Cars of North America, Inc. This is an example of a manufacturer-paid MSAT program. We have a written agreement with Porsche Cars of North America, Inc. whereby we provide the Porsche Technician Apprenticeship Program at the Porsche training centers in Atlanta, Georgia and Easton, Pennsylvania using vehicles, equipment, specialty tools and curricula provided by Porsche. The written agreement expires September 30, 2019 and may be renewed by mutual agreement. 


• | Industry Employer Incentives. OEM and non-OEM large national employers of our graduates compete for newly trained technicians to fill their technician shortage. In response to this, industry employers have worked with us to create more comprehensive recruitment and retention strategies which benefit our students and graduates. The strategies continue to evolve, but common techniques include tuition reimbursement programs (TRIP) for qualifying students and graduates, where employers pay back some or all of a graduate's student loan, as well as tool incentives, relocation packages, mentorship programs and part-time employment opportunities while attending school. Tuition reimbursement amounts range from $1,000 to full student loan reimbursement. This industry support lowers the cost for students to attend our programs and begin their careers as technicians

13


while also allowing industry employers to increase the pool of skilled technicians to fill their open positions.
Examples of industry employer incentives include:

◦ | Penske Automotive Group. Penske Automotive Group offers tuition reimbursement, tool reimbursement and tenure bonuses. 


◦ | AutoNation. AutoNation's Eastern Region offers tuition reimbursement and relocation assistance, or a sign-on bonus and tool allowance.


◦ | Crown Lift Trucks. Crown Lift Trucks offers tuition reimbursement.


◦ | Ryder Systems, Inc. Ryder Systems, Inc. offers tuition reimbursement, a quarterly incentive program and a new hire mentorship program. 

Student Recruitment Model
Our student recruitment efforts begin with our commitment to positive outcomes, both for our students and our industry relationships. Our responsibility to present job-ready graduates to employers requires that we recruit, enroll and train prospective students who have the drive and potential to successfully pursue a career in their field of training. We use a multi-touch media approach that involves national and local outreach to generate the quality and quantity of prospective students necessary for our three primary admissions channels to enroll and start students.
Marketing and Advertising. Our marketing strategies are designed to identify potential students who would benefit from our programs and pursue successful careers upon graduation. We leverage an integrated inquiry generation platform that focuses on generating awareness and engagement, both nationally and locally, where our website acts as the primary hub of our campaigns, to inform and educate potential students on the nature and cost of our educational programs and the employment opportunities that could be available to them. Currently, we advertise on television, internet search, social media, display, online video and other internet-based content, radio and in magazines. We use events, sponsorships, social media, direct mail, email, texting and telephonic response to reach prospective students.
Recruitment. Our recruiting policy is intended to maximize the efficiency of our admissions representatives by focusing on the students most likely to succeed in our programs and in their chosen field. Our admissions representatives are provided with training and tools to assist any prospective student.

• | High School Students. Our field-based representatives recruit prospective students primarily from high schools across the country with assigned territories covering the United States and U.S. territories. Our field-based admissions representatives generate the majority of their inquiries by making career presentations at high schools. Typically, the field-based admissions representatives enroll high school students during an application interview conducted at the homes of prospective students. 

Our reputation in local, regional and national business communities, endorsements from high school instructors and guidance counselors and the recommendations of satisfied graduates and employers are some of our most effective recruiting tools. Accordingly, we strive to build relationships with the people who influence the career decisions of prospective students, such as vocational instructors and high school guidance counselors. We conduct seminars for high school career counselors and instructors at our training facilities and campuses as a means of further educating these individuals on the merits of our technical training programs. We also participate in national skills competitions 
14


as judges and offer STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) curriculum integration assistance to secondary education instructors. Our representatives focus on expanding high school relationships and increasing access to high schools beyond the traditional vocational programs and into academic classes. Our programs align with STEM principles, and we actively work to increase this awareness in high school educators and prospective students. We offer a summer program at certain campuses for high school students who are entering their junior or senior year. This program allows the student to take a specific course, or courses, in advance of enrolling in a UTI program. When the student enrolls and starts in a full-time program at one of our campuses, he or she receives credit for the courses previously completed. 

• | Military Personnel. Our military representatives are strategically located throughout the country and focus on building relationships with military installations. Additionally, we have a centralized team of military representatives who are dedicated to serving and assisting veterans throughout the U.S. We develop relationships with military personnel and provide information about our training programs by delivering career presentations to transitioning service members who are approaching their date of separation or have recently separated from the military as a means of further educating these individuals on the merits of our technical training programs. We continue to offer introductory motorcycle mechanics classes at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. These classes are designed to introduce motorcycle theory to active military personnel and expose them to the opportunity to transfer to an MMI campus to complete their program after they are discharged from the military. This continues to be part of our ongoing initiative to serve the needs of transitioning veterans and military personnel. 


• | Adult Students. Our campus-based representatives recruit adult career-seeker or career-changer students. These representatives respond to student inquiries generated from national, regional and local advertising and promotional activities. Since adults tend to start our programs throughout the year instead of in the fall as is most typical of traditional school calendars or for recent high school graduates, these students help balance our enrollment throughout the year. 

Student Admissions and Retention
We currently employ field, military and campus-based admissions representatives who work directly with prospective students to facilitate the enrollment process. Enrollment applications are reviewed by a central enrollment office for accuracy and completion before students are enrolled into the program of study. Different programs have varying admissions standards. 
Applicants must provide proof of one of the following: high school graduation or its equivalent; certification of high school equivalency (G.E.D. or approved State Equivalency Exam); successful completion of a degree program at the postsecondary level or successful completion of officially recognized home schooling. Certain states require official transcripts or G.E.D. test scores instead of the certificates. 
To maximize the likelihood of student retention and graduation, our admissions process is intended to identify students who have the desire and ability to succeed in their chosen program. We have student services professionals and other resources that provide various student services, including orientation, tutoring, student housing assistance, and academic, financial, personal and employment advisement. We have established processes to identify students who may be in need of assistance to succeed in and complete their chosen program. 
Enrollment
We enroll students throughout the year and courses start every three to six weeks. For the year ended September 30, 2017, our average undergraduate full-time student enrollment was approximately 10,900, representing a decrease of approximately 9.2% as compared to 12,000 for the year ended September 30, 2016. Currently, our student body is geographically diverse, with approximately 50% of our students having relocated 
15


to attend our programs. Due to the seasonality of our business and normal fluctuations in student populations, we would expect volatility in our quarterly results. See "Seasonality" within Part II, Item 7 of this Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating results.
Graduate Employment
As described in “Business - Schools and Programs” included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K, our programs prepare graduates for careers in industries using the training we provide, primarily as automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle, marine and CNC machining technicians and as welders. Identifying employment opportunities and preparing our graduates for these careers is critical to our ability to help our graduates benefit from their education.  Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective employment team. Our campus-based staff facilitates several career development processes, including instruction and coaching for interview skills, interview etiquette and professionalism. Additionally, the employment team provides students with reference materials and assistance with the composition of resumes. Finally, we place emphasis on and devote significant time to assisting students with part-time and graduate job searches. 
We also have a centralized department whose focus is to build and maintain relationships with potential and existing national employers and develop graduate job opportunities and, where possible, relocation assistance, sign-on bonuses, tool packages and tuition reimbursement plans with our OEMs and other industry employers. Together, the campuses and centralized department coordinate and host career fairs, industry awareness presentations, interview days and employer visits to our campus locations. We believe that our graduate employment services provide our students with a compelling value proposition and enhance the employment opportunities for our graduates. 
Our employment rate for 2016 and 2015 graduates who were employed within one year of graduation was 86% and 88%, respectively. The employment calculation is based on all graduates, including those that completed MSAT programs, from October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016 and October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2015, respectively, excluding graduates not available for employment because of continuing education, military service, medical reasons, incarceration, death or international student status. We count a graduate as employed based on a verified understanding of the graduate’s job duties to assess and confirm that the graduate’s primary job responsibilities are in his or her field of study. We verify employment by sending written verification requests to the graduate and/or the employer. The verifications must include employer name, job duties, job title, hire date and employer contact. Once we receive written verification from either source, the graduate is classified as employed in field as long as all verification requirements are met. In instances where we are unable to obtain written verification, we also classify graduates as employed in field if we are able to obtain verbal verification, collecting the same information as noted above, from both the graduate and the employer. We periodically review a sample of employment verifications to ensure accuracy.
For 2016, we had approximately 9,200 total graduates, of which approximately 8,600 were available for employment. Of those graduates available for employment, approximately 7,400 were employed within one year of their graduation date, for a total of 86%. For 2015, we had approximately 9,700 total graduates, of which approximately 9,100 were available for employment. Of those graduates available for employment, approximately 8,000 were employed within one year of their graduation date, for a total of 88%. For discussion of current year graduate employment results, see See “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Graduate Employment” included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K.
Faculty and Employees 
Faculty members are hired nationally in accordance with established criteria, applicable accreditation standards and applicable state regulations. Members of our faculty are primarily industry professionals and are hired based on their prior work and educational experience. We require a specific level of industry experience in order to enhance the quality of the programs we offer and to address current and industry-specific issues in the 
16


course content. We provide intensive instructional training and continuing education to our faculty members to maintain the quality of instruction in all fields of study. A majority of our existing instructors have a minimum of five years experience in the industry and an average of eight years of experience teaching at UTI, ranging from less than 1 year to 33 years. Our average undergraduate student-to-teacher ratio is approximately 19-to-1. 
Each school’s support team typically includes a campus president, an education director, a financial aid director, a student services director, an employment services director, a controller and a facilities director. As of September 30, 2017, we had approximately 1,730 full-time employees, including approximately 520 student support employees and approximately 640 full-time instructors.
Our employees are not represented by labor unions and are not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, employees who desire to seek union representation at new or existing campuses. We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 
Competition 
The for-profit, post-secondary education industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no one provider controlling significant market share. We compete with other institutions that are eligible to receive Title IV funding, including not-for-profit public and private schools, community colleges and all for-profit institutions which offer automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine technician training as well as other skilled trades training programs. Our competition differs in each market depending on the curriculum that we offer and the availability of other choices, including job prospects. Our main competitors for the programs we provide are local community colleges, mainly due to local accessibility and low tuition rates. There is no single community college that is a significant competitor; rather, the sector as a whole provides competition. Within the for-profit career-oriented and technical school sector, some of our national and regional competitors include programs offered by Lincoln Technical Institute, WyoTech, Tulsa Welding and University of Northwestern Ohio. On November 8, 2017, Zenith Education Group announced that it plans to cease enrolling new students and will teach out its programs with existing students at all three WyoTech campuses. We consider other single location institutions, with a larger local presence near one of our campuses, as competitors as well. Additionally, the military often recruits or retains potential students when branches of the military offer enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act increased enlistment targets for the Army, Guard, and the Reserve. Prospective students may also choose to forego additional education and enter the workforce directly, especially during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable as it has in recent years. This may include employment with our industry partners or with other manufacturers and employers of our graduates. Competition is generally based on location, tuition rates, the type of programs offered, the quality of instruction and instructional facilities, graduate employment rates, reputation and recruiting. Public institutions are generally able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools.
According to provisional data available through the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, we had 8,972 graduates; Lincoln Technical Institute had 3,349 graduates; University of Northwestern Ohio had 1,158 graduates and WyoTech had 1,262 graduates in programs similar to ours. This data also shows that no individual community college had a number of graduates commensurate with ours in similar programs. Further, we partner with over 30 OEMs to provide manufacturer specific advanced training. We believe that we have the largest number of OEM branded training programs. These OEMs provide vehicles, equipment, specialty tools and curricula that lead to increased training and employment opportunities for our students, including the potential for brand specific certifications. For additional information regarding the benefits of the relationships with OEMs, see “Business - Business Model” and “Business - Business Strategy” included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. We believe that our industry relationships, brand recognition and national presence provide significant benefits to our students, our graduates and their employers while differentiating us from other technical training schools.

Environmental Matters
We use hazardous materials at our training facilities and campuses and generate small quantities of regulated waste, including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, paint, solvents and car batteries. As a result, our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. Certain of our campuses are required to obtain permits for our air emissions. In the event we do not maintain compliance with any of these laws and regulations, or if we are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages, and fines or penalties.

See Note 17 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Report on Form 10-K for summary segment financial information.
Regulatory Environment
Our institutions participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs that assist students in paying their cost of education. The largest source of such support is the federal programs of student financial assistance under Title IV of the HEA. This support, commonly referred to as Title IV Programs, is administered by ED. In 2017, we derived approximately 71% of our revenues, on a cash basis as defined by ED, from Title IV Programs, as calculated under the 90/10 rule.
To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be authorized to offer its programs of instruction by relevant state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED and be certified as an eligible institution by ED. To participate in veterans' benefits programs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the Reserve Education Assistance Program (REAP), and VA Vocational Rehabilitation, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA. Additionally, certain states and their 
18


attorneys general require additional authorization to operate our institutions or for our students to receive state funding. Furthermore, we are subject to oversight by other federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury, Labor and Justice. For these reasons, our institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by all of these entities.
State Authorization and Regulation
Each of our institutions must be authorized by the applicable state education agency where the institution is located to operate and offer a postsecondary education program to its students. Our institutions are subject to extensive, ongoing regulation by each of these states. Additionally, our institutions are required to be authorized by the applicable state education agencies of certain other states in which our institutions recruit students. Currently, each of our institutions is authorized by the applicable state education agency or agencies. 
The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state and is extensive in some states. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and equipment, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, student outcomes reporting, disclosure obligations to students, limitations on mandatory arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award certificates, diplomas or degrees. Some states prescribe standards of financial responsibility that are not consistent with those required by ED and some mandate that institutions post surety bonds. Currently, we have posted surety bonds on behalf of our institutions and admissions representatives with multiple states of approximately $21.4 million. We believe that each of our institutions is in substantial compliance with state education agency requirements. 
States often change their requirements in response to ED regulations or to implement requirements that may impact institutional and student success, and our institutions must respond quickly to remain in compliance. Also, from time to time, states may transition authority between state agencies and we must comply with the new state agency’s rules, procedures and other documentation requirements. Changes in state requirements have resulted in changes to our recruiting and other operations in those states and have increased our costs of doing business. If any one of our campuses were to lose its authorization from the education agency of the state in which the campus is located, that campus would be unable to offer its programs and we could be forced to close that campus. If one of our campuses were to lose its authorization from a state other than the state in which the campus is located, that campus would not be able to recruit students in that state.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution voluntarily submits to ongoing qualitative reviews by an organization of peer institutions. Accrediting commissions examine the academic quality of the institution’s instructional programs, and a grant of accreditation is generally viewed as confirmation that the institution’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards and practices. Accrediting commissions also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources necessary to perform its educational mission, implement continuous improvement processes and support student success.
19


Accreditation by an ED-recognized commission is required for an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs. In order to be recognized by ED, an accrediting agency must adopt specific standards for its review of educational institutions and must undergo a periodic process for renewal of its ED recognition.  The renewal process begins with a review and analysis by ED staff of written application materials submitted by the accrediting agency. The application materials and ED’s staff analysis are then submitted to the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) for consideration. 
All of our institutions are accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC), a national accrediting agency recognized by ED.  In August 2016, NACIQI recommended that ED renew its recognition of ACCSC for a period of five years; in October 2016, ED accepted this recommendation and renewed ACCSC's recognition for a period of five years.
We believe that each of our institutions is in substantial compliance with ACCSC accreditation standards. If any one of our institutions lost its accreditation, students attending that institution would no longer be eligible to receive Title IV Program funding, we could lose our state authorization in states that require accreditation and we could be forced to close that institution. Our campuses' grants of accreditation expire as detailed below; a school that is faithfully engaged in the renewal of accreditation process and is meeting all of the requirements of that process continues to be accredited if the school's term of accreditation has exceeded the period of time last granted by ACCSC.

* Our Long Beach, California campus accreditation expired in September 2017. We completed the renewal site visit for accreditation in April 2017; refer to additional discussion below.
** Schools that achieve School of Excellence status after July 1, 2015 are awarded a six-year team of accreditation. 
The procedures of our accrediting agency for the renewal of accreditation of a campus require a team of professionals to conduct an on-site visit at the campus and issue a Team Summary Report, which includes an assessment of the school’s compliance with accrediting standards.  On July 20, 2017, we received a Team Summary Report from the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) that summarized three findings from its visit to our Long Beach, California campus in connection with renewing the campus’ accreditation.  The first finding related to the campus’ application for a hybrid-distance education model, which is used in several programs.  The second finding related to the campus’ application of ACCSC’s standards for the calculation of credit hours.  The third finding related to the campus’ application of certain aspects of its leave of absence policy. 
20


Under ACCSC procedures, we submitted our response to the Team Summary Report on August 29, 2017. ACCSC has indicated that our response will be considered at the November 2017 meeting. If ACCSC determines our responses or remedial efforts are sufficient, it may close the findings and provide a five year renewal of accreditation for the Long Beach, California campus. If ACCSC ultimately determines our responses or remedial efforts are insufficient, program accreditation and Title IV awards for students at our campuses could be negatively impacted.
On July 20, 2017, we also received the Team Summary Reports that summarize the findings from the renewal of accreditation evaluations for our Norwood, Massachusetts and Sacramento, California campuses. One of the programs at the Norwood campus did not meet the graduation benchmark set by ACCSC as a result of a small number of students in the program. We anticipate discontinuing this program and we submitted our response to the Team Summary Report on August 4, 2017. One of the programs at the Sacramento campus did not meet the employment benchmark set by ACCSC; this program has since met the benchmark. We submitted our response to ACCSC on August 29, 2017. We are continuing to implement initiatives designed to improve our graduation and employment rates.
In June 2017, our Exton, Pennsylvania and Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas campuses received the “School of Excellence” designation by ACCSC. The School of Excellence Award recognizes ACCSC-accredited institutions for their commitment to the expectations and rigors of ACCSC accreditation, as well as the efforts made by the institution in maintaining high-levels of achievement among their students. In order to be eligible for the School of Excellence Award, an ACCSC-accredited institution must meet the conditions of renewing accreditation without any finding of non-compliance, satisfy all requirements necessary to be in good standing with ACCSC and demonstrate that the majority of the schools’ student graduation and graduate employment rates for all programs offered meet or exceed the average rates of graduation and employment among all ACCSC-accredited institutions.  Institutions are only eligible for the School of Excellence designation in the year in which they complete a renewal of accreditation. Our Avondale, Arizona; Phoenix, Arizona; Rancho Cucamonga, California; Lisle, Illinois; Mooresville, North Carolina and Houston, Texas campuses have previously received School of Excellence designation in the year in which they were eligible. 
In March 2017, ACCSC conducted an unannounced site visit at our Houston, Texas campus. One program in the automotive division did not achieve the graduation benchmark set by ACCSC and was placed on heightened monitoring status effective June 9, 2017, which will involve a detailed review of the school's Annual Report submission. We are continuing to implement retention strategies designed to improve our graduation rates.
Our 2017 annual report has been completed and submitted to ACCSC. Nine of our approximately 145 approved programs did not meet the graduation rate requirements, the employment rate requirements, or both. The majority of the programs that were below the benchmark requirements did not meet the requirements as a result of a small number of students in the program. Two of the nine programs had already been discontinued prior to reporting. We anticipate that an additional four of the nine programs below benchmark will be discontinued. Consistent with our goal of providing our students with an excellent return on their investment, we are eliminating longer programs that have minimal enrollment and higher cost to students. ACCSC may require additional reporting regarding these programs or institutions, and the program or institution could be at risk of a show cause or other adverse action that could lead to sanctions, including but not limited to loss of accreditation of the program or institution. An institution placed on reporting status is required to report periodically to ACCSC on that institution’s performance in the area or areas specified by ACCSC. In June 2017, we implemented enhanced internal reporting to provide earlier visibility to cohort outcomes, which will allow us to respond quickly to early indications of risk.
Nature of Federal and State Support for Postsecondary Education
The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through Title IV Programs in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible to participate by ED. Most aid under Title IV Programs is awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can 
21


reasonably contribute to that cost. All recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain a satisfactory grade point average and make academic progress, as defined by ED, towards the completion of their program of study as well as meet other eligibility requirements. In addition, each institution must ensure that Title IV Program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students, as well as provide a variety of disclosures and reports on recipient data and program expenditures.
During 2017, based on their individual eligibility under the following Title IV Programs, our students received grants and loans from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) program, the Federal Pell Grant (Pell) program, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program and the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins) program. 
Federal Title IV Programs
DL. Under the DL program, ED makes loans to students or their parents. Borrowers repay these loans to ED according to the terms and conditions of the program. Students with financial need continue to qualify for interest subsidies on subsidized loans while in school up through 150% of the published length of the student's program. Students with subsidized loans also qualify for interest subsidies while in the 6-month grace period and during periods of deferment. Students with unsubsidized loans do not qualify for interest subsidies. Non-need-based unsubsidized loans are also available to students or their parents. In 2017, we derived approximately 55% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the DL program. 
Pell. Under the Pell program, ED makes grants to students who demonstrate financial need based on the federal Free Application for Federal Student Aid. In 2017, we derived approximately 16% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Pell program. 
FSEOG. FSEOG grants are designed to supplement Pell grants for students with the greatest financial need. Institutions must provide matching funding equal to 25% of all awards made under this program. In 2017, we derived less than 1% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the FSEOG program. 
Perkins. Perkins loans are made from a revolving institutional account in which 75% of new funding is capitalized by ED and the remainder by the institution. Each institution is responsible for collecting payments on Perkins loans from its former students and lending those funds to currently enrolled students. Defaults by students on their Perkins loans reduce the amount of funds available in the institution’s revolving account to make loans to additional students. Since the federal award year beginning July 1, 2004, ED has made no new Perkins allocations to institutions due to federal appropriations limitations. In 2017, we derived less than 1% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Perkins program. 
The Federal Perkins Loan Program had previously been subject to a September 30, 2015 end date. On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 into law, which allowed an extension of the program to make loans to undergraduate borrowers until September 30, 2017, after which point new Perkins loans will be prohibited. ED has provided guidance on the wind-down of the program.
Other Federal and State Programs
Some of our students receive financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as the programs administered by the VA, the Department of Defense (DOD) and under the Workforce Investment Act. Additionally, some states provide financial aid to our students in the form of grants, loans or scholarships. The eligibility requirements for federal and state financial aid vary by funding agency and program. 
Since June 2012, institutions participating in the Cal Grant program funded by the state of California are required to achieve a three-year cohort default rate of less than 15.5% and a graduation rate above 30% to remain eligible for the Cal Grant program. As a result of their respective cohort default rates, our Universal Technical 
22


Institute of Phoenix institution, which includes our Sacramento, California campus, and our Universal Technical Institute of Arizona institution, which includes our Rancho Cucamonga, California and Long Beach, California campuses, became ineligible for the Cal Grant program with the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 award years, respectively. In 2016, the rate for our Universal Technical Institute of Arizona institution fell below the Cal Grant ceiling of 15.5%, which enabled us to renew participation in the Cal Grant program at our Rancho Cucamonga campus and establish new participation at our Long Beach campus beginning with the 2017-2018 award year. 
Veterans' Benefits. Since October 1, 2011, the Post-9/11 GI Bill has been effective for both degree and non-degree granting institutions of higher learning, allowing eligible veterans to use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at all of our institutions. Additionally, veterans use benefits such as the Montgomery GI Bill, the REAP and VA Vocational Rehabilitation at our campuses. We derived approximately 19% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from veterans' benefits programs in 2016. To participate in veterans' benefits programs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the REAP, and VA Vocational Rehabilitation, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA. These criteria require, among other things, that the institution: 

• | report on the enrollment status of eligible students;


• | maintain student records and make such records available for inspection;


• | follow current VA rules; and


• | comply with applicable limits on the percentage of students receiving certain veterans benefits on a program and campus basis.

If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could lose our eligibility to participate in veterans' benefits programs.
The VA imposes limitations on the percentage of students per program receiving benefits under certain veterans’ benefits programs, unless the program qualifies for certain exemptions. If the VA determines that a program is out of compliance with these limitations, the VA will continue to provide benefits to current students, but new students will not be eligible to use their veterans benefits for an affected program until we demonstrate compliance. 
The VA shares responsibility for VA benefit approval and oversight with designated State Approving Agencies (SAAs).  SAAs play a critical role in evaluating institutions and their programs to determine if they meet VA benefit eligibility requirements.  Processes and approval criteria as well as interpretation of applicable requirements can vary from state to state. Therefore, approval in one state does not necessarily result in approval in all states.  If we are unable to secure approvals in one or more states, or if the process for obtaining an approval takes significant time, we could be required to alter the delivery methodology or structure of the program or experience delays in or the loss of a portion of VA funding. Students receiving VA funding may not have the same flexibility in scheduling their coursework. 
During 2012, President Obama signed an Executive Order directing the DOD, Veterans Affairs and Education to establish “Principles of Excellence” (Principles), based on certain guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, to apply to educational institutions receiving federal funding for service members, veterans and family members. As requested, we provided written confirmation of our intent to comply with the Principles to the VA in June 2012. We are required to comply with the Principles to continue recruitment activities on military installations. Additionally, there is a requirement to possess a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the U.S. DOD as well as with certain individual installations. Our access to bases for student recruitment has become more limited due to recent changes in the Transition Assistance Program (Transition Goals, Plans, Success) and increased enforcement of the MOU requirement. Each of our institutions has an MOU with the U.S. DOD. We have MOUs with certain key individual installations and are pursuing MOUs at additional locations; however, 
23


some installations will not provide MOUs to institutions that do not teach at the installation. We continue to strengthen and develop relationships with our existing contacts and with new contacts in order to maintain and rebuild our access to military installations. 
Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs
To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be authorized to offer its programs by the relevant state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED and be certified as eligible by ED. ED will certify an institution to participate in Title IV Programs only after the institution has demonstrated compliance with the HEA and ED’s extensive regulations regarding institutional eligibility. An institution must also demonstrate its compliance to ED on an ongoing basis. All of our institutions are certified to participate in Title IV Programs. 
ED’s Title IV program standards are applied primarily on an institutional basis, with an institution defined by ED as a main campus and its additional locations, if any. Each institution is assigned a unique Office of Post-Secondary Education Identification Number (OPEID). Under this definition for ED purposes we have the following three institutions:

Institution | 
 | Universal Technical Institute of Arizona 
Main campus | 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Avondale, Arizona 
Additional campuses | 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Lisle, Illinois 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Long Beach, California 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Rancho Cucamonga, California
 | NASCAR Technical Institute, Mooresville, North Carolina 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Norwood, Massachusetts

Institution | 
 | Universal Technical Institute of Texas 
Main campus | 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Houston, Texas 
Additional campuses | 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Exton, Pennsylvania 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas

The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed through Title IV Programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in those programs and instances of fraud and abuse have prompted ED to exercise significant regulatory oversight over institutions participating in Title IV Programs. Accrediting commissions and state agencies also oversee compliance with both their respective standards and certain Title IV Program requirements. As a result, each of our institutions is subject to detailed oversight and review and must comply with a complex framework of laws and regulations. Because ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretation of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV Program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
Significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include the following:
Congressional Action. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV Programs. Congress has historically reauthorized the HEA approximately every five to six years. The HEA was reauthorized, amended and signed into law most recently on August 14, 2008; a new reauthorization process has begun with hearings and draft legislation in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Congress reviews and determines federal appropriations for Title IV Programs at least annually. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 established the CFPB, which became active during 2012. The CFPB is tasked with overseeing large banks and certain other types of nonbank 
25


financial companies, including alternative loan providers, for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. It is possible that our proprietary loan program will be subject to such review. 
Incentive Compensation. In 2010, ED issued revised regulations pertaining to incentive compensation, which became effective July 1, 2011. The new regulations eliminated the 12 safe harbors in the former regulations, and provide that an institution participating in Title IV Programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. When it issued the regulations, ED also stated that it does not intend to provide private guidance to individual institutions on their specific compensation practices, but that it may issue additional broadly applicable guidance to all institutions from time to time. 
The revised incentive compensation regulations and the ED guidance that accompanied the revised regulations when they were issued in 2010 prohibited institutions from:

• | making salary adjustments to covered employees based, in any part, directly or indirectly, on the employee’s success in securing enrollments or financial aid, or the number of students recruited, enrolled or awarded financial aid;


• | providing any payments or incentives to covered employees based on students’ graduation or completion of any part of their program, although, as discussed below, ED recently issued new revised guidance regarding graduation and completion-based compensation; and


• | paying any incentives to covered employees based on how many students receive jobs in their field of study after graduation.

The compensation restrictions apply to any employee who undertakes recruiting or admitting of students, or who makes decisions about and awards Title IV Program funds, as well as any higher level employee with responsibility for recruitment or admission of students, or making decisions about awarding Title IV Program funds. Furthermore, the regulations state that the same restrictions on an institution’s payments to its own individual employees will also be applied with limited exceptions to an institution’s payments to an outside company engaged in certain admissions, recruiting or financial aid activities.
ED published guidance in November 2015 that eliminated certain restrictions on incentive compensation for admissions representatives. Specifically, ED reconsidered its previous interpretation and stated that its regulations do not prohibit compensation for admissions representatives that is based upon students’ graduation from, or completion of, educational programs. Compensation based on enrolling students continues to be prohibited. ED also stated that in assessing the legality of a compensation structure, ED will evaluate whether compensation labeled as graduation-based or completion-based compensation is in substance enrollment-based compensation. We have made adjustments to the compensation practices for our admissions representatives which we believe comply with ED's November 2015 guidance. The transition period for the new compensation structure will continue through calendar year 2018. We will continue to evaluate other compensation options under these regulations and guidance.
Because the regulations differ significantly from the prior regulations, and because of the imprecise nature of many aspects of these regulations and ED's published guidance, it is not clear how ED will apply these regulations in all circumstances. Although we cannot guarantee that ED will not take a position that some aspect of our compensation practices is not in compliance with these regulations, we believe that our compensation plans are in substantial compliance with the regulations. ED's revisions to the regulations continue to adversely affect our ability to compensate our employees and our compensation practices for third parties. 
26


Gainful Employment. The HEA generally requires for-profit institutions to provide programs of training that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation in order for the students enrolled in those programs to qualify for Title IV Program assistance. 
On October 31, 2014, ED published final gainful employment regulations which established additional Title IV Program eligibility requirements on certain educational programs required to lead to gainful employment.
Most parts of the new rule were effective on July 1, 2015, with the exception of new disclosure requirements that were intended to replace prior disclosure requirements and were originally scheduled to take effect on a later date as discussed below. 
On June 16, 2017, ED announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the gainful employment regulations. ED has announced that the committee will convene in December 2017 and in early 2018 and issue proposed regulations for public comment during the first half of 2018, but ED has not established a final schedule for publication of proposed or final regulations. Any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2018 typically would take effect in July 1, 2019, but we cannot provide any assurances as to the timing or content of any such regulations.
On June 30, 2017, ED announced the extension of the compliance date for certain gainful employment disclosure requirements from July 1, 2017 to July 1, 2018. ED stated that institutions are still required to comply with other gainful employment disclosure requirements by July 1, 2017. On August 18, 2017, ED announced in the Federal Register new deadlines for submitting notices of intent to file alternate earnings appeals of gainful employment rates and for submitting alternate earnings appeals of those rates. The deadline to file a notice of intent to file an appeal is October 6, 2017 and the deadline to file the alternate earnings appeal is February 1, 2018. ED has not announced a delay or suspension in the enforcement of any other gainful employment regulations. However, on August 8, 2017, ED officials announced that ED did not have a timetable for the issuance of completer lists to schools, which is the first step toward generating the data for calculating new gainful employment rates. Consequently, we cannot predict when ED will begin the process of calculating and issuing new draft or final gainful employment rates in the future.  We also cannot predict whether the announcement of the intent to initiate gainful employment rulemaking or the extension of certain gainful employment deadlines may result in ED delaying the issuance of new draft or final gainful employment rates in the future.
The following is a summary of the key elements of the final rule that took effect on July 1, 2015.
Applicability
The final rule applies to all of our Title IV eligible programs intended by the HEA to lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation. ED uses two DE calculations to compare the debt incurred by each program’s Title IV recipients to their annual earnings following graduation. Specifically, our programs will qualify under the gainful employment rules if we can establish that the program meets at least one of the following two annual DE metrics:

• | annual debt to earnings rate (aDTE) which requires that the estimated median annual loan payment of a particular cohort of graduates not exceed eight percent of the higher of the mean or median earnings of those graduates, based on earnings information obtained by ED from the Social Security Administration (SSA).


• | discretionary debt to income rate (dDTE) which requires that the estimated median annual loan payment of a particular cohort of graduates not exceed 20 percent of the estimated discretionary income of those graduates. Discretionary income for this purpose is the higher of the mean or median annual earnings of the cohort less 1.5 times the poverty guideline for a single person as determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

27


Measurement Standards
The gainful employment rule provides a three tier rating system of pass, zone and fail:

• | Pass: Program meets at least one of the DE metrics.


• | Zone: Program passes neither DE metric, but is in the "zone" under at least one of the DE metrics, which is defined as having an aDTE between eight and 12 percent or a dDTE between 20 and 30 percent. The program's other metric may be failing.


• | Fail: Program fails both DE metrics, meaning the program has an aDTE greater than 12 percent and a dDTE greater than 30 percent.

A program becomes ineligible for Title IV if it fails both DE tests in two out of any three consecutive years for which rates are calculated. In addition, any program that measures in the zone or has a combination of zone/failing scores for four consecutive years would become ineligible for Title IV. If a program loses eligibility or is voluntarily discontinued after receiving draft zone or failing DE rates, the institution may not reestablish eligibility for that program or a substantially similar program, as defined in the regulations, for a period of three years.
The rule includes a transition period, which varies in duration between five and seven years depending on the length of the particular program. During the transition period, an institution's programs may be evaluated using an alternative DE calculation that uses the debt incurred by a more recent cohort of graduates. The transition period is intended to allow an institution to improve its DE rates by taking steps to reduce the debt of its recent student cohorts; however, at least for the first year of the transition period, the calculation will still use debt incurred by students who graduated before the rule took effect.
 The rule provides an institution with the opportunity to challenge certain elements of the DE calculations. However, such challenges will be subject to a compressed timeline. Challenges to the earnings calculations will be extremely limited and likely involve considerable expense to the institution. The rule grants ED substantial discretion to establish procedures, requirements and standards for the challenges.
 In January 2017, ED issued to our schools final versions of the first set of DE rates to be issued under the new rule. Under these final DE rates for the 2015 debt measure year, none of our programs had failing rates. Nine of our 12 educational programs achieved passing rates, and the other three programs were in the zone. The three programs in the zone are the Collision Repair, Automotive, and Motorcycle programs at our Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix institution, which includes our MMI Phoenix, Arizona and Orlando, Florida campuses and our Sacramento, California campus. All of the programs at our Universal Technical Institute of Arizona and Universal Technical Institute of Texas institutions had passing final DE rates. With respect to future DE rates, we are not able to develop reliable projections of our programs' performance under the final rule because we do not have access to the SSA earnings data that is used in the calculations. Additionally, on August 8, 2017, ED officials announced that ED did not have a timetable for the issuance of completer lists to schools, which is the first step toward generating the data for calculating new gainful employment rates. Consequently, we cannot predict when ED will begin the process of calculating and issuing new draft or final gainful employment rates in the future. 
If a particular program ceased to be eligible for Title IV Program funding, in most cases it would not be practical to continue offering that program under our current business model. In order to prevent this, we may have to explore mitigation strategies which might include preemptively reducing program tuition in an attempt to ensure compliance. Because we cannot calculate the exact impact of such action on a program's DE rates, we may overestimate the required tuition reduction, which would have a negative impact on our tuition revenues. Conversely, we may underestimate the required tuition reduction, and fail to improve the program's DE rates, which could result in the loss of Title IV eligibility as discussed above.
28


Certification
The rule requires an institution's most senior executive officer to certify, as a condition of continued Title IV Program eligibility, that each of the institution’s eligible gainful employment programs satisfies certain new ED certification requirements that focus primarily on the approval of the program by relevant regulatory or governing bodies such as institutional accreditors and, if applicable, programmatic accreditors and state licensing agencies.
Disclosure
The rule identifies up to 16 different items, as determined by ED, that institutions must disclose to prospective students and the public about each of their programs, using a disclosure template provided by ED, while providing ED the right to expand the list as it deems necessary. ED issued a disclosure template in January 2017 for institutions to provide required disclosures and required institutions to begin using the template by April 3, 2017. In March 2017, ED extended the deadline for use of the new template to July 1, 2017. The template requires institutions to provide various data for each of its programs, including, among other things, program cost, length, on-time graduation rates, placement rates, percentage of students who borrow to pay for program, typical student debt and monthly payment, typical graduate earnings, and typical fields of employment. Until July 1, 2017, institutions were required to continue to comply with the existing disclosure requirements previously described. In June 2017, ED announced that institutions would be required to provide a completed disclosure template, or a link thereto, on its gainful employment program web pages by July 1, 2017, but would not be required until July 1, 2018 to include the disclosure template, or a link thereto, in the gainful employment program promotional materials and to directly distribute the disclosure template to prospective students prior to enrollment.
Reporting
The rule requires institutions to annually report to ED information required to calculate the DE rates and certain potential disclosure items, including information about the institution's gainful employment programs, the enrollment status of students in those programs and the debt incurred by those students.
Warnings
The rule requires institutions to provide disclosures to all prospective students prior to their signing an enrollment agreement, obtain verification of receipt from the student and maintain historical records of such verification. The rule further requires institutions to provide separate warnings with respect to any program that ED identifies as in jeopardy of losing Title IV eligibility when the next set of DE rates becomes final. If required, these warnings must be provided to all active and prospective students and the institution must maintain records that document its efforts to distribute the warning. Warnings must include a number of elements including a statement that the program has not met ED’s gainful employment standards and Title IV eligibility may be terminated, options available to the student should Title IV eligibility be lost and guidance on the institution’s plans to continue the program, offer refunds, or transfer credit should Title IV eligibility be lost. Based on our final DE rates for the 2015 debt measurement year, none of our programs are currently required to provide these separate warnings.
Defense to Repayment Regulations. On November 1, 2016, ED published final regulations in the Federal Register regarding, among other things, the ability of borrowers to obtain discharges of their obligations to repay certain Title IV loans and the circumstances that require institutions to provide letters of credit or other financial protection to ED. The regulations had a general effective date of July 1, 2017. In June 2017, ED announced a delay until further notice in the effective date of the majority of these regulations. ED also announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to revise the regulations on borrower defenses to repayment of Federal student loans and other matters published on November 1, 2016. On October 24, 2017, ED published an interim final rule that delayed until July 1, 2018 the effective date of the majority of these regulations. On the same date, ED also published a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed to further delay, until July 1, 2019, the effective date of the majority of the regulations to ensure that there is adequate time 
29


to conduct negotiated rulemaking and, as necessary, develop revised regulations. ED provided the public until November 24, 2017 to submit comments to its proposal. ED convened the first meeting of negotiated rulemaking in November 2017 and is scheduled to continue additional meetings into early 2018. ED intends to issue proposed regulations for public comment during the first half of 2018, but ED has not established a final schedule. Any regulations published in final form by November 1, 2018 typically would take effect on July 1, 2019, but we cannot provide any assurances as to the timing or content of any such regulations or whether and when ED might end the delay in the effective date of the previously published regulations. The following is a summary of the key elements of the final rule that was published on November 1, 2016.
Borrower Defense and Other Discharges
The new regulations establish amended procedures and standards for borrowers, either individually or as a group, to assert through an ED-administered process a defense to the borrowers’ obligation to repay certain Title IV loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017 based on certain acts or omissions of the institution that relate to the making of the loan for enrollment at the school or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided that would give rise to a cause of action against the school. The effective date of the majority of the Borrower Defense and Other Discharges regulations was delayed until July 1, 2018 and ED proposed to further delay the effective date until July 1, 2019 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on October 24, 2017. 
The regulations also expand the types of defenses available for borrowers, either individually or as a group, to assert through a new ED-administered process for loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017 based on certain acts or omissions that relate to the making of a Direct Loan for enrollment at the school or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided and which fall into one of the following categories: 

• | The borrower, whether as an individual or as a member of a class, or a governmental agency, has obtained against the school a nondefault, favorable contested judgment based on state or federal law in a court of administrative tribunal.


• | The institution failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student.


• | The school or any of its representatives or any institution, organization, or person with whom the school has an agreement to provide educational programs, or to provide marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services, made a substantial misrepresentation (as defined by ED regulations) that the borrower reasonably relied on to the borrower’s detriment when the borrower decided to attend, or to continue attending, the school or decided to take out a Direct Loan. The rules also expand the existing regulatory definition of a misrepresentation. 

The regulations establish separate procedures for claims initiated for individual borrowers and claims initiated for groups of borrowers as well as separate procedures in the event that the institution is open or closed. The rules establish varying, borrower-favorable statutes of limitations for the initiation of claims and, in some cases, impose an unlimited statute of limitations. The procedures provide for evaluation of the claims either by an ED official or hearing official and provide for school participation in the process. The procedures in some cases enable ED to consolidate borrower claims with common facts and to present the borrowers’ claims during the process.
If the ED official or hearing official approves the borrower’s defense to repayment through the applicable administrative process established in the proposed regulations, ED may discharge the borrower’s obligation to repay some or all of the borrower’s student loans, may return to the borrower amounts already paid by the borrower toward the discharged portion of the loan, and may initiate a separate proceeding to collect the discharged and returned amounts from the institution.
30


Financial Protection Requirements
The new regulations revise the financial responsibility regulations to expand the list of actions or events that would require an institution to provide ED with a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and potentially be subject to other conditions and requirements. The specified list of events is extensive and includes events that ED contends might result in actual or potential debts, liabilities or losses and other events that ED contends might result in the institution being unable to meet all of its financial obligations and otherwise provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with the Title IV programs. The new regulations require institutions to notify ED and current and prospective students within specified timeframes of the occurrence of one or more of these events. The effective date of the Financial Protection Requirements was delayed untilJuly 1, 2018 and ED proposed to further delay the effective date until July 1, 2019 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on October 24, 2017.
With respect to events that might result in actual or potential debts, liabilities or losses, the new regulations identify the following events that could result in ED deeming the institution to fail ED’s financial responsibility standards and requiring a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and the acceptance of other conditions or requirements:

• | the institution is required to pay any debt or incur any liability arising from a final judgment in a judicial proceeding or from an administrative proceeding or determination, or from a settlement;


• | the institution is being sued in an action that has been pending for 120 days and that was brought by a federal or state authority for financial relief on claims related to making a Direct Loan for enrollment at the institution or the provision of educational services;


• | the institution is being sued in other litigation and the institution’s motion for summary judgment has been denied or was not filed with the court;


• | the institution is closing any or all of its locations and is required by its accrediting agency to submit a teach-out plan;


• | the institution has one or more gainful employment programs with gainful employment rates that could result in the programs becoming ineligible based on their rates for the next award year; or


• | if the institution’s composite score is less than 1.5, any withdrawal of owner’s equity from the institution occurs by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the transfer is to an entity included in the affiliated entity group on whose basis the institution’s composite score was calculated.

If one or more of these events occur, ED recalculates the institution’s composite score by estimating the amount of actual and potential losses resulting from the events and determining whether the recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 and the institution fails the financial responsibility standards as a result. The regulations establish severe rules for calculating and presuming the recognition of the potential losses that might arise from the above-referenced events. For example, with certain exceptions, the regulations estimate the potential losses from pending lawsuits to equal the amount of relief claimed in the complaint or in any final written demand letter from the claimant. With respect to closing locations and to programs that could lose eligibility based on gainful employment rates, the regulations estimate potential losses to equal the amount of Title IV funds received by the institution for the location and programs during the most recently completed award year. For a withdrawal of owner’s equity, the regulations estimate potential losses to equal the amount transferred to an entity other than the institution. 
The new regulations could require us to submit a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and accept other conditions or requirements if we pay dividends to shareholders if our composite score 
31


is less than 1.5 and the dividend amounts in combination with estimated losses associated with other events covered by the rules would reduce our composite score below 1.0 as recalculated by ED. On June 24, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC, pursuant to which Coliseum purchased shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Under the related Certificate of Designations, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue from the date of original issuance at a rate of 7.5% per annum on the liquidation preference then in effect (Cash Dividend). If we do not declare and pay the dividend, the liquidation preference will be increased to an amount equal to the liquidation preference in effect at the start of the applicable dividend period plus an amount equal to such then applicable liquidation preference multiplied by 9.5% per annum (Accrued Dividend). Cash Dividends, if declared, are payable semi-annually in arrears on September 30 and March 31, of each year. If applicable, the Accrued Dividend will begin to accrue and be cumulative on the same schedule as set forth above for Cash Dividends and will also be compounded on each applicable subsequent dividend date. Consequently, our inability to pay dividends on a timely basis could increase the cost of paying those dividends when they are paid in the future.
The regulations also identify the following events that ED contends might result in the institution being unable to meet all of its financial obligations and otherwise provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with the Title IV programs, and that could result in ED deeming the institution to fail ED’s financial responsibility standards, thus requiring a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection and the acceptance of other conditions or requirements: failure to comply with the 90/10 Rule for the most recently completed fiscal year; SEC warning that it may suspend trading on the institution’s stock; failure to file certain reports with the SEC; the exchange on which the institution’s stock is traded notifying the institution that it is not in compliance with exchange requirements or that its stock is delisted; cohort default rates of at least 30 percent for its two most recent rates; certain significant fluctuations in Title IV funding; certain citations for failure to comply with state agency requirements; failure to comply with yet to be developed ED financial stress tests; high annual dropout rates; placement of the institution on probation or issuance of a show-cause or similar action by its accrediting agency; certain violations of loan agreements; expected or pending claims for borrower relief discharges and certain other events that ED might identify as reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or results of operations of the institutions. 
If ED deems the institution to fail the financial responsibility standards based on one or more of the aforementioned events listed in the regulations or based on the institution’s failure to comply with other requirements in the financial responsibility regulations, ED may permit the institution to continue participating in the Title IV programs under a provisional certification and would require the institution to submit a letter of credit or other form of financial protection, comply with the zone requirements and potentially accept other conditions or restrictions. The regulations state that the letter of credit must equal 10 percent of the total amount of Title IV funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year plus any additional amount that ED determines is necessary to fully cover any estimated losses unless the institution demonstrates that the additional amount if unnecessary to protect, or is contrary to, the Federal interest. The regulations state that ED maintains the full amount of financial protection until ED determines that the institution has a composite score of 1.0 or greater based on a review of the institution’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year in which all losses from the aforementioned events have been fully recognized or if the recalculated composite score is 1.0 or greater and the aforementioned events have ceased to exist.
Student Loan Repayment Rates
The new regulations require proprietary institutions with student loan repayment rates, as defined in the regulations, below prescribed thresholds to provide an ED-prepared warning to prospective and enrolled students, as well as placement of the warning on its website and in all promotional materials and advertisements. The effective date of the Student Loan Repayment Rate regulations was delayed until July 1, 2018 and ED proposed to further delay the effective date until July 1, 2019 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on October 24, 2017.
32


Prohibition on Pre-Dispute Contractual Provisions
The new regulations prohibit the use and reliance upon certain contractual provisions regarding dispute resolution processes, such as pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers, and require certain notifications, contract provisions and disclosures by institutions regarding students’ ability to participate in certain class action lawsuits or to initiate certain lawsuits instead of through arbitration. The rules require institutions to submit to ED copies of certain records in connection with any claim filed in arbitration by or against the school concerning a borrower defense claim and any claim filed in a lawsuit by the school against the student or by any party against the school concerning a borrower defense claim. The effective date of the Prohibition on Pre-Dispute Contractual Provisions was delayed until July 1, 2018 and ED proposed to further delay the effective date until July 1, 2019 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on October 24, 2017.
Other Regulations. On August 25, 2017, ED announced its plans to convene two public hearings in September and October 2017 for the purpose of seeking input on ED regulations related to postsecondary education that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement or modification. The hearings are in accordance with a February 24, 2017 executive order that, among other things, directed federal agencies to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the agency head regarding their repeal, replacement or modification. On June 22, 2017, ED published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting written comments from the public to inform its Task Force's evaluation of all of ED's existing regulations and guidance. The public hearings are designed to supplement this effort. ED has convened two negotiated rulemaking committees with one committee considering proposed regulations related to borrower defense to repayment and financial responsibility matters and another committee considering proposed regulations related to gainful employment. 
The “90/10 Rule.” A for-profit institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years as calculated under a cash basis formula mandated by ED. The HEA and ED regulations set forth specific requirements for the calculation of the Title IV Program revenue percentage, mandate expanded disclosure requirements in how an institution presents the calculation and impose negative consequences if an institution exceeds the 90% limit in a single fiscal year.
The HEA provides that an institution will lose its Title IV Program eligibility for a period of at least two institutional fiscal years if it exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive institutional fiscal years. The loss of such eligibility would begin on the first day following the conclusion of the second consecutive year in which the institution exceeded the 90% limit and, as such, any Title IV Program funds already received by the institution and its students during a period of ineligibility would have to be returned to ED or a lender, if applicable. Additionally, if an institution exceeds the 90% level for a single year, ED will place the institution on provisional certification for a period of at least two years, could impose other restrictions or conditions on the institution's Title IV eligibility, and, under ED’s amended financial responsibility regulations that were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017, but have now been delayed until July 1, 2018 and may be delayed until July 1, 2019 under a proposal published by ED on October 24, 2017, could conclude that the institution lacks financial responsibility and is required to submit a letter of credit or other form of financial protection. 
The HEA sets specific standards for certain elements in the calculation of an institution’s percentage under the 90/10 Rule, including, among other things, the treatment of institutional loans and revenue received from students who are enrolled in educational programs that are not eligible for Title IV Program funding. 
33


As of September 30, 2017, our institutions’ annual Title IV percentages as calculated under the 90/10 rule ranged from approximately 68% to 73%. We regularly monitor compliance with this requirement to minimize the risk that any of our institutions would derive more than the allowable maximum percentage of its revenue from Title IV Programs for any fiscal year.
Federal Student Loan Defaults. To remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, institutions must maintain federal student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. ED calculates an institution’s cohort default rate on an annual basis. Under the current calculation, the cohort default rate is derived from student borrowers who first enter loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (FFY) ending September 30 and subsequently default on those loans within the two following years; parent borrowers are excluded from the calculation. This represents a three-year measuring period. An institution whose cohort default rate is 30% or more for three consecutive FFYs or greater than 40% for any given FFY loses eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs. This sanction is effective for the remainder of the FFY in which the institution lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent FFYs. None of our institutions had a three-year cohort default rate of 30% or greater for 2014, 2013 or 2012, the three most recent FFYs with published rates.
The following tables set forth the FFEL/DL cohort default rates for our institutions: 

 | Three-Year Cohort Default Rates for 
Institution | Cohort Years Ended September 30, (1)
 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 
Universal Technical Institute of Arizona | 13.9% | 14.5% | 17.1%
Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix | 18.3% | 18.9% | 18.9%
Universal Technical Institute of Texas | 15.8% | 18.6% | 18.3%
All proprietary postsecondary institutions | 15.5% | 15.0% | 15.8%
(1) Based on information published by ED. 

An institution whose three-year cohort default rate is 15% or greater for any one of the three preceding years is subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers. As of September 30, 2017, all of our institutions were subject to delayed disbursements. An institution whose cohort default rate is 30% or greater, but less than or equal to 40%, for two of the three most recent federal fiscal years may be placed on provisional certification status by ED for up to three years. Under ED’s financial responsibility regulations that were amended with an effective date of July 1, 2017, but that were delayed until July 1, 2018 and may be delayed until July 1, 2019 under a proposal published by ED on October 24, 2017, an institution whose two most recent official cohort default rates are 30 percent or greater may fail ED’s financial responsibility regulations and be required to submit a letter of credit or other financial protection and be subject to other conditions and restrictions. 
Perkins Loan Defaults. An institution with a Perkins program cohort default rate that is greater than 15.0% for any federal award year, which is the twelve month period from July 1 through June 30, may be placed on provisional certification.The most recent Perkins cohort default rates reported by our institutions is based on Perkins borrowers who entered repayment during the federal award year ended June 30, 2016, who then defaulted on their Perkins loans prior to July 1, 2017. The resulting 2015-2016 Perkins cohort default rates for Universal Technical Institute of Arizona and Universal Technical Institute of Texas were 12.5% and 9.09% respectively. The Perkins cohort default rate for Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix for the same period was 10%, based on 2 of 20 Perkins borrowers defaulting in this cohort period. However, because there were fewer than 30 Perkins loan 
34


borrowers who entered repayment during the 2015-2016 period for this institution, ED requires a consolidation of the three most recently reported Perkins data to calculate an official Perkins cohort default rate. The resulting 3-year consolidation for Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix resulted in 7 of 33 defaulted Perkins borrowers, or a default rate of 21.21%. Although this Perkins 3-year consolidated cohort default rate is greater than 15% for Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix, we have not been advised of any provisional certification status. If we are placed on provisional certification status for any reason, ED will require us to obtain prior approval for changes to our programs and locations and may more closely view any application we file for recertification, new locations, new or revised educational programs, acquisitions of other institutions, increases in degree level or other significant changes. Further, for an institution that is provisionally certified, ED may revoke the institution’s certification without advance notice or advance opportunity to challenge the action. 
An institution with a Perkins cohort default rate of 50% or greater for three consecutive federal award years loses eligibility to participate in the Perkins program and must liquidate its loan portfolio. None of our institutions had a Perkins cohort default rate of 50% or greater for any of the last three federal award years. ED also will not provide any additional federal funds to an institution for Perkins loans in any federal award year in which the institution’s Perkins cohort default rate is 25% or greater. None of our institutions has had its federal Perkins funding eliminated for the past three federal award years. For the federal award year ended June 30, 2017, as with the 13 preceding federal award years, ED will not disburse any new federal funds to any institutions for Perkins loans due to federal appropriations limitations. In our 2017 fiscal year, we derived less than 1% of our revenues from the Perkins program. The Perkins program was ended by Congress for new loans to undergraduate students effective September 30, 2017; thus no new Perkins loans will be made. 
Financial Responsibility Standards. All institutions participating in Title IV Programs must satisfy specific ED standards of financial responsibility. ED evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards each year, based on the institution’s annual audited financial statements, as well as following a change of control of the institution.
The institution’s financial responsibility is measured by its composite score which is calculated by ED based on three ratios:

• | the equity ratio which measures the institution’s capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability;


• | the primary reserve ratio which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and


• | the net income ratio which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit.

ED assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. ED then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, meet all of its financial obligations including required refunds to students and any Title IV Program liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, comply with certain past performance requirements and not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. If ED determines that an institution does not satisfy its financial responsibility standards, depending on the resulting composite score and other factors, that institution may establish its financial responsibility on an alternative basis.
If an institution's composite score is below 1.5, but is at least 1.0, the institution is in a category classified by ED as the zone. Under ED regulations, institutions in the zone solely because their composite score is less than 1.5 are still considered to be financially responsible, but require additional oversight by ED in the form of cash monitoring and other participation requirements. Institutions in the zone typically are permitted by ED to continue 
35


to participate in the title IV programs under one of two alternatives:  1) the “Zone Alternative” under which an institution is required to make disbursements to students under a payment method other than ED’s standard repayment, typically the Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (HCM1) payment method; to notify ED within 10 days after the occurrence of certain oversight and financial events and to comply with other operating conditions imposed by ED or 2) submit a letter of credit to ED equal to at least 50 percent of the Title IV funds received by the institutions during the most recent fiscal year.  ED permits an institution to participate under the “Zone Alternative” for a period of up to three consecutive fiscal years.  Under the “Zone Alternative” notification requirement, the institution must provide timely information to ED regarding any of the following oversight and financial events:

• | any adverse action, including a probation or similar action, taken against the institution by its accrediting agency, state authority or other federal agency;


• | any event that causes the institution to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the institution's most recent audited financial statements;


• | any violation by the institution of any loan agreement;


• | any failure of the institution to make a payment in accordance with its debt obligations that results in a creditor filing suit to recover funds under those obligations;


• | any withdrawal of owner's equity/net assets from the institution by any means, including by declaring a dividend;


• | any extraordinary losses as defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; or


• | any filing of a petition by the institution for relief in bankruptcy court.

Under the new regulations that were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017, but that ED delayed until July 1, 2018 and that ED has proposed delaying until July 1, 2019 under a proposal published by ED on October 24, 2017, the list of information that an institution must provide timely to ED would change to the following: any event that causes the institution, or a related entity, to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the institution’s or related entity’s most recent audited financial statements or any losses that are unusual in nature and infrequently occur or both as defined in accordance with certain specified accounting standards. The institution also would be required to notify ED of certain other events described in the new Defense to Repayment regulations. See “Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs - Defense To Repayment Regulations.” ED could impose a letter of credit or other conditions or requirements upon us in response to the reporting of any oversight or financial events.
Under the HCM1 payment method, the institution is required to make Title IV disbursements to eligible students and parents before it requests or receives funds for the amount of those disbursements from ED.  As long as the student accounts are credited before the funding requests are initiated, an institution is permitted to draw down funds through ED’s electronic system for grants management and payments for the amount of disbursements made to eligible students.  Unlike the Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (HCM2) or reimbursement payment methods, the HCM1 payment method typically does not require institutions to submit documentation to ED and wait for ED approval before drawing down Title IV funds. ED may place an institution that is in the zone on the HCM2 or reimbursement methods of payment. An institution on the HCM1, HCM2 or reimbursement payment methods must pay any credit balances due to a student or parent before drawing down funds from ED for the amount of disbursements made to the student or parent.
If an institution's composite score is below 1.0, the institution is considered by ED to lack financial responsibility. If ED determines that an institution does not satisfy ED's financial responsibility standards, depending on its composite score and other factors, that institution may establish its financial responsibility on an alternative basis by, among other things:
36



• | posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year, or


• | posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of such prior year's Title IV Program funds, accepting provisional certification for a period of no more than three years, complying with additional ED notification and operating requirements and conditions and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than ED's standard advance funding arrangement.

If an institution is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, the institution may be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on operations and loss of external financial aid funding. See "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K for additional information. If an institution does not establish its financial responsibility by the end of the period for which ED provisionally certified the institution, ED may continue to provisionally certify the institution, but may require one or more persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, as defined by ED regulations, to provide ED with financial protection for an amount determined by ED and to be jointly and severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the institution’s participation in the Title IV programs.
ED published final regulations that were scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2017, but that ED delayed until July 1, 2018 and has proposed delaying until July 1, 2019 under a proposal published by ED on October 24, 2017, that would amend the financial responsibility regulations to expand the list of actions or events that require an institution to provide ED with a letter of credit or other form of acceptable financial protection. The regulations also, among other things, may increase the amount of the letter of credit or other form of financial protection that an institution must provide to ED if the institution has a composite score below 1.0, no longer qualifies for the Zone Alternative, or does not comply with other applicable requirements of the financial responsibility regulations. The regulations also would permit ED to recalculate an institution’s composite score to account for its estimate of actual or potential losses resulting from certain events identified in the new Defense to Repayment Regulations. See “Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs - Defense To Repayment Regulations.”
ED has historically evaluated the financial condition of our institutions on a consolidated basis based on the financial statements of Universal Technical Institute, Inc. as the parent company. ED’s regulations permit ED to examine the financial statements of Universal Technical Institute, Inc., the financial statements of each institution and the financial statements of any related party. For our 2017 fiscal year, we calculated our composite score to be 2.2. However, the composite score calculations and resulting requirements imposed on our institutions are subject to determination by ED once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements. 
Return of Title IV Funds. An institution participating in Title IV Programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing them. The institution must return those unearned funds to ED or the appropriate lending institution in a timely manner, which is generally within 45 days from the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn.
If an institution is cited in an audit or program review for returning Title IV Program funds late for 5% or more of the students in the audit or program review sample, the institution must post a letter of credit in favor of ED in an amount equal to 25% of the total Title IV Program funds that should have been returned in the previous fiscal year. Our 2017 Title IV compliance audits did not cite any of our institutions for exceeding the 5% late payment threshold.
Institution Acquisitions. When a company acquires an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by ED. Upon such a change of control, an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs is generally suspended until it has applied for recertification by ED as an eligible institution under its new ownership, which requires that the institution also re-establish its state authorization and accreditation. ED may temporarily and provisionally 
37


certify an institution seeking approval of a change of control under certain circumstances while ED reviews the institution’s application. The time required for ED to act on such an application may vary substantially. ED’s recertification of an institution following a change of control is typically on a provisional basis. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to acquire additional institutions and have them certified by ED to participate in Title IV Programs following affirmation of state licensure and accreditation. Although we believe we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals from ED, ACCSC and the applicable state and federal agencies for our expansion plans, we cannot ensure that such approvals will be obtained at all or in a timely manner that will not delay or reduce the availability of Title IV Program funds for our students.
Change of Control. In addition to institution acquisitions, other types of transactions can also cause a change of control. ED and most state education agencies and ACCSC have standards pertaining to the change of control of institutions, but these standards are not uniform. ED’s regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution’s parent corporation. With respect to a publicly-traded corporation, ED regulations provide that a change of control occurs in one of two ways: (i) if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control or (ii) if the corporation has a “Controlling Stockholder”, as defined in ED regulations, that owns or controls through agreement at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder. These change of control standards are subject to interpretation by ED. Most of the states and our accrediting commission include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control. A change of control under the definition of these agencies would require any affected institution to have its state authorization and accreditation reaffirmed by that agency. The requirements to obtain such reaffirmation from the states and our accrediting commission vary widely.
A change of control could occur as a result of future transactions in which our company or our institutions are involved. Some corporate re-organizations and some changes in the board of directors are examples of such transactions. Additionally, the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. If a future transaction would result in a change of control of our company or our institutions, we would pursue all necessary approvals from ED, ACCSC and the applicable federal and state agencies. However, we cannot ensure that all such approvals can be obtained at all or in a timely manner that will not delay or reduce the availability of Title IV Program funds for our students.
Opening Additional Institutions and Adding Educational Programs. For-profit educational institutions must be authorized by their state education agencies, accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED and be fully operational for two years before applying to ED to participate in Title IV Programs. However, an institution that is certified to participate in Title IV Programs may establish an additional location and apply to participate in Title IV Programs at that location without regard to the two-year requirement, if such additional location satisfies all other applicable ED eligibility requirements. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to open new campuses as additional locations of our existing institutions and take into account ED’s approval requirements. Currently, all of our institutions are eligible to offer Title IV Program funding. 
A student may use Title IV Program funds only to pay the costs associated with enrollment in an eligible educational program offered by an institution participating in Title IV Programs. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to add new educational programs at our existing institutions. Generally, an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, and is not provisionally certified, may add a new educational program without ED approval if the new program is licensed by the applicable state agency, accredited by an agency recognized by ED, prepare students for gainful employment in the same or related occupation as an educational program that ED has already approved, and meets certain other requirements. For programs required to lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, which includes all of our programs, the institution must also certify that the new program:
38



• | is approved by a recognized accrediting agency or is otherwise included in the institution's accreditation by its recognized accrediting agency;


• | is programmatically accredited if such accreditation is required by a federal government entity or by a governmental entity in the state in which the institution is located or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain state approval; and


• | in the state in which the institution is located, or in which the institution is otherwise required to obtain state approval, satisfies the applicable education prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in that state so that a student who completes the program and seeks employment in that state qualifies to take any licensure or certification examination that is needed for the student to practice or find employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter.

Some of the state education agencies and ACCSC also have requirements that may affect our institutions’ ability to open a new location, establish an additional location of an existing institution or begin offering a new or revised educational program. We do not believe that these standards will create significant obstacles to our expansion plans. 
Administrative Capability. ED assesses the administrative capability of each institution that participates in Title IV Programs under a series of separate standards listed in the regulations. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead ED to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, require the institution to repay Title IV Program funds, change the method of payment of Title IV Program funds or place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its continued participation or take other actions against the institution. 
Eligibility and Certification Procedures. The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV Programs. Every educational institution seeking Title IV Program funding for its students must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Each institution must apply to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs before its current term of certification expires, or if it undergoes a change of control. Terms of certification are typically six years, but can be three years or shorter. Furthermore, an institution may come under ED review if it expands its activities in certain ways such as opening an additional location or raising the highest academic credential it offers. The Program Participation Agreement (PPA) document serves as ED’s formal authorization of an institution and its associated additional locations to participate in Title IV Programs for a specified period of time. Universal Technical Institute of Texas was recertified in February 2012 and entered into a new PPA with ED which will expire March 31, 2018. 
In December 2016, we were advised by ED that our applications for Title IV program participation recertification with respect to our Universal Technical Institute of Arizona and Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix institutions had been processed. The Universal Technical Institute of Arizona institution has received its program participation agreement, which places the institution on provisional certification until March 31, 2018, based on an open ED program review from April 2015 for which we had not received a report at the time of review. As a result of the institution's placement on provisional certification, ED requires that we apply for and receive approval prior to awarding or disbursing Title IV aid for any new locations or new programs. ED may more closely review any application we file for recertification, new locations, new or revised educational programs, acquisitions of other institutions, increases in degree level or other significant changes. Furthermore, for an institution that is provisionally certified, ED may revoke the institution's certification without advance notice or advance opportunity to challenge the action. In March 2017, we received a standard, non-provisional program participation agreement for the Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix institution with an expiration date of March 31, 2018. This timeframe has been designed to allow for participation alignment of all three of our institutions. We will submit recertification applications for all of our institutions in December 2017 as required.

Compliance with Regulatory Standards and Effect of Regulatory Violations. Our institutions are subject to audits and program compliance reviews by various external agencies, including ED, ED’s Office of Inspector General, state education agencies, student loan guaranty agencies, the VA and ACCSC, as well as other federal and state agencies. Each of our institutions’ administration of Title IV Program funds must also be audited annually by independent accountants and the resulting audit report submitted to ED for review. If ED or another regulatory agency determined that one of our institutions improperly disbursed Title IV Program funds or violated a provision of the HEA or ED’s regulations, that institution could be required to repay such funds and could be assessed an administrative fine. ED could also transfer the institution from the advance method of receiving Title IV Program funds to a cash monitoring or reimbursement system, which could negatively impact cash flow at an institution. Significant violations of Title IV Program requirements by us or any of our institutions could be the basis for a proceeding by ED to fine the affected institution or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the affected institution in Title IV Programs. Generally, such a termination extends for 18 months before the institution may apply for reinstatement of its participation. 
In April 2015, ED completed an ordinary course program review of our administration of the Title IV programs in which we participate for our Avondale, Arizona institution main campus and additional locations of that institution. The site visit covered the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 award years. An initial program review report dated September 22, 2017 has been issued by ED. The report contains nine findings that are not material because they are limited to errors identified in individual student records and to requests to update and strengthen certain financial aid-related disclosures and procedures. None of the findings require us to perform any retroactive file reviews of all of our students for any issues for any time period. This matter is not yet final. We provided our response to ED within the stated deadline of 30 days from the date we received the report.  ED will review and take into consideration our response to the report before issuing its final program review determination letter. ED has not indicated how long it will take to review our response and issue the final program review determination letter.
As previously disclosed, during a review of our methodology for assessing compliance with the 90/10 Rule, we determined that it would be appropriate to revise the manner in which we treat certain stipends, primarily those awarded to recipients of veterans benefits. The revision, which did not impact our current or historical compliance with the 90/10 rule, related to the application of technical regulatory guidance in a circumstance where a student has multiple sources of tuition funding including Title IV funds and a portion of those funds is used as a stipend. In August 2015, we provided this information to ED and requested guidance from ED on any additional procedures they might require. We received a letter from ED in September 2015 requesting additional documentation in connection with revisions to our methodology for performing prior year 90/10 calculations. We provided the requested documentation in September 2015 and have not received a further response from ED. 
In connection with the issuance of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) in June 2016, we received a request from ED to provide a monthly student roster and a biweekly cash flow projection. We began complying with these reporting requirements in July 2016. 
There is no ED proceeding pending to fine any of our institutions or to limit, suspend or terminate any of our institutions' participation in Title IV Programs, and we have no written notice that any such proceeding is currently contemplated. Violations of Title IV Program requirements could also subject us or our institutions to other civil and criminal penalties.
