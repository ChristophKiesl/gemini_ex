Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
Extract Pharmaceuticals Inc (“the Company”) is a US-based development stage company that is in the process of acquiring certain Intellectual Property (“IP”) for chewing gum as a medicinal delivery system for several ailments. 
 The Company intends to identify and acquire patents and IPs that further its aim to provide medical solutions to a great number of everyday ailments using medicated (functional) chewing gum instead of pills as a drug delivery method.
 
The Company investigated much raw data which shows that patients who are unable to swallow their medicines are an overlooked problem and can have dire consequences for the patients in question. The University of South Florida conducted a survey that indicated as much as 40% of U.S. adults have difﬁculties swallowing their medication. Additionally, approximately 14% have delayed taking doses of their medication, 8% have skipped a dose and 4% have discontinued taking

their medication altogether. More than 75% of those having difﬁculties taking their pills never tell their physician of their problem. 

Obviously, non-adherence and failure of patients to inform their doctors of their difﬁculties with taking their medication can result in serious health consequences. The patients must endure illnesses that could be easily remedied. Common headaches, snifﬂes, allergies or inﬂammations become major issues, and instead of a nearly instantaneous cure, the patient must suffer entire sick days or even weeks. 
 Management is currently working on obtaining IP that furthers the use of chewing gum as a medicinal delivery system. At this preliminary stage, we foresee economic applicability for use of chewing gum for antihistamines, vitamins, painkillers, and any other kind of common ailments that millions suffer from every day.

Concept Analytics forecasted an uninterrupted 15% annual increase in the market for well-being chewing gum, rapidly expanding this $700 million market (Gale Goliath) for at least the next five years. 

Presently management is focused on nutrition and health chewing gum with natural based ingredients, but have already drafted working plans on expanding the product line with gums having medical effects such as painkillers and antihistamine medications. We expect to conclude our first IP acquisition within the next fiscal quarter.
