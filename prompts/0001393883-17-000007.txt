2016 Highlights
2016 Progress on Key Strategic Goals: Path of Innovation, Integration and Evolution
In 2016, we made significant progress against our key strategic goals, as well as on our new strategy. Now with our tech-focused strategy, we’re placing an even greater emphasis on key brands which satisfy employers with technology hiring needs.
We’ve enjoyed a steady stream of enhancements to our products and services, leading to deeper engagement with professionals and clients. Through a concerted focus on technology solutions, we’re addressing the challenges customers experience finding and hiring highly-skilled professionals. We’ve established the Company as a trusted partner to employers and as a provider of relevant, tailored career insights for professionals.
Company Profile
DHI was incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2005. DHI is a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections through our specialized services for professional communities including technology and security clearance, financial services, energy, healthcare and hospitality. Each of our services is tailored for the specific industry or profession it serves. We focus on delivering three key value propositions:

• | Providing the most efficient solution for recruiters and employers;


• | Delivering the most relevant career content in our verticals; and


• | Utilizing data and analytics to deliver specialized insights.

 5

The majority of our revenues today are generated through the sale of recruitment packages, which allow customers to post jobs and source candidates through our resume databases and, in the case of Dice, Dice Europe and eFinancialCareers, to utilize our Open Web search service for an additional fee. Recruitment packages are typically provided through contractual arrangements with annual, monthly or interim terms.
Our Products and Services
We help organizations find the best talent, and we help professionals find the best jobs and advance their careers. We do this through a number of products, including:

• | Resume databases. Each of our brands provides powerful, detailed searches of a large number of candidate resumes. Showing customers the right talent makes their recruiting efforts more efficient. 


• | Job postings. Because our job collections are focused on specific verticals, professionals searching for jobs can easily find jobs that are most relevant to them. In turn, the applications received by our customers are more likely to be relevant and qualified compared to applications received from generalist sites. Thus, showing professionals the right job postings benefits both the talent and the recruiting organization. 


• | Open Web. Our Open Web product searches approximately 200 social and professional sources to create an aggregated profile of a candidate’s professional experience, contributions, history and capabilities (as well as their passions and interests). This allows our customers to build broader pools of talent from across the web, gives them deeper insights into talent they discover, and allows them to engage prospective candidates with a differentiated message. 


• | Content and data. Each of our services provides tailored content to help professionals manage their careers and provide employers insight into recruiting strategies and trends. In addition, some of our brands offer data products specific to their industries.

Our Industry 
We primarily operate in the talent discovery and acquisition segment of the broader market for human capital management services through vertically-oriented career sites. There is a shortage of skilled professionals worldwide and we believe that the overall demand for talent acquisition and career development products and services has significant long-term growth potential. 
We also believe that certain industries that employ highly-skilled and highly-paid professionals will experience particularly strong demand for effective recruiting solutions due to the scarcity of such professionals. For example, as of December 2016, the seasonally unadjusted U.S. unemployment rate was 2.6% for computer-related occupations, 2.6% in the finance sector, and 2.9% in the healthcare sector, as compared to the overall national average of 4.7%, seasonally adjusted. Historically, the unemployment rate for college graduates has been lower than the unemployment rate for the U.S. overall. As of December 2016, the seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate for college graduates was 2.3%. 
We believe that there are five major trends that will continue to shape demand for talent acquisition services:

• | Greater competition for professional talent. The candidate-employer relationship has changed, with the balance of power shifting towards the candidates. The length of time to fill positions is an indicator of the availability of qualified talent in the labor market. Our proprietary indicator of time to fill an open position, the DHI-DFH Vacancy Duration Measure, indicates that the mean time to fill a position was 27.4 days in November 2016, nearly seven and a half days longer than November 2011 when the average was 20 days. In addition, our December 2016 Hiring Survey found that 55% of hiring managers cannot fill spots due to salary requirements.


• | Sourcing of talent will become more mainstream. Companies are increasingly engaging in ongoing sourcing to build robust candidate pools for both “just in time” candidates as well as future hiring needs. This means recruiters must proactively identify and build relationships with professionals ahead of the creation of a specific job opening. Our December 2016 Hiring Survey shows that three-quarters (75%) of companies say sourcing and building a bench of talent is more important today than a year ago. Complementing this trend is an increased interest in sourcing analytics, recruitment marketing, and employment branding.


• | Continued professional interest in career brands specific to industry and skills. Our services focus on domains or industries that require specialized skills and knowledge and, thus, customized content, profiles and search parameters. In addition, the professionals in our verticals often share a sense of personal identity and community that goes beyond the confines of their careers. We believe that both specialized skills and the sense of personal identity and community lead professionals in our verticals to prefer specialized career brands over generalist ones. 


• | Talent attraction and retention becoming more of a strategic priority for companies. According to the Aberdeen Group, in 2016, Best-in-Class organizations are 55% more likely than all others to proactively build and expand their candidate pipeline, regardless of current hiring needs. Similarly, the PWC 2016 US CEO Survey found that 31% of U.S. CEOs are ‘extremely concerned’ about the availability of key skills as a threat to their organizations’ growth prospects (an additional 45% are ‘somewhat concerned’). In this environment where top talent is hard to find, organizations are increasingly prioritizing retention of talent. According to Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends 2016, 92% of human resources respondents reported that they see a need to redesign the organization to drive engagement and retention, improve leadership, and build a meaningful culture. 


• | Increased use of data and analytics in human capital management and increased need for insights. As many companies prove the power of analytics in marketing and other business domains, organizations are seeking to gain a competitive advantage by applying data-driven insights to improve their hiring, retention and leadership capabilities. According to Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends 2016, 77% of surveyed companies believe that using people analytics is ‘very important or important.’ 

In this environment, we believe there is an opportunity for career management and talent acquisition tools that leverage the common interests, goals and skills of select professional communities. We believe that a focus on professional communities allows organizations to more efficiently identify talent, with more complete data and insights about that talent.
Our Value Proposition
We are a leading provider of data, insights and employment connections through specialized online professional communities organized around common professional interests and skill sets. This specialized approach provides professionals with more relevant career related information and opportunities, enhancing their ability to maximize their careers. Through engaging with professionals we are able to build rich and unique data sets around valuable talent pools. The combination of our focused online professional websites and rich data sets allows organizations to find and hire professional talent more efficiently and effectively, and therefore incentivizes them to source talent through our online professional communities. The benefits our services provide to both professionals and recruiting customers create a robust marketplace.

Benefits we provide to Professionals
Relevant employment connections. When professionals post their resumes or apply for jobs on our websites, they can make valuable connections with organizations who prize their skills and expertise. Professionals can avoid having to “sort through the clutter” on generalist career sites, and get the most out of their time by using our more focused services. 
Skills/industry-specific career management tools, information and insights. We provide professionals with targeted and relevant career development tools, content and news. For example, Dice and ClearanceJobs provide professionals with market and salary information and local market trends. In addition, the Dice Careers Mobile App allows professionals to evaluate their market value and map out which skills will increase their value. eFinancialCareers provides industry-specialized online career content, as well as career guides targeted to college and graduate students. The Rigzone services provide global energy industry news, detailed salary information, and data services related to the worldwide offshore rig fleet. We believe our career development services and tools provide professionals with the insights they need to propel their careers forward, and thus increase the engagement of professionals with our sites.
Benefits we provide to our Customers
Large pools of qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. We seek to improve the efficiency of the recruiting process for our customers by providing efficient access to large pools of highly qualified and hard-to-reach professionals. Because the communities of professionals who visit our websites are highly-skilled and specialized within specific industries, we believe our customers who post jobs receive applications from candidates who are better qualified for the positions, and that they receive fewer irrelevant applications than when using generalist sites. In addition, since our resume data and resume search functions are highly tailored by specialty, we believe that our customers can more efficiently identify talent using our resume databases than by using broader services.
Relevant information on prospective candidates. We believe that the specialized nature of our job posting and resume search products makes them inherently more relevant and efficient for recruiting. In addition, our Open Web product creates an aggregated profile of a professional’s experience, contributions, and capabilities as well as their passions and interests. Using all of these products together gives our customers the most complete view of a prospective candidate, and allows them to not only identify the best talent but also tailor their recruiting approach to each individual.
Hyper-targeted candidate outreach and employer branding. We offer recruiting customers the ability to target hard-to-find professionals with messages in the online forums they frequent. Our Lengo service leverages our Open Web capabilities to assemble candidate target lists based on specific factors like skill sets, work experience, location, or interests; then executes hyper-targeted employer branding or job search campaigns in online forums where specific potential candidates spend time. 
Candidate aggregation and pipeline management capabilities. Our getTalent solution is a SaaS based service that allows customers to aggregate candidate profiles and create talent pools and pipelines; nurture candidate leads and showcase employer brands through multiple engagement channels, including, email, events, SMS, and social networks; and analyze talent pipeline health, team performance, and engagement on multiple dimensions including candidate, campaign, talent pipeline and pool. In summary, getTalent allows customers to “hire with insight.”
Our Strategic Goals
Our company undertook a comprehensive strategic review during 2016 that resulted in the identification of our new tech-focused growth strategy designed to reinvigorate our core business and broaden our market opportunity. Our goal is to become the leading technology talent acquisition resource serving and engaging tech professionals across all industries. In addition, we plan to leverage our tech talent acquisition franchise to expand our next-generation talent acquisition solutions to the broader talent acquisition market, across industries and geographic markets. There are four components to our tech-focused strategy:
Focus investments in our tech-focused talent acquisition brands. We believe that focusing on technology talent acquisition provides us with the best opportunity to win in our increasingly competitive industry. Moreover, to capture the technology market opportunity we need to move quickly, so we plan to focus incremental investments behind the businesses that fall within our tech-focused portfolio - Dice, eFinancialCareers, ClearanceJobs, and Brightmatter Group.

• | Deepen the integration of Open Web with Dice through enhanced data analytic capabilities and new go-to-market strategies;


• | Improve performance attribution for tech-focused talent acquisition brands by accelerating integration with customers’ applicant tracking systems (ATS);


• | Launch a suite of new value-add Dice recruitment products, such as the HackerEarth partnership announced in January 2017; and

 9


• | Leverage eFinancialCareers finance franchise and global footprint to capitalize on the Fintech evolution in financial services and expand Dice internationally.

Increase engagement with professional talent. A key conclusion from our strategic review was that in today’s evolving digital media ecosystem it is critical for our success to have meaningful engagement with professionals in order to gain insights and information about professionals that are valuable to our recruiting customers. 

• | Offer technology professionals a comprehensive career management platform that provides skill specific insights that help align professionals goals and careers; and


• | Increase the adoption and utility of the Dice Careers App to increase engagement with technology professionals.

Develop next-generation talent acquisition solutions. As our industry continues to evolve, the talent acquisition ecosystem is becoming more complex and recruiters are pursuing more sophisticated search strategies. This environment creates demand for next-generation recruitment solutions, such as social sourcing, targeted employer branding, and candidate relationship management, among others, that are likely to gain share within the online and broader talent acquisition market in the coming years. We own a suite of next-generation solutions that are well positioned to benefit from this trend, which we believe will be a key source of growth for our company.

• | Increase commercialization of getTalent, our candidate relationship management service, through enhanced go-to-market initiatives;


• | Enhance the features of getTalent to further integrate the service into recruiter work flows, with innovations like our getTalent Mobile App that was launched in 2016; and


• | Further integrate our other next-generation services like Lengo and Open Web with our tech-focused talent acquisition brands and our getTalent service to offer customers more comprehensive solutions.

Acquire additional capabilities. The ongoing evolution and fragmentation our market provides us with the opportunity to launch or acquire new services to enhance our offering to professionals and recruiting customers.
Marketing and Sales
We focus our long-term marketing efforts on growing the number of professionals who visit and engage with our websites, which we believe increases the attractiveness of our websites to our customers. We use a combination of direct marketing, branding and communications initiatives to increase our brand awareness, traffic, new resumes posted and applications to job postings. We primarily engage in search engine marketing, online advertising, and participation in industry events, social media marketing and content marketing. Many of our brands use strategic alliances with relevant publishers, trade associations and industry groups to increase reach and traffic. Some of our brands have also invested in broader awareness campaigns that include outdoor advertising in select cities where competition for their respective specializations is high.
Our customer marketing efforts are primarily focused on lead generation activities, such as email campaigns and participation in industry events. We also use marketing communications, such as media relations, social media, and thought leadership content, to enhance brand awareness and client relationships. 
We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by brand, market segment, and geography. Our field sales groups target Fortune 1000 companies, large staffing and recruiting firms and other large and mid-size businesses. Our in-house sales teams focus on generating new business from recruiters and small- and mid-size companies, renewing customer contracts, increasing the service levels customers’ purchase and servicing the needs of our largest clients. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 150 sales personnel in the United States and approximately 100 in the rest of the world. In addition to our internal sales organization, we also use ad networks to help generate ad sales. 
 We also maintain teams of account managers and customer support specialists who work to ensure customers get the most from our products and services by providing training and assistance. In addition, our customer support departments perform some compliance functions, such as reviewing the websites for false or inaccurate job postings.
Customers
We currently serve a diversified customer base consisting of approximately 16,000 customers in total. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2016. Our customers include small, mid-sized and large direct employers, staffing companies, recruiting agencies, consulting firms and marketing departments of companies. As of December 31, 2016, notable customers of the Tech & Clearance segment included AT&T, Adecco, Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Dell, IBM, Kforce, 
 10

Manpower, Microsoft, NCI, Oracle, Robert Half, Samsung, and Yahoo. Notable customers of the Global Industry Group segment included Astra-Zeneca, Bloomberg, China Petroleum, Chevron, Four Seasons, Haliburton, Hilton, Hyatt, Inpex, Investors Service, JP Morgan Chase, Marriott, Merck, Michael Page International, Moody’s, Morgan Stanley, Oceaneering, Petronas, Regeneron, Robert Half, Saudi Aramco, Schlumberger, Shell, Standard Chartered Bank, UBS, and Wood Group. Notable customers of the Healthcare segment included Mayo Clinic, Providence Health & Services and UCLA Health. See Item 7 for a description of the segments.
Technology
We use a variety of technologies to support our websites. Each of our systems is designed so that it can be scaled by provisioning additional resources, adding additional hardware and increasing network capacity. Our systems are designed for redundancy at both the software and hardware levels. Whenever possible, we host our applications on clustered, high-availability hardware and cloud platforms. Our applications and data connections are monitored 24/7 for performance, responsiveness and stability.
Currently, our primary technology operations facilities are in co-location data centers in limited access, temperature-controlled environments with emergency power generation capability and service from multiple telecommunications providers, as well as with top-tier cloud providers. We have started moving our technology operations to a cloud-hosted infrastructure model and expect to complete this in 2017. This will provide greater business agility and flexibility, improved global delivery capabilities, and improved disaster recovery protection across all services.  
In the current operational model, we maintain backup systems for website operations within our geographically separate recovery data center. We replicate website data at various times throughout the day from the production co-location facility to the recovery data center. In the event of a loss of a data center, we have business resumption technology and offsite data storage capabilities in place. Additionally, we have robust firewalls and switchgear to provide network security, and have used substantial expert assistance in their configuration and testing.
Competition
The market for talent acquisition services is highly competitive with multiple online and offline competitors. With the evolution of the online recruiting model, there has been an increasing need to provide ease-of-use and relevance to professionals, as well as an efficient and cost-effective recruitment method for direct employers, recruiters and staffing companies. Additionally, further technological advancements have made it easier for new competitors to emerge with minimal barriers to entry, and advertisers have many alternatives available to reach their target audiences. Our ability to maintain our existing customer base and generate new customers depends to a significant degree on the quality of our candidate databases and audiences, the quality of our services, our ability to enhance our websites and the underlying technology of our websites to meet the needs of a rapidly-evolving marketplace, our pricing strategy and ability to introduce value-added products and services, and our reputation among our customers and potential customers, who are increasingly-sophisticated and demanding. Our competitors include: 

• | social and professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Google;


• | niche or specialist professional networking sites such as GitHub and Stack Overflow;


• | generalist job boards, some of which have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than we do, such as CareerBuilder, Monster, StepStone, and Seek which, unlike specialized job boards, permit customers to enter into a single contract to find professionals across multiple occupational categories and attempt to fill all of their hiring needs through a single website;


• | aggregators and distributors of job postings and profiles, including Indeed (owned by Recruit), TalentBin (owned by Monster Worldwide), Entelo, ZipRecruiter, Google and Craigslist;


• | career-focused community sites such as Glassdoor;


• | newspaper and magazine publishers, national and regional advertising agencies, executive search firms and search and selection firms that carry classified advertising, many of whom have developed, begun developing or acquired new media capabilities, such as recruitment websites, or have partnered with generalist job boards;


• | specialized services focused specifically on the industries we service, such as FT.com, Oilandgasjobsearch.com (owned by CareerBuilder), Doximity, Upwork and JobServe;


• | talent relationship management software providers such as Avature and SmashFly;


• | new and emerging competitors with new business models and products;


• | our customers, who seek to recruit candidates directly by using their own resources, including corporate websites; and


• | general business sites and print publications, as well as technology news and information community sites, such as Google News, Digg.com and Reddit.com.

To protect confidential information and to comply with our obligations to our users, we impose constraints on our customers to whom we provide user data, which are consistent with our commitments to our users. Additionally, when we provide lists to third parties, including to our advertiser customers, it is under contractual terms that are consistent with our obligations to our users and with applicable laws and regulations.
U.S. and Foreign Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of government regulations, both domestic and foreign, that regulate our products and online service offerings, including content, copyright infringement, user privacy, advertising and promotional activities, taxation, access charges, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations have enacted and also are considering, and may consider in the future, other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet. Areas of potential regulation include, but are not limited to, libel, electronic contracting, pricing, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership.
There are a number of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online. Certain laws regulate commercial electronic messages. Such laws frequently provide a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establish penalties for the sending of email messages that are not compliant with such laws, including messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content or that do not provide an electronic method of informing the sender of the recipient’s decision not to receive further commercial emails.
We are subject to domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies and terms of use agreements describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or terms of use agreements, or privacy-related laws and regulations, could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. The interpretation of these privacy and data protection laws and various regulators’ approach to their enforcement, as well as our products and services, continue to evolve over time. We face the risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways in different jurisdictions or in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new and unclear laws will be enacted. Complying with these varying domestic and foreign requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our products and services and, ultimately, in a loss of customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
The application of laws and regulations affecting online business to our products and services is often unclear, and these laws and how various jurisdictions interpret these laws continue to evolve. Compliance with these laws may be expensive and could harm our business. Any failure by the Company to comply with these laws and regulations could result in actions against us by governmental authorities or other entities, which could harm our business, including governmental or court orders that we cease certain activities.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Our business is subject to U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.”
