Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases. Our goal is to transform the treatment paradigm for patients suffering from these potentially life-threatening conditions for which there are no approved medicines or where existing approved medicines have limitations. Our lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mimetic that we are currently evaluating in multiple acute organ injuries and related indications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and injuries to other major organs, such as the lungs, central nervous system (CNS) and heart. Within AKI, we are currently evaluating ANG-3777's ability to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated AKI, also known as delayed graft function (DGF), in patients at risk for kidney dysfunction, as well as for the treatment of AKI associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CSA-AKI). We are also evaluating ANG-3777 for indications within acute lung injury (ALI), with our primary focus on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as acute CNS injuries. We are advancing multiple programs for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, leading with ANG-3070, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), and our inhibitor of rho kinase 2 (ROCK2). We also continue to develop other preclinical product candidates, including our CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) inhibitors, which we are investigating for the purpose of targeting aldosterone-related fibrotic diseases.
Our pipeline of product candidates has been developed internally and is the result of over 20 years of in-house research by a team that has made seminal contributions to the understanding of HGF and fibrotic pathways. Our pipeline of product candidates, programs and anticipated milestones are reflected in the chart below:
In November 2020, we entered into a license agreement (the Vifor License) with Vifor International, Ltd. (Vifor Pharma), granting Vifor Pharma global rights (excluding Greater China) to develop, manufacture and commercialize ANG-3777 in all therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic uses for renal indications, including forms of AKI, and congestive heart failure (collectively, the Renal Indications). Pursuant to the Vifor License, we are entitled to receive $80 million in upfront and near-term clinical milestone payments, including $30 million in upfront cash that we received in November 2020, and a $30 million equity investment, $5 million of which we received in January 2021 and $25 million of which we received upon the consummation of a concurrent private placement contingent contemporaneously with the closing of our Initial Public offering (IPO). We are also eligible to receive post-approval milestones of up to approximately $260 million and sales-related milestones of up to $1.585 billion, providing a total potential deal value of up to $1.925 billion (subject to certain specified reductions and offsets), plus tiered royalties on net sales of ANG-3777 at royalty rates of up to 40%. The first United States market-related sales milestone we are eligible for is a $100 million milestone payable upon $300 million in net United States annual sales. Under the

Vifor License, we are responsible for executing a pre-specified clinical development plan designed to obtain regulatory approvals of ANG-3777 for DGF and CSA-AKI.
ANG-3777, an HGF Mimetic
Our lead product candidate, ANG-3777, has the potential to be a first-in-class small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of HGF. HGF activates the c-Met receptor, which triggers a cascade of pathways with a central role in tissue repair and organ recovery that has been well established. We believe that when an acute organ injury occurs, effective organ self-repair is hindered by a naturally-occurring mismatch in timing of peak levels of HGF concentration relative to c-Met expression, an issue that could be addressed by augmenting the activity of HGF with our HGF mimetic during the time of maximal c-Met expression. ANG-3777 has demonstrated several similarities to HGF, including c-Met dependence and selective c-Met receptor activation, without acting on other growth factor receptors. In addition, it has a substantially longer half-life than native or recombinant HGF. As a result, we believe ANG-3777 has several advantages that could enable it to address multiple forms of organ injury and related indications, including those with significant patient populations and for which no approved therapies currently exist.
The potential advantages of ANG-3777 include:
▪Enhanced key natural repair pathway—ANG-3777 is an HGF mimetic that selectively activates the HGF/c-Met pathway, an early and essential pathway in acute organ injury repair. By initiating the HGF/c-Met cascade, ANG-3777 triggers downstream activation of multiple processes that we believe both attenuate further organ injury and promote organ repair.
▪Expanded treatment window—Our studies have shown that treatment with ANG-3777 can be successfully administered up to 48 hours after injury, increasing the viable window for intervention and significantly expanding the addressable patient population.
▪Favorable adverse event profile—In our Phase 2 clinical trial for DGF, the overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar between the treatment and placebo arms, no serious adverse event was attributed to ANG-3777 by investigators and no patient on treatment withdrew because of a serious adverse event.
▪Ease of administration—ANG-3777 has demonstrated a half-life of approximately three hours compared to a half-life of less than five minutes for native or recombinant HGF. Due to its longer half-life, ANG-3777 can be administered once daily intravenously (IV).
▪Reduced pharmacoeconomic burden—Acute organ injury results in substantial costs to the healthcare system. A therapy that effectively attenuates organ injury could significantly reduce this economic burden by decreasing short-term costs, including increased hospital days and re-admissions, as well as long-term costs, including costs associated with outpatient dialysis and other outpatient services.
ANG-3777 for DGF. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of DGF following deceased-donor kidney transplantation in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction. DGF is a severe form of AKI resulting from ischemia-reperfusion injury (caused by oxygen deprivation and reintroduction) following kidney transplantation and defined as the need for dialysis within seven days following transplantation. In the United States and Europe, over 30,000 of the kidney transplant procedures performed annually use deceased-donor kidneys, and nearly one-third of these transplant recipients, or more than 10,000 patients per year, are diagnosed with DGF. DGF has a very high clinical and economic burden, and there are no approved therapies. In our Phase 2 clinical trial for DGF, ANG-3777 achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in its primary endpoint measuring production of 1,200 cubic centimeters (cc) of urine as compared to placebo, though such results were not statistically significant (p=0.09). In addition, ANG-3777 demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements as compared to placebo on a key secondary endpoint, mean serum creatinine, and in a post hoc analysis showed statistically significant (p=0.039) increases as compared to placebo in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months, which is the planned primary endpoint in our Phase 3 registration trial. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment and placebo arms of the Phase 2 clinical trial, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events or treatment-related discontinuations. We expect to report topline data from our Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 by the end of 2021. If the trial is successful, and subject to discussions with the FDA, we expect to file an NDA with the FDA for DGF in 2022. Pursuant to the Vifor License, Vifor Pharma holds global exclusive rights to commercialize ANG-3777 for this indication, except in Greater China, where we have licensed development and commercialization rights exclusively to Sinovant Sciences HK Limited (Sinovant and the Sinovant License).

ANG-3777 for CSA-AKI. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate ANG-3777 in patients at risk for developing CSA-AKI. This indication is a frequent complication of cardiac surgery, with approximately 150,000 cases per year in the United States and Europe, or nearly one-third of the approximately 450,000 coronary bypass and valve replacement surgeries performed annually in the United States and Europe. There are no approved therapies to address CSA-AKI, which is associated with both high mortality and significant economic burden. The planned primary endpoint for our Phase 2 clinical trial is the increase in serum creatinine above baseline and an additional important endpoint is the occurrence of Major Adverse Kidney Events at 90 days (MAKE 90), which has previously been accepted by the FDA as an approvable endpoint in this indication. We expect to report topline data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2021. If our Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrates sufficient evidence of efficacy, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 registration trial in CSA-AKI in the first quarter of 2022, subject to discussions with the FDA. Pursuant to the Vifor License, Vifor Pharma holds global exclusive rights to commercialize ANG-3777 for this indication, except in Greater China, where we have licensed development and commercialization rights exclusively to Sinovant.
ANG-3777 for ALI. We are also investigating the use of ANG-3777 for indications within ALI, with our primary focus on ARDS, a severe form of ALI that is characterized by the sudden onset of pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and impaired oxygenation. In order to evaluate ANG-3777's potential to treat this form of ALI, we initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in Brazil to investigate ANG-3777 for the reduction of severity and progression of ALI in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia who are at high risk of progressing to ARDS. COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. In severe cases, COVID-19 is often complicated by pneumonia, ARDS and multi-organ failure, including AKI, neurological injuries and cardiac injuries. As a result, we believe this study, if successful, could demonstrate the benefits of ANG-3777 for the treatment of ARDS. Studies have shown that the incidence of ARDS is between 150,000 and 200,000 cases per year in the United States, resulting in between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year. We completed enrollment in this trial in March 2021, expect to report topline data from this Phase 2 trial in the first half of 2021 and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in an ARDS indication in 2022. We hold global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize ANG-3777 for this indication, subject to certain limitations under the Vifor License and except in Greater China, where we have licensed development and commercialization rights exclusively to Sinovant.
ANG-3777 for CNS. The role of the HGF/c-Met pathway has been extensively studied in CNS injuries such as acute spinal cord injury and cerebral ischemia, or stroke. A similar HGF/c-Met timing mismatch to the one observed in acute kidney injury is also present in CNS injuries, and both we and independent researchers have demonstrated via in vivo studies that administration of ANG-3777 or exogenous HGF can reduce the severity of and enhance the recovery from acute injuries to the brain and spinal cord. Based on these preclinical findings, we believe ANG-3777 could be beneficial in treating patients with acute spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and stroke. We are planning to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application for an acute CNS indication in 2021 and initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777 in 2022. We hold global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize ANG-3777 for this indication, subject to certain limitations under the Vifor License and except in Greater China, where we have licensed development and commercialization rights exclusively to Sinovant. 
Our Programs for the Treatment of Fibrotic Diseases
ANG-3070 for Fibrotic Diseases. Our second product candidate, ANG-3070, is a highly selective, orally-bioavailable small molecule TKI we are developing as a potential treatment for fibrotic diseases. ANG-3070 is the result of our extensive in-house research of key fibrotic pathways impacted by tyrosine kinases, the intersecting nodes between these pathways and the correlation of genomic and proteomic signatures for different types of fibrosis. This approach enabled us to design ANG-3070 with potentially improved specificity and receptor-binding affinity, relative to currently approved TKIs, in order to deliver promising activity in fibrotic pathways while limiting off-target inhibition. ANG-3070 has demonstrated target engagement as an anti-fibrotic agent in a variety of animal models and has shown in vitro the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory tyrosine kinases at exposures achievable by oral administration. We are also currently evaluating ANG-3070 in a Phase 1 healthy-volunteer trial in Australia, and we expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2021. We believe the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from our Phase 1 trial support the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial. Subject to the final results from this trial and discussions with the FDA, we plan to advance ANG-3070 into Phase 2 clinical development in 2021, and we are considering indications, such as primary proteinuric renal diseases and potentially non-proteinuric renal diseases at high risk of progression. We hold global rights to ANG-3070.

ROCK2 Inhibitor for Fibrotic Diseases. Our third product candidate is a potent selective ROCK2 inhibitor that has demonstrated much higher affinity for ROCK2 versus ROCK1. Rho kinase (ROCK) signal transduction pathways are implicated in the development of fibrosis. Inhibition of the ROCK isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, has shown promise in fibrosis; however, ROCK1 inhibition has been associated with inducing hypotension (low blood pressure). Recent scientific work using specific genetic or pharmacological reduction of ROCK2 indicates ROCK2 inhibition by itself can result in anti-fibrotic activity without causing hypotension. These findings informed our strategy to develop a ROCK2-specific inhibitor, with the goal of minimizing ROCK1 inhibition, as a potential treatment for fibrosis and other diseases. We believe this approach could translate into a product candidate with enhanced tolerability that may support long-term systemic use in chronic diseases. We expect the first indication for our ROCK2 inhibitor to be a chronic fibrotic indication such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We expect to select a lead compound from our ROCK2 inhibitor program and initiate IND-enabling studies in 2021. We hold global rights to our ROCK2 inhibitor program.
CYP11B2 Inhibitors. We are developing proprietary CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) inhibitors, which we are investigating for the purpose of targeting aldosterone-related diseases, including resistant hypertension, congestive heart failure and kidney fibrosis. We expect to select a lead compound from our CYP11B2 inhibitor program and initiate IND-enabling studies for the program in 2021. We hold global rights to our CYP11B2 inhibitor program.
Commercialization
If ANG-3777 is approved for DGF and/or CSA-AKI, we expect that it will be commercialized by Vifor Pharma pursuant to the Vifor License in the United States, Europe and other markets (excluding Greater China). Within Greater China, Sinovant is responsible for the development and, if approved, commercialization of ANG-3777 for all indications. There are approximately 250 institutions performing 23,000 kidney transplants in the United States annually, with the top 150 institutions accounting for over 85% of all kidney transplants each year. Vifor Pharma has an extensive commercial infrastructure addressing the renal market within and outside the United States, including distribution, contracting, medical affairs and sales functions. As a result, we believe Vifor Pharma is well positioned to successfully address these market opportunities by leveraging its strong existing relationships within the nephrology community. The Vifor License has a total potential deal value of up to $1.925 billion (subject to certain specified reductions and offsets), plus tiered royalties on net sales of ANG-3777 at royalty rates of up to 40%.
Management
Our pipeline and company strategy were originated and are supported by a management team with extensive experience and expertise in clinical research and development, business development and commercialization. Our founder and current Executive Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer, Itzhak Goldberg, M.D., F.A.C.R., has made seminal contributions to the understanding of HGF and fibrotic pathways. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jay Venkatesan, M.D., was the founder and CEO of Alpine BioSciences (acquired by Cascadian Therapeutics, which was subsequently acquired by Seagen), was a key investor in Mavupharma Inc. (acquired by AbbVie) and is a former portfolio manager of Ayer Capital and director of Brookside Capital Partners (the hedge fund group affiliated with Bain Capital). Our Chief Medical Officer, John F. Neylan, M.D., has held leadership roles at Keryx Biopharmaceuticals and Genzyme Corporation. These individuals and other members of our senior management team have contributed to the clinical development, registration and/or commercialization of over fifty approved drug products.

2020, we received approximately $68.8 million from U.S. government grants and contracts and have raised aggregate net proceeds of $114.1 million through the issuance and sale of our debt and equity securities.
Our corporate operations are based in San Francisco, California, our clinical development and regulatory teams are primarily located in Boston, Massachusetts, and our discovery and research programs are based in Uniondale, New York.
Our Strategy
We are focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases. Our goal is to transform the treatment paradigm for patients suffering from these potentially life-threatening conditions for which there are no approved medicines or where existing approved medicines have limitations. The key tenets of our business strategy are to:
▪Complete pivotal development and obtain regulatory approval of ANG-3777 for DGF. We believe ANG-3777 has the potential to become the first approved therapy for DGF. We have recently completed enrollment in a Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of DGF following kidney transplantation in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction, and we expect to report topline data from this trial by the end of 2021. Prior to our current trial, we completed a Phase 2 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANG-3777 for improving kidney function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation who showed signs of kidney injury and were considered to be at high risk of DGF. As part of this trial, we demonstrated improved short- and long-term graft function, with no evidence of increased adverse events attributable to ANG-3777 as compared with patients in the placebo arm. If our Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 for DGF is successful, we expect to file an NDA with the FDA for DGF in 2022, subject to discussions with the FDA. ANG-3777 has received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for DGF.
▪Advance ANG-3777 through clinical proof of concept for the treatment of CSA-AKI and ALI, and advance additional indications through development. Given the HGF/c-Met pathway's role in organ repair in several types of acute organ injuries, we intend to investigate ANG-3777 for several related indications. In particular, based on its novel mechanism of action, we believe ANG-3777 has the potential to be used, if approved, as a therapy for up to approximately one-third of patients in the United States undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass. As a result, we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ANG-3777 for CSA-AKI. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2021. In addition, we are evaluating ANG-3777's potential to treat ARDS in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in Brazil of ANG-3777 for the reduction of severity and progression of ALI in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who are at high risk of progressing to ARDS. We completed enrollment in this trial in March 2021 and expect to report topline data from this Phase 2 trial in the first half of 2021. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate other possible development options in other common causes of ARDS, including other forms of viral infection, sepsis, smoke-inhalation or chemical insult trauma. We also intend to evaluate the use of ANG-3777 in other forms of acute organ injury, including the CNS and heart. By leveraging our growing safety and efficacy datasets, we believe we may be able to rapidly advance ANG-3777 into clinical proof-of-concept trials for these follow-on indications, which could enable us to address significantly larger patient populations and maximize the commercial potential of ANG-3777 more quickly.
▪Advance development of ANG-3070 for the treatment of fibrosis. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis enabled us to develop molecules precisely targeting key fibrotic pathways, with the goal of delivering treatment to patients with disease driven by these pathways. Our first clinical-stage fibrosis product candidate, ANG-3070, is precisely engineered to selectively inhibit what we believe are key pathways associated with fibrotic diseases while limiting off-target activity. We believe preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from our Phase 1 healthy-volunteer trial of ANG-3070 in Australia support the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial. Subject to final results from this trial and discussions with the FDA, we plan to advance ANG-3070 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2021 in the United States, and we are considering indications such as primary proteinuric renal diseases and potentially non-proteinuric renal diseases at high risk of progression.

▪Advance development of our earlier-stage programs addressing fibrotic diseases. Our ROCK2 inhibitor is designed to be a potent and highly selective inhibitor of ROCK2, with minimal inhibition of ROCK1, which we believe could translate into a therapeutic with enhanced tolerability that may support chronic use. We expect to select a lead compound from our ROCK2 inhibitor program and initiate IND-enabling studies in 2021. We are also developing proprietary CYP11B2 inhibitors for the purpose of targeting aldosterone-related fibrotic diseases. We expect to select a lead compound from our CYP11B2 program and initiate IND-enabling studies for the program in 2021.
▪Independently commercialize any approved products in indications and geographies where we believe we can maximize value and pursue other options to realize the full potential of our pipeline. We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those product candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We plan to collaborate on product candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas or patient populations that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. Our license agreement with Vifor Pharma for the commercialization of ANG-3777 for Renal Indications is a product of our strategy.
Our Pipeline
Our research and development activities are primarily focused on discovering and investigating small molecules to prevent, treat or mitigate life-threatening acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases. We have internally developed a pipeline of product candidates designed to either amplify existing protective, reparative and regenerative systems or to suppress pathways responsible for initiating and promoting fibrotic disease. Due to the link between organ injury and progressive organ fibrosis, our research efforts have spanned the continuum from acute organ injury, such as AKI and ALI, to approaches intended to slow or halt the progression of organ fibrosis.
Our pipeline of product candidates, programs and anticipated milestones are reflected in the chart below:
ANG-3777, Our Lead Product Candidate
Our lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is potentially a first-in-class hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mimetic. We engineered ANG-3777 to mimic the biological activity of HGF in activating critical pathways in the body's natural organ repair process following an acute organ injury. As a result, we believe ANG-3777 has the potential to be used in multiple acute organ injury indications, including AKI as well as injuries to other major organs, including the lungs, CNS and heart. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated acute kidney injury, also known as DGF, following kidney transplantation in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction. We previously completed a Phase 2

clinical trial in which ANG-3777 demonstrated improved short- and long-term graft function as compared with placebo. We are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777 for acute kidney injury associated with CSA-AKI and have completed enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of patients with ALI resulting from COVID-19 associated pneumonia at high risk of progressing to ARDS. We expect to report topline data from our Phase 3 DGF registration trial by the end of 2021, our Phase 2 clinical trial for CSA-AKI in the second half of 2021 and our Phase 2 ALI trial in the first half of 2021. If our Phase 3 registration trial for DGF is successful, and subject to discussions with the FDA, we expect to file an NDA with the FDA for DGF in 2022. If our proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in CSA-AKI demonstrates sufficient evidence of efficacy of ANG-3777, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 registration trial in this indication in the first quarter of 2022, subject to discussions with the FDA. If we achieve proof of concept in our Phase 2 clinical trial for ALI in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who are at high risk of progressing to ARDS, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in an ARDS indication in 2022. ANG-3777 has received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for DGF.
The Role of the HGF/c-Met Pathway in Acute Organ Injury
Acute organ injury involves the rapid deterioration of organ function and viability. It is caused by several factors including: ischemia, or oxygen deprivation of the organ; reperfusion injury caused by the formation of free radicals when oxygen flow returns to an oxygen-starved organ; large changes in blood pressure, such as those occurring during cardiac arrest or resulting from vascular instability in sepsis; hemodynamic shear stress; toxic injuries, such as those caused by venoms, toxins and drugs; and traumatic injuries, such as blunt trauma or burns. Ischemia-reperfusion injury commonly occurs in connection with organ transplantation as well as cardiac surgery. Regardless of the cause, all of these injuries trigger the immediate activation of repair pathways, which help to restore function and facilitate recovery of the injured organ. We believe the most important repair pathway triggered in response to an acute organ injury is the HGF/c-Met pathway.
When an organ is injured, the body releases stored HGF into the blood. HGF then travels to the site of the injury and binds to the promoter region of the c-Met receptor gene on cells in that location to upregulate its expression, which expression is mediated in part by AP-1, a transcriptional factor responsive to cytokines, bacterial and viral infections, and other cell stress signals. HGF also binds to c-Met receptors expressed on the surface of cells in the injured organ, causing dimerization of the c-Met receptors and activation of downstream pathways. HGF is the only ligand known to bind to c-Met and cause its activation. The binding of HGF to c-Met triggers a series of downstream signaling pathways responsible for preventing apoptosis (cell death), stimulating cell proliferation, promoting angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), improving cellular motility, and remodeling the extracellular matrix, all in order to restore normal structure and function to the injured organ.
In the illustrative diagram below, some of the essential proteins in transducing and amplifying the c-Met signal are shown, along with a representative set of actions that these proteins are responsible for inducing. For instance, the adaptor proteins Grb2, SHC and Gab1, among others, are responsible for recruiting downstream signaling proteins including the following (and some of their respective actions):
▪Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK/MAPK: increase in mRNA translation, promote angiogenesis, stimulate cell proliferation, prevent apoptosis and promote tubulogenesis (restoring normal tissue architecture);
▪PI3K: increase cell motility, promote tubulogenesis, prevent apoptosis and induce cellular differentiation;
▪AKT/mTOR: prevent apoptosis, increase metabolism, increase cell motility, promote angiogenesis and transcription regulation;
▪Stat-3: stimulate cell proliferation, prevent apoptosis and induce cellular differentiation; and
▪FAK: alter cellular adhesion, increase cell motility and promote angiogenesis.
HGF/c-Met also downregulates the pro-fibrotic cytokine, TGF-b (transforming growth factor beta) to prevent the organ from entering the progressive cycle of fibrosis (growth inhibition, extracellular matrix deposition and cell death). These interactions are influenced by the cellular environment in which these pathways are activated. For example, in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury, c-Met transcription is upregulated by HGF as well as by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which itself is activated during tissue ischemia. Through these mechanisms, HGF/c-Met signaling is amplified, thereby initiating the cascade of organ repair.

The Importance of the HGF/c-Met Pathway in Acute Organ Injury
As shown in the following figure, HGF is released into circulation and reaches peak concentration levels approximately two hours after acute organ injury (the solid blue line). However, the c-Met receptor is synthesized more slowly (dashed orange line) and peaks approximately 24 hours following the injury, resulting in insufficient levels of HGF available relative to the peak expression levels of c-Met on the cell surface.

 The Mismatch of HGF and c-Met Following Acute Kidney Injury
Clinical studies of therapeutic interventions for acute organ injuries have shown that preventing, treating or reversing acute organ injury is very challenging. Most approaches have focused primarily on blocking various pro-inflammatory or pro-fibrotic pathways. These trials have generally failed to yield approved therapies, which we believe is due to the narrow therapeutic window necessitated by the need to inhibit these pathways prior to propagation of the inflammatory signal cascade, the multiple pathways involved in acute organ injury and the difficulty in defining when acute organ injury is beginning.
HGF has shown modest early effects on injury pathways, but the dominant effects of c-Met agonism by HGF are primarily seen in the recovery and repair pathways, which are not meaningfully activated until at least six hours after acute organ injury and are maximally activated over a few days following acute organ injury. The short half-life of native or recombinant HGF protein (less than five minutes) limits the use of exogenous HGF to address the mismatch between HGF release and c-Met expression during this window. As a result, we believe a molecule that mimics the effects of HGF, but with a substantially longer half-life, has the potential to provide a more robust recovery from acute organ injury in both the short- and long-term.
Our Solution: ANG-3777, an HGF Mimetic
Our lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is a small molecule designed to mimic the biological activity of HGF, thereby activating the c-Met cascade of pathways involved in tissue repair and organ recovery. ANG-3777 has demonstrated several similarities to HGF, including c-Met dependence and selective c-Met receptor activation, without acting on other growth factor receptors. In addition, it has a substantially longer half-life than HGF. As a

result, we believe ANG-3777 has the potential to be a first-in-class therapeutic with a unique approach to addressing acute organ injury. The following are the potential advantages and key properties of ANG-3777:
▪Enhanced key natural repair pathway—ANG-3777 is an HGF mimetic that selectively activates the HGF/c-Met pathway, an early and essential pathway in acute organ injury repair in multiple organs that results from multiple causes of injury (including mechanical, thermal, chemical and ischemic causes). Therefore, we believe that ANG-3777 may have additional treatment potential in multifactorial or complex organ injuries beyond our initial indications. By initiating the HGF/c-Met cascade, ANG-3777 triggers downstream activation of multiple processes that we believe both attenuate further organ injury and promote organ repair.
▪Expanded treatment window—Our studies have shown that treatment with ANG-3777 can be successfully administered up to 48 hours from the time of injury, increasing the viable window for intervention. In many instances of acute organ injuries, including those resulting from thrombosis (stroke or acute MI), trauma, and transplantation, the injury occurs many hours before treatment can be administered. Therefore, a therapy that does not require prophylactic or administration concurrent with the injury could significantly expand the addressable patient population.
▪Favorable adverse event profile—In our Phase 2 clinical trial for DGF, the overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar between the treatment and placebo arms, no serious adverse event was attributed to ANG-3777 by investigators and no patient on treatment withdrew because of a serious adverse event.
▪Ease of administration—ANG-3777 has demonstrated a half-life of approximately three hours compared to a half-life of less than five minutes for native or recombinant HGF. Due to its longer half-life, ANG-3777 can be administered once daily intravenously.
▪Reduced pharmacoeconomic burden—Acute organ injury results in substantial costs to the healthcare system. A therapy that effectively attenuates organ injury could significantly reduce this economic burden by decreasing short-term costs, including increased hospital days and re-admissions, as well as long-term costs, including costs associated with outpatient dialysis and other outpatient services.
The HGF/c-Met pathway is responsible for organ repair in several types of acute organ injuries and, in preclinical in vivo models, ANG-3777 has demonstrated its potential to play a role in the repair process in numerous examples of acute organ injury, including kidney, lung, CNS and heart-related injuries. In the United States, there are approximately eight million patients diagnosed with acute organ injury annually. AKI is the most prevalent acute organ injury, with the number of hospitalized cases in the United States estimated to be four million annually. Other common acute organ injuries include injuries to the heart and the lung, of which there are approximately two million and 280,000 cases in the United States on an annual basis, respectively.
Our initial focus for the development of ANG-3777 is on two forms of AKI, in ALI, and in certain acute CNS injuries. Assuming successful outcomes in our clinical trials in our initial indications, we believe this could substantially enhance the addressable market.
Acute Kidney Injury
Acute kidney injury is a major health issue and is defined as an abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function based on an elevation in serum creatinine level, a reduction in urine output, the need for renal replacement therapy or a combination of these factors. AKI is caused by a variety of factors, including ischemia (lack of oxygen), reperfusion (reintroduction of oxygen), drug and toxin exposures, sepsis, major trauma and/or hemorrhage, among others. There are no approved treatments for AKI, and the management of AKI involves supportive efforts including fluid management, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure and correction of electrolyte imbalances. It has been estimated that hospital-based AKI results in greater than $5.4 billion in annual excess costs to hospitals in the United States.
AKI is a common complication in cardiac surgery and major non-cardiac surgery and is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Moreover, postoperative AKI is associated with long-term negative outcomes including chronic kidney disease and late mortality.
Within AKI, we have chosen to initially investigate ANG-3777's potential to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated acute kidney injury, also known as delayed graft function, following kidney

transplantation in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction, as well as its potential to treat acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass.
Statistical Significance
In the description of our product candidate programs, clinical trials and preclinical studies below, 'n' represents the number of subjects in a particular group and 'p' or 'p-values' represent the probability that the therapeutic intervention is not better than the comparator arm but achieved a difference due to chance. A p-value £ 0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance in registration trials and is generally considered supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities.
ANG-3777 for the Reduction in Severity of Delayed Graft Function
Overview: Kidney Transplantation and Delayed Graft Function
Delayed graft function (DGF) is a severe form of AKI resulting from ischemia-reperfusion injury following kidney transplantation. It is distinct from transplant rejection, which is an immunologic condition, and is most commonly seen in recipients of deceased donor kidneys, in part due to the longer periods of warm ischemia (ischemia occurring at body temperature) and cold ischemia (ischemia occurring during kidney preservation and transport) typical for deceased-donor kidney transplants. DGF is most commonly defined as the need for dialysis (the extracorporeal removal of waste products from the blood when the kidneys are in a state of failure) within seven days following transplantation.
One of the challenges with DGF stems from the timing of the injury to the kidney, which can occur before the transplantation surgery. For example, in donors who die suddenly (cardiac death) or who have brain death, the kidney injury occurs when blood flow to the kidney is reduced or stopped, which occurs at or before the time of organ recovery. From that point, the lack of oxygen and nutrients continues to damage the donor kidney until the point at which it is successfully implanted into a recipient, which often takes place between 12 and 24 hours later. After the kidney is transplanted, it undergoes further damage as a result of reperfusion injury caused by the formation of free radicals as oxygen flow returns to the oxygen-starved organ. This combination of damage and its timing makes it difficult for interventions that only block damage pathways, for instance by targeting inflammatory pathways, to work effectively to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of DGF.
Following transplantation of the kidney, physicians monitor a series of key metrics related to DGF, including urine output and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), to assess how the transplanted kidney is performing. Adverse readings in these key metrics are indicative of kidney damage and more severe forms of DGF, and are predictive of longer-term negative outcomes, such as reduced survival of the transplanted kidney and increased patient morbidity and mortality.
For example, the left graph in the following figure shows the lowest two quintiles of patients (solid blue lines) with the worst urine output within 24 hours after transplantation have a significantly decreased chance of their new kidney surviving for five years compared to the highest quintile (dashed orange line). The right graph in the following figure shows patients with the highest eGFR at discharge (dotted green line) have better cumulative kidney transplant survival than patients with lower eGFR at discharge (dashed orange and solid blue lines).
Key Metrics Related to Delayed Graft Function Severity

Table of Contents

Regardless of the specific measurement used, the occurrence of more severe DGF is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in median graft survival time, from approximately ten years for patients with less severe DGF to approximately five years for patients who experienced more severe DGF.
It is well-established that eGFR, calculated based in part on serum creatinine levels, is a predictor of long-term kidney graft survival. Upon discharge from the hospital after kidney transplantation, eGFR is the third strongest predictor of kidney graft failure, surpassed only by the presence or absence of dialysis in the first week post-transplantation and by recipient age. However, by three, six and twelve months after discharge, eGFR becomes the strongest predictor of kidney graft survival. With the support of two leading academic collaborators, we analyzed data from more than 150,000 patients in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database and demonstrated eGFR at six and twelve months after discharge is a much stronger predictor of graft survival than traditional predictors, such as presence or absence of dialysis, recipient age and race, donor diabetes and hypertension, and transplant factors, such as cold ischemia time and immunologic mismatch between donor and recipient. In addition, scientific literature also supports that a 5 mL/min/1.73m difference in twelve-month eGFR is clinically meaningful.
In addition, the National Kidney Foundation's predictive chronic kidney disease (CKD) staging system utilizes eGFR to categorize patients with CKD into five stages. Patients with higher eGFR are placed in lower stages, with such classifications being associated with significantly longer life expectancies, and patients at higher stages have significant long-term mortality. For example, a 50-year-old male moving from CKD Stage 3B disease (eGFR equal to between 30 and 44 mL/min) down to CKD Stage 3A disease (eGFR equal to between 45 and 59 mL/min) would be expected to see an increase in life expectancy of 7.7 years. A 50-year-old female experiencing a similar improvement in eGFR would be expected to see an increase in life expectancy of 9.1 years.
For these reasons, we believe eGFR is a meaningful marker of the extent of recovery from the kidney dysfunction resulting from transplantation. Following discussions with the FDA and our submission of an amendment to the clinical trial protocol, we are using difference in patient eGFR between the treatment and placebo arms measured during a 12-month period following transplant as our primary endpoint in our Phase 3 registration trial.
Delayed Graft Function: Market
The number of kidney transplants and incidence of DGF have both been increasing steadily over the last five years. The increasing incidence of diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome are projected to increase the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Regardless of the causative factors, the major outcome of CKD is progression toward ESRD. According to the United States Renal Data System, in 2017 more than 747,000 patients in the United States had kidney failure and of these, more than 520,000 individuals were placed on dialysis. Dialysis, while effective at prolonging life, can cost approximately $90,000 or more per patient per year in the United States and results in both poor long-term clinical outcomes and a substantially diminished quality of life. Kidney transplantation is the most clinically effective and cost-efficient of the options for renal replacement therapy (the other option being dialysis) and is the most common organ transplant operation performed in the United States.
Unfortunately, the number of kidneys available for transplantation has not increased to meet the growing need. According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 100,000 patients await kidney transplants in the United States. UNOS reports that approximately 23,000 kidney transplants were completed in the United States in 2019, of which approximately 70% involved kidneys from deceased donors. The compound annual growth rate of the proportion of kidney transplants coming from deceased donors has exceeded 7% per year over the last five years. Approximately 90% of the incidence of DGF occurs in patients who receive transplants from deceased donors. In Europe, there are at least 15,000 deceased donor kidney transplants per year.
The incidence of DGF varies across transplant centers in the United States and Europe, occurring in nearly one-third of patients receiving kidney transplants from deceased donors, or more than 10,000 patients per year in the United States and Europe. DGF can lead to significantly longer hospital stays, higher admission costs, greater need for dialysis in the post-transplant period and a greater percentage of patient admissions to the ICU. Increased hospitalization, re-admissions and other care amounts to an increase in costs of approximately $20,000 per patient for the transplant center in the United States. Dialysis, for which Medicare spending per ESRD patient per year was approximately $90,000 in 2017, is also a contributing factor to the economic burden of DGF. Some patients do not require dialysis in the first week after transplantation but still have significant kidney dysfunction post-transplantation. This condition is referred to as Slow Graft Function (SGF) or functional Delayed Graft Function (fDGF), and these patients have long-term outcomes that approximate the outcomes in DGF. Our clinical trial

enrollment criteria, requiring evidence of poor urine output for at least eight consecutive hours post-transplantation, allows for both DGF and SGF patients to be enrolled in the study.
In response to this significant burden, in July 2019 a U.S. Presidential Executive Order was issued outlining a comprehensive approach to improving kidney health. It outlines multiple policy initiatives to address the substantial and growing challenges related to ESRD and transplantation.
Included were initiatives to increase kidney transplants in order to reduce the economic and patient burden of dialysis and to increase the utilization of available kidneys by improving regulations relating to deceased-donor organs. As part of this effort, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publicly announced its goal of doubling the number of kidney transplants by the year 2030. As a result, we expect the number of new transplants coming from deceased donors to increase, which may increase the incidence of DGF diagnoses thereby expanding the potential market for ANG-3777.
Our partner Vifor Pharma is responsible for the commercialization of ANG-3777 in delayed graft function globally, except in Greater China.
Delayed Graft Function: Current Treatment Paradigm
There are currently no approved treatments to prevent or reduce the severity of DGF. A successful treatment for post-transplant kidney injury has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for kidney transplant, resulting in the reduction or elimination of the need for dialysis after transplant surgery, reduce the duration of transplant center stay and associated costs and improve the long-term function and survival of transplanted kidneys. Moreover, approximately 20% of the donor kidneys recovered in the United States each year are discarded due to concerns about organ quality and long-term function of the kidney. A therapy that improved long-term kidney function post-transplantation could allow many of these previously-discarded kidneys to be considered viable for transplantation.
Clinical trials have been completed utilizing a variety of therapeutic approaches to DGF, but with very limited success. For example, complement inhibition, anti-apoptotic drugs, novel immunosuppressants, anti-TGF-b molecules, dopamine agonists, N-acetylcysteine and natriuretic peptides, among other interventions, have been tested with inconclusive or negative results. While trends have been observed in some trials, none of these approaches are considered effective therapies for the prevention or mitigation of AKI caused by transplantation or cardiac surgery. As described above, the fact that the injury occurs prior to therapeutic intervention has made it challenging for these interventions to show benefit in reducing the impact of AKI.
For treatment following kidney transplantation, dialysis is intended to keep the patient alive by removing the body's waste products, balancing acid-base status and controlling fluid imbalances until the transplanted kidney recovers from its ischemic injury and begins to function adequately. Dialysis addresses the short-term issue of post-transplant kidney dysfunction, but it does not address the underlying ischemic damage or contribute to repair and recovery of the organ. As the FDA noted in its July 2019 draft guidance Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Transplantation: Developing Drugs for Prevention, dialysis is viewed as an option of last resort and puts the graft at risk of hypotension, thrombosis, increased hospitalization and worse clinical outcomes.
Clinical Development of ANG-3777 for Delayed Graft Function
We have completed a Phase 2 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANG-3777 for improving kidney function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation who show signs of significant kidney injury. In September 2020, we completed enrollment in a Phase 3 registration trial of ANG-3777 to evaluate its ability to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of DGF following kidney transplantation in patients showing evidence of early kidney dysfunction. ANG-3777 has received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for this indication.
Phase 3 Registration Trial
In September 2020, we completed enrollment in our Phase 3 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration trial of ANG-3777 for DGF.
The key enrollment criteria for our Phase 3 registration trial were substantially similar to those used in our Phase 2 clinical trial. To be enrolled, patients were required to have received a kidney graft from a deceased donor

and must have demonstrated oliguria (reduced urine output) for at least eight consecutive hours during the first 24 hours post-transplantation. We selected these criteria to enrich the trial for patients who had demonstrated kidney dysfunction and were thus considered to be at high risk of DGF or SGF. Deceased-donor kidneys with donations after cardiac death were capped at 20% to match current epidemiological data regarding the rate of kidneys donated after cardiac death. Transplant recipients with low or no urine output during any eight consecutive hours over the first 24 hours following transplant were randomized at a ratio of one-to-one to receive a total of three doses of ANG-3777 (2.0 mg/kg intravenous infusion) or placebo once daily for three days. The first dose is administered within 30 hours of transplantation. We enrolled 253 patients across 31 trial sites in the United States. We expect to report topline data from this trial by the end of 2021.
When we initiated our Phase 3 registration trial in 2015, the FDA did not view eGFR as an acceptable endpoint for registration studies and strongly preferred a dialysis-based endpoint. Subsequently, the FDA has agreed with sponsors in other indications that registration studies using eGFR as a primary endpoint may be acceptable in certain circumstances. In July 2019, the FDA's Division of Transplant and Ophthalmology Products released guidance on DGF, indicating that an endpoint of eGFR at 12 months could be sufficient to support a claim of sustained improvement of long-term kidney function. In February 2020, we met with the FDA in a Type C meeting to discuss a proposed change to our Phase 3 trial design to better assess the impact of ANG-3777 on long-term kidney function in transplant recipients with early kidney dysfunction. Based on this discussion and a subsequent March 2020 teleconference with FDA, our planned primary endpoint for our Phase 3 registration trial was changed to be the difference in eGFR between the treatment and placebo arms measured during a twelve-month period following transplant. We believe this eGFR endpoint is an important measure of long-term kidney function and is more predictive than other baseline characteristics in assessing prospects for long-term graft survival. We further believe the eGFR endpoint is a meaningful marker of the extent of recovery from the kidney dysfunction resulting from transplantation. Transplant recipients typically have their eGFR measured on at least a monthly basis to evaluate function. As such, our trial will collect the relevant monthly eGFR data, to support our planned endpoint of eGFR during the twelve-month period following transplantation. Additionally, we are collecting data on key secondary endpoints, including duration on dialysis and duration of hospital length of stay. We are also collecting safety data throughout the trial and comparing graft failure rates at a Day 360 evaluation visit.
Following our protocol amendment, in July and December 2020, the FDA issued correspondence indicating that we could submit the eGFR at 12 months post-transplant data for review as part of an NDA for ANG-3777 in DGF, while reiterating the concerns and guidance it previously communicated to us with respect to the change in our Phase 3 primary endpoint to eGFR from duration of dialysis. Specifically, the FDA stated it did not agree with the change in primary endpoint and other protocol changes at this time. The FDA's correspondence indicates that the ultimate acceptability of eGFR as a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in this population, will depend on our ability, based upon the totality of the Phase 3 data, to show clinical benefit and positive efficacy trends on eGFR as well as on some key secondary endpoints and other measures. Such Phase 3 data will need to demonstrate the reliability of our Phase 3 eGFR data as a sufficient basis for the assessment of clinical benefit, and to establish and provide adequate evidence of the minimum clinically meaningful difference for improvements in eGFR at 12-months. We believe that our amended Phase 3 protocol is appropriately designed to meet these requirements and to address the FDA's concerns on these topics. However, if our Phase 3 results are not persuasive enough, additional evidence of efficacy will be required to substantiate the treatment benefit for purposes of NDA approval for patients with DGF.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial
Our Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ANG-3777 for improving kidney function in patients undergoing transplantation who showed signs of kidney injury and were considered to be at high risk of DGF. Transplant recipients with low or no urine output during any eight consecutive hours over the first 24 hours following transplant were randomized to receive a total of three doses of ANG-3777 once daily for three days (2.0 mg/kg IV infusion). The first dose had to be started within 36 hours of transplantation. The pre-specified primary endpoint was time to production of 1,200 cc of urine over 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean serum creatinine, change in the biomarkers serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), incidence of DGF (defined as dialysis within the first seven days post-transplantation), number of dialysis sessions, length of transplantation-related hospitalization and acute graft rejection.
In 2014, based on a recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), we amended our Phase 2 study protocol to include an administrative interim analysis of the clinical data after the first 20 patients were

enrolled. Consistent with the DSMB findings, we found that the study had generated sufficient data indicating responses of renal transplant recipients following administration of ANG-3777. We subsequently requested a Type C meeting with the FDA to submit the results from our analysis. Following that meeting, we ended the Phase 2 clinical trial and initiated our Phase 3 registration trial.
A total of 28 patients (19 in the ANG-3777 treatment arm and 9 in the placebo arm) were enrolled and randomized, which constitutes the intent-to-treat analytic group. Patient baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the ANG-3777 and placebo arms. In addition, the Irish Nomogram for predicting the likelihood of delayed graft function was essentially equivalent across ANG-3777 arm and placebo at 49.6% and 51.0%, respectively.
ANG-3777 demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements as compared to placebo on the primary endpoint as well as a key secondary endpoint, mean serum creatinine. As reflected in the following figure, at Day 28, 83% of patients in the ANG-3777 arm had achieved greater than 1,200 cc urine output over 24 hours, versus 50% in the placebo arm, though such results were not statistically significant (p=0.09). In addition, the median number of days to achieve the primary endpoint was five for the ANG-3777 treatment arm and fourteen for the placebo arm. Though urine production was similar between groups on Day 1 after transplantation, ANG-3777 patients showed greater increases in urine production during the subsequent two weeks. Two subjects, one from each arm, were excluded from the pre-specified primary endpoint analysis as they reached greater than 1,200 cc urine output over 24 hours prior to the start of first infusion of study product.
Phase 2 DGF Primary Endpoint: Production of 1,200 cc Urine Over 24 Hours
We also conducted a post-hoc analysis with respect to our Phase 2 clinical trial data in response to the March 2017 FDA Draft Guidance for Industry on Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Transplantation and for purposes of planning our Phase 3 clinical trial. Three post hoc analyses were conducted and included mean eGFR at screening, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Month 6, and Month 12 by study arm, graft failure over the first 12 months after transplantation by study arm, and duration of dialysis during first 28 days post-transplantation by study arm. None of these variables nor analyses were pre-specified secondary endpoints. Based upon the post hoc analyses and subsequent interactions with the FDA, the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 study of ANG-3777 in DGF is eGFR at 12 months.
As reflected in the following figure, compared to placebo, the results of the post hoc analysis from the Phase 2 clinical trial showed patients treated with ANG-3777 had a statistically significant higher eGFR at 12 months compared to placebo.

Phase 2 DGF: ANG-3777 Patients Showed Greater Increases in eGFR
The administration of three doses of ANG-3777 in the Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a durable benefit to eGFR compared to placebo across the time points starting at Day 14, with statistical significance (p=0.039) at the 12-month mark. In addition, the absolute difference in eGFR between groups at the 12-month mark was more than double the 5 mL/min/1.73m difference thought to be clinically meaningful. As previously described, our analyses have shown six- and twelve-month eGFR is the best predictors of long-term graft survival in kidney transplantation recipients. In addition, improved eGFR is correlated with significantly increased life expectancies based on the National Kidney Foundation's predictive CKD staging system.
Serum creatinine is the most widely used marker of kidney function and is an essential component in the calculation of eGFR. Higher levels of serum creatinine reflect the decreased capacity for the kidney to remove waste products from the blood and are a marker of kidney dysfunction. In the clinical trial, patients in the ANG-3777 arm had higher serum creatinine than the placebo arm. From Day 14 to 12 months post-transplantation, patients in the ANG-3777 arm had clinically meaningfully lower serum creatinine versus placebo, as reflected in the following figure:

Phase 2 DGF: ANG-3777 Patients Showed Greater Decreases in Serum Creatinine
ANG-3777 was generally well tolerated in the Phase 2 clinical trial. The overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar between the treatment and placebo arms. Two patients in the placebo arm and no patients in the ANG-3777 arm had graft failure within the first year post-transplant. One patient in the placebo arm withdrew after the second infusion for reasons unrelated to study drug; all others completed the study. Adverse events attributed to ANG-3777 were all mild or moderate and included two instances of nausea and vomiting, two instances of infusion site reaction and one instance of blood phosphorous and blood potassium decrease. No discontinuations resulted from these adverse events. No serious adverse event was attributed to ANG-3777 by investigators.
ANG-3777 for Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury
Disease Overview
Acute kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery is another form of AKI. During cardiac surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (the use of a heart-lung machine) is often employed to support the patient's heart and lung function. The use of cardiopulmonary bypass during the surgical procedure may cause or exacerbate kidney injury as a result of reduced blood flow, non-pulsatile circulation, rupture of red blood cells creating oxidant damage and other causes. CSA-AKI is caused by many factors, including shear stress during cardiopulmonary bypass and injuries from nephrotoxic drugs and contrast agents. In addition, an important driver of CSA-AKI is ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is similar to the injury seen in DGF. Furthermore, a significant number of patients undergoing cardiac surgery are also burdened by pre-existing conditions, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, putting them at increased risk for developing AKI.
A diagnosis of AKI is associated with prolonged hospital lengths of stay, the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an increased risk of death. Currently, there are no approved therapies for either prevention or treatment of AKI in the setting of cardiac surgery. Care of patients with CSA-AKI is largely supportive in nature and is focused upon managing the complications associated with AKI, which include life-threatening fluid overload, electrolyte abnormalities and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Treatment in these cases includes the administration of high-dose diuretics and/or renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis or hemofiltration. Renal replacement therapies, though lifesaving, have no impact on recovery of the kidney function and are poorly tolerated in a significant number of these patients due to their underlying cardiovascular disease.
CSA-AKI is one of the most common significant non-cardiac complications after cardiac surgery, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. There is also a direct correlation between length of illness with AKI and long-term

survival, with those patients having AKI for greater than or equal to seven days having significantly diminished survival. Furthermore, patients who exhibit signs of CSA-AKI have longer ICU stays, longer overall hospital length of stay and higher readmission rates. They are also at increased risk for development of CKD and permanent kidney impairment, leading to long-term dialysis and a possible need for transplantation. As such, the development of CSA-AKI results in a significant cost burden to the healthcare system. In one study, U.S. patients who developed CSA-AKI incurred a total hospital cost nearly 60% (approximately $16,000) higher than those cardiac surgery patients who did not suffer kidney dysfunction.
Given the high mortality burden and financial cost of this disease, there have been numerous studies conducted in an attempt to address CSA-AKI. Several large and well-controlled trials for CSA-AKI have been conducted, including trials of dopamine agonists, diuretics, mannitol, a2AR agonists, n-acetylcysteine, statins, theophylline, pentoxifylline, diltiazem, sodium bicarbonate, and more recently a bone morphogenic protein-7 agonist, THR-184 (Thrasos Therapeutics); however, thus far, clinical development has failed to yield an approved therapy.
Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury: Market
CSA-AKI is a frequent complication of cardiac surgery, with approximately 150,000 cases per year in the United States and Europe, or nearly one-third of the approximately 450,000 coronary bypass and valve replacement surgeries performed annually in the United States and Europe.
Pursuant to the Vifor License, Vifor Pharma is responsible for the commercialization of ANG-3777 for CSA-AKI globally, except in Greater China.
Clinical Development of ANG-3777 for Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury
Given the similar causality between CSA-AKI and DGF (predominantly ischemia-reperfusion) and given our Phase 2 results in DGF, we believe ANG-3777 could play a significant role in the treatment of CSA-AKI by activating the HGF/c-Met pathway.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial
We are currently enrolling a Phase 2 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate ANG-3777 in patients at risk for developing CSA-AKI. The planned primary endpoint for this trial is mean area under the curve (AUC) of the percent increase in serum creatinine above baseline, starting from 24 hours after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery through Day 6. An additional important endpoint is the occurrence of Major Adverse Kidney Events at 90 days (MAKE 90), which has previously been accepted by the FDA as the primary endpoint for a registration trial in this indication. A MAKE 90 "event" is death, initiation of renal replacement therapy or a greater than 25% decline in eGFR that is present 90 days after the surgery. We plan to enroll approximately 240 patients at trial sites in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Georgia. Patients will be randomized at a ratio of one-to-one to receive four intravenous doses of 2.0 mg/kg of ANG-3777 or placebo. The first dose is given within four hours of the completion of surgery with subsequent doses being given at 24-hour intervals.
We expect to report topline data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777 for CSA-AKI in the second half of 2021. As is normal for Phase 2 studies, our primary objective is to obtain sufficient evidence of efficacy of ANG-3777, so we may appropriately power a Phase 3 registration trial.
Another important objective of the Phase 2 clinical trial is to evaluate potential patient enrichment elements for the Phase 3 registration trial. The Phase 2 clinical trial is enrolling patients with existing kidney disease and other patient criteria that increase the risk for developing AKI. However, many cases of CSA-AKI occur in patients who are not considered high-risk pre-operatively. As a result, we are collaborating with academic and commercial groups to identify biomarkers capable of being used intraoperatively or immediately post-operatively to assess which patients have laboratory findings that indicate they may be developing AKI. We expect this will enable us to enhance our enrollment in the Phase 3 registration trial with a greater percentage of patients who have evidence of kidney injury predictive of the development of AKI, potentially allowing for faster enrollment, a smaller overall trial and a more clear pharmacoeconomic value proposition as a commercial product. If our Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrates sufficient evidence of efficacy of ANG-3777, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 registration trial for CSA-AKI in the first quarter of 2022, subject to discussions with the FDA.

Commercialization of ANG-3777 for Delayed Graft Function and Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury
If ANG-3777 is approved for DGF and/or CSA-AKI, we expect that it will be commercialized by Vifor Pharma at its cost pursuant to the Vifor License in the United States, Europe and other markets (excluding Greater China). Within Greater China, Sinovant is responsible for the development and, if approved, commercialization of ANG-3777 for all indications. There are approximately 250 institutions performing 23,000 kidney transplants in the United States annually, with the top 150 institutions accounting for over 85% of all kidney transplants each year. Vifor Pharma has an extensive commercial infrastructure addressing the renal market within and outside the United States, including distribution, contracting, medical affairs and sales functions. As a result, we believe Vifor Pharma is well positioned to successfully address these market opportunities by leveraging its strong existing relationships within the nephrology community. The Vifor License has a total potential deal value of up to $1.925 billion (subject to certain specified reductions and offsets), plus tiered royalties on net sales of ANG-3777 at royalty rates of up to 40%.
Pursuant to the Vifor License, we expect Vifor Pharma will execute a reimbursement strategy to obtain a New Technology Add-On Payment (NTAP) for ANG-3777 in the United States. An NTAP provides additional payment to hospitals above the standard Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) payment amount. The NTAP payments are intended to offset a significant portion of the costs for new therapies until the costs of those therapies can be incorporated into revised DRG payment amounts. When certain criteria are met, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), may provide incremental reimbursement for up to 65% of the cost of therapy, in addition to the standard DRG payment. We have completed analyses to support a successful NTAP approval with a third-party expert and believe we will meet the criteria to establish reimbursement of up to 65% of the cost of ANG-3777, and have provided such analysis to Vifor Pharma. Outside the United States, Vifor Pharma will be responsible for interacting with regulatory authorities and health systems to negotiate the price in each individual market.
ANG-3777 for Acute Lung Injury
Disease Overview
Acute lung injury and the more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a spectrum of lung disease characterized by the sudden onset of pulmonary edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and impaired oxygenation. Current treatment strategies for ARDS include mechanical ventilation and antibiotics, which are the standard of care under certain treatment guidelines. Mechanical ventilation, while potentially life-saving, can exacerbate lung injury in ARDS. Antibiotics are generally given prophylactically to prevent secondary infection related to ARDS as opposed to treating the ARDS itself. There are no approved pharmacologic options for treating or preventing ARDS. Common causes of ALI and ARDS include sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, viral or bacterial pneumonia, inhalational injury (smoke or chemicals), trauma and large blood transfusions.
ARDS is generally defined by the 2012 ARDS Task Force "Berlin" definition. Key components of the Berlin definition are acute hypoxemia in ventilated patients receiving certain levels of positive end expiratory pressure and demonstration of non-cardiogenic bilateral opacities on imaging studies, with the severity graded based on the PaO2/FiO ratio into mild, moderate and severe ARDS.
The most extensive epidemiologic study of the incidence of ARDS comes from the global LUNG SAFE study, which analyzed data from over 29,000 patients from ICUs in 50 countries. The study found 10.4% of all ICU admissions had ARDS per the Berlin definition. Moreover, the study showed clinicians missed 40% cases of ARDS in general and 20% in cases of severe ARDS. Mortality from ARDS is high (40%) and is correlated with ARDS severity: 34.9%, 40.3% and 46.1% mortality rates for mild, moderate and severe ARDS, respectively. Despite improved diagnosis and medical management of ARDS patients, average mortality rates have remained steady at greater than 40% for the last 20 years.
The scientific literature indicates HGF and c-Met play important roles in mitigating the extent of lung injury, specifically in reversing alveolar damage and slowing lung fibrosis. A number of publications have demonstrated the essential role of HGF in maintaining the lung endothelial cell barrier following a variety of insults to the lung. In addition, studies indicate its importance in attenuating lung injury during influenza infection. For instance, an animal model of influenza pneumonia investigating exogenous HGF and oseltamivir (an antiviral drug) demonstrated that the administration of HGF in combination with oseltamivir improved outcomes over oseltamivir alone. In addition, we have completed several preclinical studies of ANG-3777 in ALI and ARDS models, which have shown results analogous to AKI models, namely that administration of ANG-3777 reduced apoptosis, increased cell proliferation,

maintained lung architecture, improved pulmonary function and decreased mortality regardless of the mechanism by which the lung damage was induced. For a discussion of such preclinical studies, see "—ANG-3777 Phase 1 and Preclinical Results."
Market
There have been a number of studies analyzing the incidence of ARDS, indicating incidence rates of ARDS between 150,000 and 200,000 cases per year in the United States, resulting in between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.
Clinical Development of ANG-3777 for Acute Lung Injury
Phase 2 Clinical Trial
Over the past 15 years, three respiratory viruses have attracted significant attention because of the high proportion of affected patients who develop critical illness and ARDS: influenza, (particularly influenza A H1N1 2009); Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Recently, a fourth virus emerged, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the proximate cause of COVID-19. In severe cases, COVID-19 is often complicated by pneumonia, ARDS and multi-organ failure, including AKI, neurological injuries and cardiac injuries. In particular, recent multi-site studies from the United States show that 22% to 36% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had acute kidney injury and 3% to 14% required dialytic intervention.
Pneumonia is an inflammatory injury of the lung caused by a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. Bacterial pneumonia is the most common cause of ARDS, although influenza and other viral infections can cause ARDS directly or cause injury to the lung which allows a bacterial superinfection to take hold and cause ARDS. In the LUNG SAFE study, approximately 60% of the cases of ARDS were associated with pneumonia. Research on viral pneumonia (both in influenza and COVID-19) has provided evidence the virus itself may not be the primary or only cause of mortality or morbidity. Viral load has not been clearly shown to correlate with mortality in influenza pneumonia and a regenerative response to the injuries caused by the virus and the immune system can improve outcomes.
Given the results of our preclinical studies of ANG-3777 in ALI and ARDS and the role of HGF and c-Met play in mitigating the extent of lung injury, we believe that ANG-3777 could play a significant role in the treatment of ALI in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who are at high risk of progressing to ARDS. As a result, in order to evaluate ANG-3777's potential to treat this form of ALI, we initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in Brazil to investigate ANG-3777 for this purpose.
We are conducting a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in Brazil with 100 subjects with severe disease. To be enrolled in the trial, subjects must be admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 disease and either require non-invasive mechanical ventilation or have insufficient blood oxygen saturation while on high flow oxygen administration. The primary endpoint is survival free from the need for mechanical ventilation or dialysis at 28 days. We completed enrollment in this trial in March 2021.
The study is designed as a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the impact of ANG-3777 on ARDS as well as acute injuries to the kidney associated with COVID-19. We powered the trial so that only a substantial improvement in the primary endpoint will result in a statistically-significant outcome. As such, we are primarily looking for a proof of concept in the form of an efficacy signal and clues as to the magnitude of effect. Based upon the magnitude of any signal detected in the trial, we will evaluate whether to initiate a Phase 3 registration trial or whether additional Phase 2 clinical trials will be helpful. In addition, we continue to evaluate development options in other common causes of ALI/ARDS, including other forms of pneumonia, sepsis, inhalation injury, or shock/trauma-associated ARDS. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2021 and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in an ARDS indication in 2022.
ANG-3777 for Central Nervous System Indications
The Role of the HGF/c-Met Pathway and ANG-3777 in the Central Nervous System
The role of the HGF/c-Met pathway in repair of damage to organs in the central nervous system (CNS) has been broadly studied. Several studies have shown that HGF is a multipotent growth factor functioning as a novel

Table of Contents

neurotrophic factor for a variety of neurons and many animal models have demonstrated HGF is a powerful neurotrophic factor with beneficial activity. For example, when studying animal models of acute spinal cord injury, researchers determined c-Met, the specific receptor for HGF, spikes sharply while the release of endogenous HGF is relatively modest. This mirrors the HGF/c-Met timing mismatch described in other acute organ injuries. Introducing HGF to the model via the use of an HGF-expressing viral vector significantly increased neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, angiogenesis and axonal regeneration, reduced total damage and promoted functional recovery in rats after spinal cord injury. Based upon these promising data in mice, a Japanese biotech firm (Kringle Pharma) conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter Phase 1/2 trial of recombinant human HGF in 43 patients with selected acute spinal injuries. Data demonstrated trends (p-values ranging from p=0.05 to p=0.10) towards benefit in motor improvement at measurement points between 84 and 168 days. A Phase 3 trial in acute spinal cord injury patients has been initiated.
Cerebral ischemia, or stroke, is a form of acute brain injury related to loss of blood flow to the brain from blocked blood vessels and causing irreversible degenerative damage to brain neurons. While several drugs are approved to prevent strokes or subsequent strokes in certain populations, there is no FDA approved therapy for treating the damage caused by strokes. HGF is a potent pro-angiogenic (regeneration of blood vessels) drug and it also protects endothelial cells against cell death, which we believe may be particularly important since mature neurons cannot duplicate themselves. Additionally, the lack of oxygen caused by the stroke activates a fibrotic process resulting in scarring of neurons and brain tissue. HGF is reported to be capable of inhibiting or decreasing scar formation, which is critical for nerve regeneration and functional reconstruction. Acute delivery of HGF has also been shown to induce long-term neuroprotection with enhanced motor coordination recovery with the promotion of neuron survival continuing even after treatment discontinuation.
Clinical Development Plan
We are planning to submit an IND application for an acute CNS indication in 2021 and initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of ANG-3777 in 2022. Based on our preclinical research and the findings of other researchers, we believe ANG-3777 could be beneficial in treating patients with acute spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and stroke.
ANG-3777 Phase 1 and Preclinical Results
In a Phase 1 safety study, we administered ANG-3777 intravenously to 20 healthy volunteers in ascending doses ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 6.0 mg/kg and placebo to five volunteers. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported across the dose range evaluated; therefore, the highest dose evaluated (6.0 mg/kg) was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. The only treatment-related severe adverse event was headache, reported by one patient in the ANG-3777 arm. No dose-related trends were seen for the incidence of adverse events.
ANG-3777 has been studied for safety and activity in numerous in vitro studies and acute organ injury preclinical models, including in the kidney, heart, spinal cord and brain. During these studies and models, ANG-3777 demonstrated the following key properties:
▪c-Met dependency. In vitro studies demonstrated ANG-3777 acted through the c-Met pathway and was dependent upon c-Met for its activity. As seen in the following figure, in the presence of a selective c-Met inhibitor (siRNA against MET), neither HGF nor ANG-3777 showed an appreciable increase in proliferation of cells following administration of the test compound. In the presence of a mock-siRNA serving as a control agent that does not inhibit c-Met, ANG-3777 and HGF both showed robust increases in cell proliferation (p-values of Mock siRNA vs. MET SiRNA for ANG-3777 and HGF were all below 0.05, as reflected in the figure below). Together, these experiments demonstrate that activity of both HGF and ANG-3777 was dependent upon the presence of functional c-Met. Furthermore, the lack of activity when c-Met is inhibited shows that ANG-3777 and HGF did not act directly to cause proliferation nor did they act through alternative, non-inhibited pathways.

c-Met Dependency of ANG-3777
▪Selective binding to c-Met receptor. In preclinical in vitro models, ANG-3777 activated c-Met without acting on other growth factor receptors. Additionally, the c-Met downstream pathway ERK/MAPK showed activation when c-Met was activated by ANG-3777. These findings demonstrate that in such models ANG-3777 selectively bound to c-Met and induced at least some of the same key repair pathways naturally activated by HGF/c-Met binding. The data demonstrating these differences is shown below, where differences in bandwidth indicate c-Met and Erk (which are downstream of c-Met) both show activation while other receptors do not.

ANG-3777 Selectively Activated HGF Receptor c-Met in Schwann Cells
▪Substantially longer half-life. ANG-3777 has demonstrated a substantially longer half-life of approximately three hours compared to a half-life of less than five minutes for native or recombinant HGF. As a result of ANG-3777's improved half-life, we are administering it as a once-daily dose in our ongoing clinical trials.
▪Expanded therapeutic window. We have demonstrated in a comparative study in a canine AKI model how intervention with ANG-3777 following a 24-hour delay in the administration of the first dose has resulted in similar responses when compared to intervention with ANG-3777 either prophylactically or at the time of the initial injury. In this model, ANG-3777 resulted in similar measurements of serum biomarkers of kidney injury (serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)) when the first dose of ANG-3777 was administered 24 hours after the ischemia-reperfusion injury occurred compared to initiating the first dose at the time of the reperfusion injury, as reflected in the following figure.

Therapeutic Window of ANG-3777
In addition to the foregoing properties, ANG-3777 has been shown in preclinical in vivo models to generate responses in other examples of acute organ injury, including kidney, lung, CNS and heart injuries. In multiple animal studies evaluating ANG-3777, we have consistently demonstrated activity across different species, organ systems and acute organ injuries due to a variety of causes (including, mechanical, thermal, chemical and ischemic causes).
Additional ANG-3777 Preclinical Studies: Lung
In an in vitro study we conducted to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in 4MBr-5 bronchial epithelial cells, both HGF and ANG-3777 significantly stimulated the proliferation of 4MBr-5 bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, administration of ANG-3777 led to a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of necrotic cells compared to vehicle treated cells (p=0.001), while the reduced necrosis observed in the HGF-treated cells was not found to be statistically significant. Overall, these in vitro cell-based assays show that ANG-3777 mimicked the effect of HGF by promoting 4MBr-5 bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and protecting them from H2O2-induced cell apoptosis and necrosis.
In an in vitro study we conducted to further investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on cell proliferation, ANG-3777 mimicked the effect of HGF and induced proliferation in c-Met-receptor-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial and rat Schwann cells. In addition, similar to HGF, the proliferative effects of ANG-3777 were absent in mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which lack the HGF receptor c-Met. In the study, (3H)-thymidine incorporation was utilized to measure cell proliferation with the different interventions. ANG-3777 increased (3H)-thymidine incorporation in HUVEC and demonstrated similar activity to HGF stimulation of HUVEC proliferation (p=0.006 vs. vehicle). ANG-3777 and HGF also increased (3H)-thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner in rat Schwann cells. In NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which do not express the c-Met receptor, neither HGF nor ANG-3777 stimulated cell proliferation (p>0.05). Taken together, these data indicate ANG-3777 and HGF similarly promoted cell proliferation in endothelial and Schwann cells.
In an in vivo study we conducted to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on radiation-induced lung injury in mice (adult male C57BL/6 mice (n=26)), administration of ANG-3777 appeared to improve survival after radiation exposure, but the result was not statistically significant. In the same study, in radiation-exposed mice that were treated with ANG-3777, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) turbidity was significantly reduced compared to the vehicle-treated cohort (p=0.0027), indicating that ANG-3777 significantly reduced pulmonary infiltration resulting from radiation exposure. These data show that treatment with ANG-3777 appear to attenuate radiation-induced acute lung injury.
In an in vivo study we conducted to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on pulmonary ischemia reperfusion in rats (adult male Sprague Dawley rat (n=10)), arterial blood samples were collected for determination of pH, PaO2, SaO2 and PaCO2 to evaluate metabolic and respiratory status. Administration of ANG-3777 led to statistically significant (p<0.05) changes in blood pH levels and SaO2 levels, but only led to a strong trend in PaO2 levels (p=0.055). No effect on blood PaCO2 levels was observed. These data demonstrate that treatment with ANG-3777 improved blood pH and oxygenation levels.

We have also conducted an in vivo study to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice (n=27 adult male C57BL/6 mice). LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Administration of ANG-3777 attenuated LPS-induced acute lung injury. In the study, lung weights in the LPS-exposed, vehicle-treated mice were increased compared to sham-treated animals and although there was a positive reduction in lung weights of mice treated with ANG-3777, the results were not statistically significant. However, the lung injury score in LPS-exposed vehicle-treated animals was significantly increased compared to sham control animals and ANG-3777 significantly reduced the histological lung injury score compared to vehicle-treated LPS-exposed animals (p=0.0048). In addition, ANG-3777 reduced the TUNEL staining intensity, although this effect was not found to be statistically significant. Taken together, treatment with ANG-3777 attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, which we believe it could mean it would potentially be useful in the treatment of ALI.
In studies we conducted to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on bleomycin-induced pulmonary edema in mice (adult male C57BL/6 mice (total n=82), administration of ANG-3777 after bleomycin instillation significantly reduced pulmonary edema resulting from bleomycin exposure. In this study, we administered ANG-3777 and vehicle treatment three hours after bleomycin instillation. The wet-to-dry weight and wet/dry lung weight ratio in the bleomycin-exposed vehicle-treated animals were increased compared to sham instilled animals, and ANG-3777 reduced these increases significantly (p<0.05). Stained lung sections were also examined in this study for pulmonary histology. Lungs from animals exposed to bleomycin treated with vehicle showed marked red cell and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs, while this was much less commonly observed in the lungs of the ANG-3777 treatment cohort. In a second study, therapy was started 24 hours after bleomycin instillation. The wet-to-dry weight and wet/dry lung weight ratio in the bleomycin-exposed vehicle-treated animals were increased compared to sham instilled animals, and ANG-3777 treatment again reduced these increases significantly (p<0.05).
We conducted in vivo studies to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on acute lung injury due to lung-specific TGFß1 overexpression in mice (transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible lung-specific expression of TGFß1, n=46; 28 male and 18 female) Administration of ANG-3777 stimulated pulmonary tissue proliferation, decreased pulmonary cellular apoptosis, lung caspase-3 staining and decreased mortality. In one three-day study, in vehicle-treated doxycycline-exposed animals, mortality measured after three days was 25% (2 out of 8; both females), while all ANG-3777-treated animals (n=8) were alive. However, this difference was not statistically significant at the end of three days. Lung caspase-3 staining was significantly decreased, however, in the three-day study in ANG-3777-treated animals (p=0.017), indicating ANG-3777 potentially protects lung cells from TGFß1-induced apoptosis. In a second, 10-day study, in vehicle-treated doxycycline-exposed animals, mortality measured after 10 days was 73.3%, with a median survival time of 6.0 days. In ANG-3777-treated doxycycline-exposed animals, mortality measured after 10 days was 13.3%, and a median survival time could not be calculated due to a small number of deaths in this group. A statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test (a statistical significance test used in the analysis of contingency tables) showed a significant survival benefit and a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test comparing the two cohorts also showed a significant survival benefit as a result of ANG-3777 treatment (p=0.0008) compared to vehicle treatment.
An in vivo study we conducted to investigate the effect of ANG-3777 on Chlorine (Cl2)-Induced lung injury in mice (adult male C57BL/6 mice (n=66)) showed that ANG-3777 resulted in a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the BAL fluid protein content compared to Cl2 -exposed vehicle treated animals. This indicates that ANG-3777 significantly reduced pulmonary infiltration caused by chlorine exposure.

Additional ANG-3777 Preclinical Studies: Heart
Administration of ANG-3777 in a rat model of acute ischemic injury to the heart (acute myocardial infarction or heart attack) demonstrated a highly significant reduction in infarct size in the ANG-3777 treatment arm compared to the control animals. ANG-3777 demonstrated this response despite the fact that the first dose was administered 48 hours following the initiation of the ischemic injury.

Additional ANG-3777 Preclinical Studies: Central Nervous System
In a New Zealand white rabbit model of acute spinal cord damage, we scored motor function on a scale of zero (representing complete recovery) to five (representing a total loss of limb function). In this model, administration of ANG-3777 improved neurological function as measured by lower neurological deficit scores compared to controls, as reflected in the following figure.

We have also studied ANG-3777 in a male Wistar rat model of acute brain injury due to stroke. In the study, administration with ANG-3777 demonstrated a statistically-significant reduction in the extent of brain injury as measured by infarct size.
Brain Infarction Size
(4 hour Delayed Treatment)
We collaborated with researchers at Duke University, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School on an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the CNS distribution and activity of ANG-3777 associated with acute ischemic injuries. The results were published in the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism and demonstrated good penetration of ANG-3777 across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with very good distribution in the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla, and the spinal cord relative to exposure blood levels. In one of the analyses in the paper, 40 rats were randomized 21 to ANG-3777 and 19 to vehicle. Rats either had temporary (A) or permanent (B and C) or cerebral artery occlusion. Rats in groups A and B were 10-12 weeks old, rats in group 3 were aged (22

months). Two vehicle and six ANG-3777 rats died prior to the final analysis at day 28, with the causes of death unable to be determined. Rats were then given a neurological deficit score, with a score of zero being no neurological deficit and a score of 48 being the maximum possible worst score. As shown in the figure below, ANG-3777 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the magnitude of neurological deficit in each of the groups studied. (Group A p< 0.0001, Group B p=0.007, Group C p=0.009, all ANG-3777 versus vehicle).
Neurological Deficit Score
Additional ANG-3777 Preclinical Studies
Given the well-publicized effort to target c-Met for the treatment of cancer, we performed a number of safety analyses to ascertain whether ANG-3777 causes tumorigenesis (initiation of cancer) or enhances the growth of existing tumors (promotion of cancer). In clinical studies, ANG-3777 is administered for only three or four doses, which is unlikely to be a sufficient exposure to cause tumorigenesis based on the literature on HGF and animal models studied both by us and by independent researchers. We completed multiple animal studies demonstrating ANG-3777 had no enhancing effect in murine tumor models. In c-Met positive pancreatic, colon and brain tumor cells, tumors were given time to become established. In all three models, animals were treated with either vehicle or various doses of ANG-3777. These models demonstrated no increase in the growth of tumors with ANG-3777 compared to vehicle.
Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute demonstrated c-Met suppressed tumor growth in a liver cancer model. Immunodeficient mice were implanted with A431 (c-Met positive) squamous cell carcinoma cell line transfected to express increased HGF with no effect on tumor cell growth in mice.
ANG-3070, Our Second Product Candidate
Our second product candidate, ANG-3070, is a highly selective, orally-bioavailable small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor (TKI) developed internally as a potential treatment for fibrotic diseases, particularly in the lung and kidney. ANG-3070 has demonstrated proof of concept in a variety of animal models as an anti-fibrotic agent and has shown in vitro the ability to inhibit pro-fibrosis tyrosine kinases at levels achievable with oral administration.
Within fibrosis, we believe there is promising therapeutic potential for ANG 3070 in primary proteinuric diseases, a group of kidney diseases characterized by excess urinary protein excretion, and in non-proteinuric kidney disease at high risk of progression. We have entered into a collaboration agreement with The Regents of the University of Michigan, providing us with access to the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) in order to find additional markers of fibrosis and risk of progression in nephrotic syndrome patients. The goal of this collaboration is to allow us to select an enriched set of patients for future studies where ANG-3070 may be most likely to provide a clinical benefit based on the overlap between the apparent disease-driving networks in these patients and the kinase inhibition profile of ANG-3070. In December 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled healthy-volunteer study in Australia to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food effect of ANG-3070, comprised of both, single-and multiple-ascending dose cohorts. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial of ANG-3070 in 2021 and are considering indications such as primary proteinuric renal disease patients and potentially non-proteinuric renal diseases at high risk of progression. We aim to enroll patients with a variety of syndromes in this trial, grouping patients with multiple disease types and/or similar fibrotic disease-related biomarkers into a single trial.

Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and Fibrotic Diseases
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are known to affect a wide array of biochemical pathways, including the mediation of tissue inflammation and fibrosis. TKIs are one of the largest classes of newly approved drugs, with more than 25 approved molecules worldwide targeting a limited number of pathways believed to affect relevant diseases. However, tyrosine kinases are ubiquitous proteins and there is significant overlap in their structures and binding sites. This can lead to binding against unintended tyrosine kinase targets and these off-target effects are largely responsible for the toxicity associated with TKIs.
To date, we have focused our research efforts on the key fibrotic pathways impacted by tyrosine kinases the intersecting nodes between these pathways, and the correlation of genomic and proteomic signatures for different types of fibrosis within these known pathways. This precision medicine approach enabled us to design ANG-3070 with improved specificity and receptor-binding affinity to deliver promising activity in fibrotic pathways while limiting off-target inhibition. In preclinical models, IND-enabling toxicology studies and in preliminary data from our Phase 1 healthy-volunteer trial, ANG-3070 was well tolerated at pharmacologically-relevant doses and exposures.
ANG-3070 was designed with the intent of enhancing the activity of kinases involved in reducing inflammation and the progression of fibrosis. Four kinase receptors targeted by ANG-3070 include platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFRa and PDGFRb, respectively) and Discoidin Domain Receptors 1 and 2 (DDR1 and DDR2). ANG-3070 has demonstrated potent, low nanomolar IC50s (a standard measure of drug potency) to these tyrosine kinase receptors as shown in the figure below. These four tyrosine kinase receptors are implicated in a number of diseases and targeting them effectively could provide a therapeutic benefit to patients across a variety of different diseases.
Disease Overviews and Markets
Fibrosis is a part of the body's natural healing response to organ injury. When it becomes dysregulated, fibrosis can be highly detrimental to a normal organ's architecture and function, potentially leading to death. Two major organs commonly impacted by fibrosis are the kidney and the lung.

Primary Renal Diseases
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis (GN, the inflammation of the cells in the kidney responsible for filtering the blood) globally and is responsible for between 10% and 20% of all GN in the United States. The prevalence in estimated at up to 150,000 in the United States. IgAN is caused by deposits of immunoglobulin A in the glomeruli thereby disrupting renal function and causing blood in the urine (hematuria) and abnormal levels of proteins in the urine (proteinuria). IgAN progresses steadily over time, with approximately 30% to 40% of patients developing ESRD over 20 to 30 years, including 20% of children developing ESRD within 20 years of diagnosis. Like other primary renal diseases with high rates of nephrotic syndrome, there are no approved therapies specifically for IgAN.
Alport's Syndrome (AS) is a genetic renal disease and is the second most common inherited cause of kidney failure. AS affects approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people in the United States. AS is caused by a genetic defect in type IV collagen, a component of the glomerular basement membrane in the kidney, resulting in defects in its structure and function. In some patients with inherited AS, the disease can progress very rapidly leading to kidney failure in early adulthood. As in other forms of CKD, progressive fibrosis plays an important role in the pathophysiology and progression of AS. With no approved therapies to stop progressive loss of kidney function, AS represents a rare disorder with significant unmet need.
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a rare form of nephrotic disease (disease in which kidney damage allows proteins to leak into the urine) in which scar tissue develops in the glomeruli, the structures in the kidneys responsible for filtering waste from the blood. FSGS accounts for about 40% of adults with nephrotic syndrome and about 20% of children with nephrotic syndrome. In many cases, the cause of FSGS is unknown (idiopathic). In other cases, the scarring may occur because of another condition such as HIV infection, sickle cell disease, obesity, autoimmune diseases or genetic causes. It is estimated that FSGS affects up to 40,000 patients in the United States, with a similar prevalence in Europe. More than 5,400 patients in the United States are diagnosed with FSGS every year, a number likely underestimated because of the limited number of biopsies performed to confirm the diagnosis. The disease affects those of African descent more than other demographics. Current treatments for FSGS, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, are effective only in 25% to 35% of patients. Both of these therapeutic options were developed decades ago for other indications and have been repurposed for FSGS given no approved therapy exists for this indication.
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
IPF is characterized by progressive scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs, which leads to their deterioration and destruction. Over time, patients' lung scarring progresses and breathing becomes difficult, often resulting in the lungs failing to take in enough oxygen to meet the body's needs. IPF is an aggressive form of lung disease with a median survival of two to three years from diagnosis. The course of the disease is highly variable. Certain patients become seriously ill within a few months, while others may survive for five years or longer. Most deaths in IPF occur from progression of lung fibrosis leading to respiratory failure. According to the NIH, approximately 100,000 people in the United States have IPF, and approximately 30,000 to 40,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, usually affecting people between the ages of 50 to 70. EU incidence rates are estimated to be similar. Over half are undiagnosed in the mild category alone, while more could be underdiagnosed. The disease is of unknown cause and represents an important unmet medical need.
There are currently two approved therapies for IPF, pirfenidone (Esbriet®, sold by Roche/Genentech) and the TKI nintedanib (OFEV®, sold by Boehringer-Ingelheim). Despite neither therapy having a demonstrated impact on patient survival, the two drugs generated approximately $2.3 billion in combined 2018 worldwide sales. OFEV use is associated with undesirable gastrointestinal side effects and liver toxicity. If approved for IPF and successfully commercialized, we would expect ANG-3070 to compete with these two approved drugs. However, there is no guarantee that ANG-3070 will generate comparable revenues.
Our Solution: ANG-3070 for the Treatment of Chronic Fibrosis
By targeting tyrosine kinases receptors involved in fibrogenesis such as PDGFRa, PDGFRb, DDR1 and DDR2, ANG-3070 could be an important potential therapeutic addressing a number of fibrotic conditions in primary renal diseases and IPF. To explore the applicability of ANG-3070 to various diseases with fibrotic etiologies, we have conducted a number of preclinical in vivo animal studies.

Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) induced kidney injury is a frequently used model of glomerular injury and proteinuria. We completed studies in a rat PAN model associated with proteinuria similar to the human disease, FSGS. ANG-3070 treatment in this model significantly reduced proteinuria compared with the vehicle (placebo) treatment as reflected in the following figure.
 ANG-3070 Reduced Proteinuria in a PAN
Model of Renal Disease
Data from this model indicate treatment with ANG-3070 significantly mitigated peritoneal fluid accumulation (p<0.001), a quantitative measure of ascites production, which is a clinically-relevant endpoint often associated with proteinuric kidney disease. Decreased proteinuria and improved renal function were also seen. Glomerular hypertrophy, a measure of glomerular dysfunction, was also reduced by ANG-3070 (p<0.05). Glomerular COL-3 accumulation, a measure of scarring, was also reduced (p£0.05). Overall, the data suggest use of ANG-3070 for the treatment of proteinuric kidney disease as is observed in steroid refractory focal segmental glomerulosclerosis warrants further investigation.
We also administered ANG-3070 in a 5/6 nephrectomy, or remnant kidney, model in rats, a model commonly used to simulate chronic renal disease and kidney adaptation to progressive loss of nephrons (functional units within the kidney). In the study, administration of ANG-3070 reduced both proteinuria (as measured by albuminuria) and markers of collagen deposition (hydroxyproline (HYP) the end result of fibrosis) in an apparent dose-dependent manner, as reflected in the following figures.
ANG-3070 Attenuated Renal Dysfunction in Remnant Kidney Model in Older Rats
In CKD, the rate of protein excretion in the urine (proteinuria) is a strong predictor of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. A spontaneous or treatment-induced reduction in proteinuria is associated with a reduction in the risk of adverse outcomes. The connection is well-established enough that a reduction in proteinuria has been accepted by the FDA as a surrogate endpoint for drug approval in primary glomerular diseases.

One of the most widely used models of lung fibrosis uses endotracheal administration of bleomycin, a chemotherapeutic agent, to induce fibrosis, replicating many elements of IPF. We evaluated pulmonary fibrosis using picrosirius red staining and levels of TGF-b (a pro-fibrotic cytokine) to assess ANG-3070's effects on markers of lung fibrosis. On both measures, ANG-3070 showed significant reductions relative to vehicle.
Taken together, the data from this model indicate therapeutic intervention with ANG-3070 significantly decreased lung weights, lung hydroxyproline, lung histopathological score, picrosirius red collagen staining and TGFb 1 staining compared to a bleomycin-exposed vehicle control animals. Each of these measures is reflective of a decrease in pulmonary fibrosis, or scarring of the lung, typical in fibrotic lung diseases like pulmonary fibrosis.
Additional preclinical in vivo studies have further demonstrated the potential activity of ANG-3070 in fibrotic diseases. These include in vivo studies examining the effect of ANG-3070 in the following models:
▪In a pulmonary fibrosis model using transgenic mice with lung-specific overexpression of TGFb-1, oral administration of ANG-3070 significantly decreased, compared to vehicle, lung fibrosis in transgenic mice overexpressing TGFb1 in the lung. In particular, ANG-3070 significantly decreased, compared to vehicle, lung fibrotic score by the Ashcroft scale (p=0.005), collagen content as measured by hydroxyproline (p=0.005) and fibrotic marker aSMA (p=0.026) expression. ANG-3070 also decreased, compared to vehicle, PSR staining signal, however the results were not statistically significant (p=0.053).
▪In a bleomycin-induced scleroderma/systemic sclerosis mouse model, treatment with ANG-3070 in established scleroderma/SSc significantly decreased dermal thickness and skin histopathological injury/fibrotic score as compared to vehicle (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). ANG-3070 treatment also reduced lung weight (p<0.01), lung hydroxyproline (p<0.01) and lung fibrotic score (p<0.05), and decreased kidney hydroxyproline (p<0.001) and picrosirius red staining (p<0.05). As such, ANG-3070 demonstrated anti-fibrotic improvement in the skin, lung and kidney.
▪In a rat DOCA/Salt model of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction resembling human FSGS, oral administration of ANG-3070 reduced renal damage (p<0.001), renal fibrosis (p<0.05), proteinuria (p<0.001) and albuminuria (p<0.05).
Clinical Development of ANG-3070
In December 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Australia to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food effect of ANG-3070 in healthy volunteers. Enrollment in the study is now complete and we expect to report data on this study in the first half of 2021.
As of December 2020, 97 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in the study with 72 receiving ANG-3070 and 25 receiving placebo to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food effect of ANG-3070. 
As represented in the figure below, in Part A, healthy volunteers were given ascending single doses of ANG-3070 ranging from 50 mg to 600 mg to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food effect of ANG-3070 at different doses. We are investigating an additional cohort of 600 mg to further assess the effect of food on ANG-3070 dosing. In Part B, healthy volunteers were given either twice-daily doses ranging from 50 mg to 500 mg under fasting conditions over two weeks or once-per-day doses ranging of 400 mg and 600 mg with meals over two weeks.

We received preliminary pharmacokinetic and food effect data, plus blinded safety and tolerability data, from this study, with a cutoff date of December 2, 2020. As of the cut-off date, ANG-3070 was generally well-tolerated at all doses and there were no Serious Adverse Events reported at any dose schedule or level in the preliminary safety reports. The reported (non-serious) Adverse Events (AEs) were seen mostly at higher doses, 600 mg administered once-daily and 500 mg administered twice-daily over two weeks. These AEs included nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Generally, these AEs were mild to moderate.
In the single-dose cohorts where ANG-3070 was taken without food, ANG-3070 was rapidly absorbed with a maximum level in the bloodstream 1-2 hours post dosing. The half-life of ANG-3070 was 10 hours at the 400 mg single doses. Inter-subject variability was generally moderate to low, meaning most subjects in the same ANG-3070 dose cohort had similar pharmacokinetics. The Phase 1 data available thus far show ANG-3070 has a good dose-exposure relationship and we believe ANG-3070 has the potential to be used as a once-daily oral anti-fibrotic therapy, if approved.
The multiple-dose cohorts where ANG-3070 was taken for two weeks twice a day without food saw similar ANG-3070 pharmacokinetic data as was seen in the single-dose cohorts when comparing the same dose levels. ANG-3070 did not significantly accumulate in the bloodstream after 14 days of dosing.
When ANG-3070 was taken with food, the maximum bloodstream absorption of ANG-3070 was delayed and the blood concentration (Cmax) was reduced when compared to the data observed when ANG-3070 was administered at the same dose fasted. However, total drug exposure as measured by area under the curve was not different whether ANG-3070 taken with or without food. This indicates administration with food may mitigate potential side effects without compromising efficacy.
We believe the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data support the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial. Subject to the final results from this trial and discussions with the FDA, we plan to advance ANG-3070 into Phase 2 clinical development in 2021, and we are considering indications, such as primary proteinuric renal diseases and potentially non-proteinuric renal diseases at high risk of progression.
ROCK2 Inhibitor, Our Third Product Candidate
Our third product candidate is a highly selective, orally-bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of ROCK2 developed internally as a potential treatment for fibrotic and other diseases. We expect the first indication for our ROCK2 inhibitor to be a chronic fibrotic indication such as CKD, IPF or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Given the heterogeneity of these diseases, we believe this program will benefit from our precision medicine approach and use of established clinical biomarkers to guide patient selection and monitoring.
ROCK2 in Fibrotic and Other Diseases
Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) signal transduction pathways are implicated in the development of fibrosis. Inhibition of the ROCK isoforms ROCK1 and ROCK2 has shown promise in treating fibrosis in animal models. However, use of a non-isoform-specific ROCK inhibitor (i.e., dually inhibits ROCK1 and ROCK2)

has been associated with inducing hypotension. Recent scientific work using specific genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ROCK2 indicates ROCK2 inhibition alone can result in anti-fibrotic activity without causing hypotension. These findings informed our strategy to develop ROCK2-specific inhibitors as a potential treatment for fibrosis.
Multiple dual ROCK1/2 inhibitors have received regulatory approval, including ripasudil (Glanatec®), which is approved in Japan for treating glaucoma and ocular hypertension, fasudil (ErilTM), which is approved in Japan and China for treating cerebral vasospasm in hemorrhagic stroke, and netarsudil (Rhopressa®), which is approved in the United States for the treatment of glaucoma. A ROCK2-selective inhibitor belumosudil is currently under review by the FDA for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Elevated expression of ROCK2 has been implicated in a number of chronic fibrotic conditions and other diseases. ROCK2 is significantly upregulated in fibrotic kidneys in both pediatric and adult patients, with ROCK2 levels positively correlated with the severity of the fibrosis. Study of ROCK2 inhibition in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of kidney fibrosis showed ROCK2 inhibition alleviates renal fibrosis. Furthermore, in a mouse model of IPF, researchers found mice with either ROCK1 or ROCK2 genetically deleted were protected from bleomycin-induced IPF, indicating specifically targeting either ROCK isoform would be an effective therapeutic strategy against IPF. ROCK2 expression in vitro has also been associated with co-expression of fibrotic liver markers. Elevated ROCK2 levels are seen in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. ROCK2 has also been shown to play a role in neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we believe a potent ROCK2 inhibitor should prevent disease progression in chronic fibrotic diseases and potentially be useful in a variety of other cardiac and neurodegenerative disorders.
Dual ROCK1/2 inhibitors have problematic side effects including hypotension and increased vascular permeability. In an in vitro analysis measuring binding affinity for ROCK2 and ROCK1, our ROCK2 selective inhibitors show much stronger binding affinity for ROCK2 versus ROCK1. We believe high selectivity for ROCK2 could provide enhanced tolerability, potentially supporting long-term systemic use.
We expect to select a lead compound from our ROCK2 inhibitor program in 2021.
CYP11B2 (Aldosterone Synthase) Inhibitor Program
Aldosterone is a hormone produced in the adrenal glands which helps control the body's blood pressure by causing the kidneys to retain salt and excrete potassium, thereby increasing water retention, blood volume and blood pressure. CYP11B2 is a member of the broad cytochrome P450 family, and is responsible for the biosynthesis of aldosterone. There are a number of diseases associated with dysregulated aldosterone, including primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome), refractory hypertension, congestive heart failure and kidney fibrosis. As a result, we believe that inhibition of CYP11B2 could potentially be used in aldosterone-related diseases.
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is responsible for producing aldosterone to maintain blood pressure. Two major approaches to modulating the RAAS pathway are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are eighteen FDA-approved ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and while these drugs are generally quite effective in controlling hypertension, aldosterone breakthrough or escape happens in approximately 10% to 50% of patients depending on the duration of therapy studied and the definition of 'breakthrough'. Aldosterone excess is estimated to be the primary cause in approximately 20% of patients with resistant hypertension, or nearly 2 million patients in the United States alone.
Two mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), spironolactone and eplerenone, plus a late-stage compound (finerenone), are also involved in blocking the effects of aldosterone. MRAs act by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor to prevent aldosterone from having its biologic effect on blood pressure and renal excretion and absorption of salt and potassium. Both approved MRAs have the downside of increasing circulating levels of aldosterone, leading to increased activity of aldosterone through its non-MR mechanisms. Aldosterone acts on the vascular system by inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction through both MR-dependent and MR-independent pathways. As such, increased levels of aldosterone has direct deleterious effects on the progression of congestive heart failure and kidney fibrosis.
We are leveraging our extensive experience in developing cytochrome P450 modulators to develop compounds with improved specificity for CYP11B2 relative to CYP11B1. In non-human primate models, one of our lead test compounds markedly reduced aldosterone production following an ACTH challenge while having a minimal

impact on cortisol production. We expect to select a lead compound from our CYP11B2 inhibitor program and initiate IND-enabling studies for the program in 2021.
Manufacturing
We rely upon third party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply product candidates for our clinical trials, and we will rely on such manufacturers to meet commercial demand. We expect this strategy will enable us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure, avoiding dependence on our own manufacturing facility and equipment, while simultaneously enabling us to focus our expertise on the clinical development and future commercialization of our products. Currently, we rely on and have agreements with a single third party contract manufacturer to supply the drug substance for ANG 3777 and with a single third-party contract manufacturer to manufacture all clinical trial supplies of ANG 3777, and we expect to enter into commercial supply agreements with such manufacturers prior to any potential approval of ANG 3777. We currently have sufficient inventory of ANG 3777 to meet all requirements for our planned clinical trials. We expect to complete process validation steps for ANG 3777 in 2022 and, at such time, we expect to have enough drug inventory for at least two years.
ANG 3777 drug substance is manufactured via conventional organic synthetic procedures, starting from raw materials and reagents commercially available in large quantities. ANG-3777 drug product is manufactured via conventional pharmaceutical processing procedures, employing commercially available excipients and packaging materials. The procedure and equipment employed for manufacture and analysis are consistent with standard organic synthesis or pharmaceutical production, and are transferable to a range of manufacturing facilities, if needed.
Prior to the first regulatory approval of ANG-3777 for DGF or CSA-AKI in the United States or the European Union, Vifor Pharma will assume responsibility of the commercial manufacture of ANG-3777 for such indications in accordance with a supply agreement to be negotiated in good faith between Vifor Pharma and us. Vifor Pharma's right under the Vifor License does not restrict our rights to develop and manufacture ANG-3777 globally for non-Renal Indications or in support of the Sinovant License, subject to certain protections for Vifor Pharma consistent with the terms of the Vifor License.
Similarly, we rely on and have agreements with a single third-party manufacturer to supply drug substance for ANG 3070 and a separate single source third party manufacturer to supply clinical trial supplies of ANG 3070.
We are in discussions with third party manufacturers to find additional suppliers to produce our other product candidates.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Although we believe our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies in the treatment of acute organ damage and our other therapeutic areas, our competitors may be able to develop other compounds, drugs, or therapies capable of achieving similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the development and commercial success of our product candidates will be whether or not such product candidates are deemed to be safe and effective by relevant regulatory authorities, as well as their tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, and reimbursement.
There is currently limited competition for ANG-3777 in the nephrology space. Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has an anti-p53 siRNA molecule, QPI-1002. In December 2018, Quark's majority shareholder, SBI Holdings, announced QPI-1002 failed to meet its prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of a reduction in dialysis days in a Phase 3 registration trial for DGF prevention. Quark is also currently investigating QPI-1002 for CSA-AKI in a Phase 3 trial based on results observed in a pre-defined subgroup of patients in a Phase 2 trial. In addition, we are aware of Astellas Pharma Inc. and Alloksys Life Sciences B.V., which are advancing ASP1128 and bRESCAP respectively for AKI following coronary artery bypass graft and/or valve surgery. ASP1128 is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial whilst bRESCAP is in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial.

In ALI, for COVID-19, there are a number of preventative vaccines in development with one receiving an Emergency Use Authorization approval and another nearing regulatory approval. Vaccine coverage and efficacy will be less than 100%, in our view, necessitating therapeutic intervention for these patients. There are hundreds of clinical trials examining various methods of treating COVID-19 related acute lung injury. To date, only a small number of these trials have resulted in data positive enough for regulators to approve therapeutics on either an emergency use or permanent basis. Therapeutics receiving Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 patients include but are not limited to co-administration of casirivimab and imdevimab from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., baricitinib (in combination with remdesivir), and bamlanivimab from Eli Lilly, and remdesivir from Gilead Sciences, Inc. In ARDS, there are no approved therapies but a number of companies have Phase 3 programs under way in the United States including brexanolone from Sage Therapeutics, ravulizumab from Alexion, siltuximab from EusaPharma (UK) Limited, alteplase from Boehringer Ingleheim, MultiStem from Athersys, ruxolitinib from Incyte, and aviptadil from NeuroRX.
In an effort to expand ANG-3777's therapeutic area, we are currently exploring indications associated with the central nervous system. We are aware of Athira Pharma's ATH-1017, a small molecule that enhances HGF/c-Met activity and it is currently in two Phase 2 clinical trials for Alzheimer's Disease. Other programs targeting the HGF/c-Met pathway is Kringle Pharma's KP-100, a recombinant human HGF. KP-100 is currently being investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and a Phase 3 trial for acute spinal cord injury in Japan.
With respect to ANG-3070, in fibrosis-related primary renal diseases clinical programs in this space include bardoxolone methyl from Reata Pharmaceuticals, Lademirsen from Sanofi Genzyme, Sparsentan from Retrophin, Bleselumab from Astellas Pharma, and Tesevatinib from Kadmon Holdings. In IPF, there are two approved therapies, pirfenidone (Esbriet®, sold by Roche/Genentech) and nintedanib (OFEV®, sold by Boehringer-Ingleheim). There are several programs currently in development for IPF, including an anti-CTGF antibody from Fibrogen, Inc., a GPR84 inhibitor and an ENPP2 inhibitor from Galapagos NV, a Wnt-pathway inhibitor from United Therapeutics Corporation/Samumed, LLC.
With respect to competition for our ROCK2 inhibitor, netarsudil ophthalmic solution from Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was first approved by the FDA in 2017 as a topical agent for reducing intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Other competition in clinical development include Kadmon Holdings, Inc.'s belumosudil (KD025), a ROCK2 inhibitor with reduced selectivity against ROCK1, in the clinic for several indications, including chronic graft versus host disease, systemic sclerosis and IPF. We are also aware of other ROCK2 inhibitors in preclinical development.
Regarding competition for our CYP11B2 inhibitor, PhaseBio's CYP11B2 inhibitor PB6440 is preparing for Phase 1 trials in 2021 in treatment resistant hypertension. CinCor Pharma's RAAS pathway inhibitor CIN-107 is in Phase 2 trials for resistant hypertension and primary aldosteronism.
Across each of our development areas, other, potentially competitive, clinical-stage technologies are being developed. Also, companies developing preclinical molecules could decide to pursue development in our chosen indications and potentially compete with us. This could lead to commercial challenges as well as difficulties enrolling clinical trials if they were to target the same indications we are pursuing.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes and know-how are important to our business. We pursue various avenues of intellectual property protection, including consideration of patent, trademark, and trade secret strategies. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our programs relating to small molecule compounds that have HGF-like activities (including ANG-3777), our tyrosine kinase inhibitors (including ANG-3070), our ROCK2 inhibitors and our CYP inhibitors. Our patent strategy seeks to protect our product candidates by filing patent applications, in the United States and in relevant foreign jurisdictions, and we pursue multi-faceted protection, as available, for example to relevant small molecule compounds and analogs, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of manufacture and use. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in order to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection for certain intellectual property that may be important to the development of our business, and expect to pursue trademark registrations for brand names or other text or images that may provide commercial value.
In the United States and worldwide, issued patents have a presumptive term, assuming all maintenance fees are paid, of twenty years from their earliest non-provisional filing date. Certain jurisdictions offer opportunities to 
40


Table of Contents

extend this term. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may add term to a patent (referred to as Patent Term Adjustment) if delays by the USPTO of certain activities exceed prespecified durations, from which delays by the Applicant are subtracted. Additionally, many jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, provide opportunities for extending the term of patents relating to approved pharmaceutical products or their approved uses. In the United States, a single patent can be extended per approved product, for a period (referred to as Patent Term Extension) of up to five years, depending on the dates of patent issuance relative to submission of an application for premarketing approval (i.e., of a New Drug Application or a Biologics License Application) under provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar restoration of term is available in Europe under so-called Supplementary Protection Certificate rights, and extensions under similar policies may be available in other countries.
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of ANG-3777 and our other product candidates, if any, one or more of our patents may be eligible for limited Patent Term Extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, Supplementary Protection Certificate in Europe.
Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and/or other intellectual property protection for our current and future product candidates, including for their use, production, formulation, etc., with commercially relevant terms; our commercial success may also depend in part on our ability to successfully defend our patent and/or other intellectual property rights against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell and/or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable intellectual property rights that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to establish sufficient ownership rights to ensure complete or necessary control over our intellectual property rights as required in order to obtain, maintain, and/or enforce them. For these and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property." The expiration dates of the patents discussed below assume in all cases that the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid to maintain the patent(s) in force for the full extent of their term and any extension(s) thereof.

Collaboration with the University of Michigan
In 2019, we entered into a subcontractor agreement with The Regents of the University of Michigan (UM), under which we provide funding for a study of ANG-3070 in nephrotic kidney disease. Under this agreement we obtain access to the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), an integrated group of academic centers, patient support organizations and clinical resources dedicated to advancing the treatment of kidney disorders. The goal of work under this agreement, which we support through a grant from the DOD, is to identify human disease and drug response profiles based upon the genes, networks and pathways that correlate with the therapeutic activity of ANG-3070 in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and other fibrotic diseases. We are obligated to provide to UM up to a total of $520,000 over the course of the project. We have an option to license and commercialize intellectual property generated during the term of the agreement that is solely owned by UM under commercially reasonable terms. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drugs, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new drug can be marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA clinical holds, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;
▪submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
▪approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) representing each clinical site before a clinical study may be initiated;
▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
▪preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA);

Preclinical and Clinical Studies
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and any available human data or literature to support use of the product in humans. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site's IRB before a study may be initiated at the site, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. Each year, sponsors must submit an annual progress report to FDA detailing the status of the clinical trial(s) under an IND, and sponsors must timely report to FDA any serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol, or any findings from other preclinical or clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. Sponsors generally must also register and report ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. NIH, ClinicalTrials.gov.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
•Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
•Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development and testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA's goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that relevant study data was obtained in compliance with GCP requirements.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.

As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug's risks, or other elements to assure safe use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, all REMS programs must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy following implementation.
Further, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety and efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the changes can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that supporting the original approval, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates, one or more of which may be available for our current or future products.
New drug products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for Priority Review. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
After an NDA is submitted for a product, including a product with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, the NDA may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as Priority Review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. Depending on whether a drug contains a new molecular entity, Priority Review designation means the FDA's goal is to take action on the marketing application within six to eight months of the 60-day filing date, compared with ten to twelve months under standard review.
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires 
46


Table of Contents

as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product with Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to Orphan Drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan Drug exclusivity. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee.
A designated Orphan Drug may not receive Orphan Drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received Orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Pediatric Use and Exclusivity
Even when not pursuing a pediatric indication, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trials the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The FDA must then review the information submitted, consult with the sponsor, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
Separately, in the event the FDA issues a Written Request for pediatric data relating to a drug product, an NDA sponsor who submits such data may be entitled to pediatric exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity which, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product's FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
▪fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
▪product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
ANDA Approval Process
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through the NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these generic equivalent drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains (among other things), data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. However, premarket applications for generic drugs are termed "abbreviated" because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to a referenced proprietary drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic drug with a strength or dosage form that differs from the referenced proprietary drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA suitability petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced proprietary drug or is intended for a different use and it is not otherwise subject to an approved suitability petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
505(b)(2) NDAs
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for 
48


Table of Contents

the applicant and which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2) can serve as a path to approval for modifications to previously approved drugs, such as new indications, formulations, dosage forms, or other conditions of use. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the approved reference drug is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies for the new product. The FDA may approve the new product for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to submit certain information to the FDA regarding any patents with claims covering the applicant's product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of the NDA, each of the patents is listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant that subsequently files an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing the approved drug must certify to FDA, with respect to each patent listed for the approved drug in the Orange Book: (1) that no patent information was submitted to the FDA; (2) that such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a "paragraph IV certification." For method of use patents, in lieu of submitting a certification, the applicant may elect to submit a "section viii statement" certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use.
If an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all the listed patents claiming the reference product have expired.
If an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant provides a paragraph IV certification with its application, the applicant must send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference product and all patent holders for the patent at issue within 20 days after the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder and patent owners may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement suit within 45 days of the NDA holder's or patent owners' receipt of the notification regarding the paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest to occur of 30 months from the date the paragraph IV notice is received, the expiration of the patent, the settlement of the lawsuit or a court decision that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owners do not bring a patent infringement suit within the 45-day period, they may later bring a patent infringement suit under traditional patent law, but it will not invoke the 30-month stay of approval.
Separate from applicable patent terms and the 30-month stay of approval for paragraph IV applications, the FDA will also refrain from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all applicable non-patent exclusivity for the reference drug has expired.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
NDA holders may be entitled to different periods of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the approved drug. For example, an applicant may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE) which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been previously approved by the FDA in any other NDA. During the five-year period of NCE exclusivity, the FDA cannot accept any application for a product that contains the same active moiety as the approved NCE; however, the FDA can accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the same active moiety after a four-year period if such application includes a paragraph IV certification.
In addition, a non-NCE drug may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity for a change to a previously approved product, such as a new indication or condition of use, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. In such case, the FDA is precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after the three-year exclusivity period has concluded. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and being the review process during the exclusivity period.
49

Other types of non-patent exclusivity include seven-year Orphan Drug exclusivity and six-month pediatric exclusivity (each discussed above).
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we could become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market our product candidates in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other foreign, federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare

benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and "transfers of value" provided to physicians (as defined by statute), certain other health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, some of which apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a payor-by-payor basis. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific, clinical support, and commercial support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication or considered cost-effective by third-party payors in foreign or national-level systems. In the event that an adequate 
51

level of reimbursement is not established, then even if a product is approved by global regulatory authorities, it may adversely affect the ability of manufacturers to sell such product profitably.

In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain "branded prescription drugs" to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. By way of example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate." On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear when the Supreme Court will make a decision. It is also unclear how other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Data Privacy and Security
Pharmaceutical manufacturers may be subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon "covered entities" (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional

reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers' personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company's data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020, which, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for "protected health information" maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the CPRA was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023.
In Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018, and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of data subjects within the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Relatedly, following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Economic Area and the European Union, and the expiry of the transition period, companies will have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which may expose us to further compliance risk.
