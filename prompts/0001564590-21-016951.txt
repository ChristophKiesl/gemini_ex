ITEM 1, BUSINESS
General
 Genesco Inc. ("Genesco", “Company”, "we", "our", or "us"), incorporated in 1934 in the State of Tennessee, is a leading retailer and wholesaler of branded footwear, apparel and accessories with net sales for Fiscal 2021 of $1.8 billion. During Fiscal 2021, we operated four reportable business segments (not including corporate): (i) Journeys Group, comprised of the Journeys®, Journeys Kidz® and Little Burgundy® retail footwear chains and e-commerce operations; (ii) Schuh Group, comprised of the Schuh retail footwear chain and e-commerce operations; (iii) Johnston & Murphy Group, comprised of Johnston & Murphy® retail operations, e-commerce operations and wholesale distribution of products under the Johnston & Murphy® brand; and (iv) Licensed Brands, comprised of the licensed Dockers®, Levi's®, and G.H. Bass® brands, as well as other brands we license for footwear.
 Effective January 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Togast LLC, Togast Direct, LLC and TGB Design, LLC (collectively, "Togast").  Togast specializes in the design, sourcing and sale of licensed footwear.  We also entered into a new U.S. footwear license agreement with Levi Strauss & Co. for the license of Levi's® footwear for men, women and children in the U.S. concurrently with the Togast acquisition.  The acquisition expands our portfolio to include footwear licenses for G.H. Bass and FUBU, among others.  Togast operates in our Licensed Brands segment.  
 At January 30, 2021, we operated 1,460 retail footwear and accessory stores located primarily throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico, but also including 93 footwear stores in Canada and 123 footwear stores in the United Kingdom and the ROI. We plan to open a total of approximately 15 new retail stores and to close approximately 35 retail stores in Fiscal 2022.
 The following table sets forth certain additional information concerning our retail footwear and accessory stores during the five most recent fiscal years:
 
 
 | Fiscal 2017 | | | Fiscal 2018 | | Fiscal 2019 | Fiscal 2020 | | Fiscal 2021 |

We also source, design, market and distribute footwear under our Johnston & Murphy brand and the licensed Levi's, Dockers and G.H. Bass brands, as well as other brands that we license for footwear to over 1,000 retail accounts in the United States, including a number of leading department, discount, and specialty stores.

COVID-19
 Impacts related to the novel coronavirus global pandemic (“COVID-19”) have been significantly adverse for the retail industry, our Company, our customers, and our employees. We have experienced significant disruptions to our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing and shelter-in-place recommendations and mandates, which initially resulted in the temporary closure of a number of stores and furlough of our employees. During Fiscal 2021, as stores were impacted by negative mall traffic, we focused on our digital capabilities. As of January 30, 2021, the vast majority of our stores in North America had reopened, although we continue to see residual impacts on foot traffic and in-store revenues.  As of January 30, 2021, essentially all of the stores in the United Kingdom and the ROI remained closed.
 The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are discussed in further detail throughout this Business section, Item 1A - Risk Factors, and Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Strategy 
 Across our company, we aspire to create and curate leading footwear brands that represent style, innovation and self-expression and to be the destination for our consumers' favorite fashion footwear.  Each of our businesses has a strong strategic position grounded in a deep and ever-evolving understanding of the customers it serves.  The strength of our concepts and the advantages we have built over time have established long-lasting leadership positions that make our footwear businesses outstanding on their own, but what they share through the benefit of synergies, makes them even stronger together.  We have aligned our business around six pillars; 1) build deeper consumer insights to strengthen customer relationships and brand equity, 2) intensify product innovation and trend insight efforts, 3) accelerate digital to grow direct-to-consumer, 4) maximize the relationship between physical and digital, 5) reshape the cost base to reinvest for future growth, and 6) pursue synergistic acquisitions that add growth and create shareholder value.  We anticipate opening fewer new stores in the future, concentrating on locations that we believe will be most productive, as well as closing certain stores, perhaps reducing the overall square footage and store count from current levels, but improving productivity in our existing locations and investing in technology and infrastructure to support omnichannel and digital retailing.
 We have made acquisitions, including the acquisitions of the Schuh Group in June 2011, Little Burgundy in December 2015 and Togast in January 2020, and anticipate that we may pursue acquisitions reactively rather than proactively until we recover further from the pandemic.  We anticipate that potential acquisitions would either augment existing businesses or facilitate our entry into new businesses that are compatible with our existing footwear businesses and core expertise.
 More generally, we attempt to develop strategies to mitigate the risks we view as material, including those discussed under the caption “Forward Looking Statements,” above, and those discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors". Among the most important of these factors are those related to consumer demand. Conditions in the economy can affect demand, resulting in changes in sales and, as prices are adjusted to drive sales and manage inventories, in gross margins. Because fashion trends influencing many of our target customers can change rapidly, we believe that our ability to react quickly to those changes has been important to our success. Even when we succeed in aligning our merchandise offerings with consumer preferences, those preferences may affect results by, for example, driving sales of products with lower average selling prices or products which are more widely available in the marketplace and thus more subject to competitive pressures than our typical offering. Moreover, economic factors, such as persistent unemployment, the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and any future economic contraction and changes in tax policies, may reduce the consumer’s disposable income or his or her willingness to purchase discretionary items, and thus may reduce demand for our merchandise, regardless of our skill in detecting and responding to fashion trends. We believe our experience and discipline in merchandising and the buying power associated with our relative size and importance in the industry segments in which we compete are important factors in our ability to mitigate risks associated with changing customer preferences and other changes in consumer demand.

 The Journeys Group accounted for 69% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021.

 Schuh Group
 The Schuh Group accounted for 17% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021. Schuh Group stores target teenagers and young adults in the 16 to 24 year age group, selling a broad range of branded casual and athletic footwear along with a meaningful private label offering.  At January 30, 2021, Schuh Group operated 123 Schuh stores, averaging approximately 4,825 square feet, which include both street-level and mall locations in the United Kingdom and the ROI.  Schuh Group's e-commerce website is schuh.co.uk.  Schuh Group closed a net of six stores in Fiscal 2021.
Johnston & Murphy Group
 The Johnston & Murphy Group accounted for 8% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021. The majority of Johnston & Murphy wholesale sales are of the Genesco-owned Johnston & Murphy brand, and all of the group’s retail sales are of Johnston & Murphy branded products.
 Johnston & Murphy Retail Operations. At January 30, 2021, Johnston & Murphy operated 178 retail shops and factory stores primarily in the United States averaging approximately 1,900 square feet and selling footwear, apparel and accessories primarily for men in the 35 to 55 year age group, targeting business and professional customers.  Johnston & Murphy retail shops are located primarily in higher-end malls and airports nationwide and sell a broad range of men’s dress and casual footwear, apparel and accessories. Women’s footwear and accessories are sold in select Johnston & Murphy locations. We also sell Johnston & Murphy products directly to consumers through e-commerce websites. The websites are johnstonmurphy.com and johnstonmurphy.ca.  Footwear accounted for 60% of Johnston & Murphy retail sales in Fiscal 2021, with the balance consisting primarily of apparel and accessories. Johnston & Murphy Group closed a net of two shops and factory stores in Fiscal 2021.
 Johnston & Murphy Wholesale Operations. Johnston & Murphy men’s and women's footwear and accessories are sold at wholesale, primarily to better department stores, independent specialty stores and e-commerce. Johnston & Murphy’s wholesale customers offer the brand’s footwear for dress, dress casual, and casual occasions, with the majority of styles offered in these channels selling from $100 to $195.  
 Licensed Brands
 The Licensed Brands segment accounted for 6% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021. Licensed Brands sales include footwear marketed under the Levi's brand, Dockers brand and G.H. Bass brand, among others.  The Levi's brand license was entered into concurrently with the closing of the Togast acquisition.  We have had the exclusive Dockers men’s footwear license in the United States since 1991.  We acquired the G.H. Bass brand license in conjunction with the acquisition of Togast.  In addition, we renewed our men's Dockers footwear license for the United States.  Dockers footwear is marketed to men aged 30 to 55 through many of the same

national retail chains that carry Dockers pants and sportswear and in department and specialty stores across the country. Suggested retail prices for Dockers footwear generally range from $50 to $90.  Togast designs and sources licensed footwear under the Levi's and G.H. Bass brand names, among others, and provides services for the sourcing of FUBU licensed footwear.
 Manufacturing and Sourcing
 We rely on independent third-party manufacturers for production of our footwear products sold at wholesale and our Johnston & Murphy retail business. We source footwear and accessory products from foreign manufacturers located in Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, Portugal, Peru, and Vietnam. Our retail operations, excluding Johnston & Murphy, sell primarily branded products from third parties who source primarily overseas.  
Competition
 Competition is intense in the footwear and accessory industries. Our retail footwear and accessory competitors range from small, locally owned stores to regional and national department stores, discount stores, specialty chains, our vendors with their own direct-to-consumer channels and online retailers. We also compete with hundreds of footwear wholesale operations in the United States and throughout the world, most of which are relatively small, specialized operations, but some of which are large, more diversified companies. Some of our competitors have resources that are not available to us. Our success depends upon our ability to remain competitive with respect to the key factors of style, price, quality, comfort, brand loyalty, customer service, store location and atmosphere, technology, infrastructure and speed of delivery to support e-commerce and the ability to offer relevant products.
Licenses
 We own our Johnston & Murphy® brand and own or license the trade names of our retail concepts either directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Dockers® footwear line, introduced in Fiscal 1993, is sold under a license agreement granting us the exclusive right to sell men’s footwear under the trademark in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The Dockers license agreement expires in 2024.  We entered into a new license agreement with Levi Strauss & Co. in January 2020 for the right to sell men's, women's and children's footwear under the Levi's® trademark in the United States and the Caribbean.  The initial term of the license agreement with respect to Levi's® trademarks is through November 30, 2024 with one additional four-year renewal term. We license certain other footwear brands, mostly in foreign markets. License royalty income was not material in Fiscal 2021.
Wholesale Backlog
 Most of the orders in our wholesale divisions are for delivery within 150 days. Because most of our business is at-once, the backlog at any one time is not necessarily indicative of future sales. As of February 27, 2021, our wholesale operations had a backlog of orders, including unconfirmed customer purchase orders, amounting to approximately $64.6 million, compared to approximately $24.7 million on February 29, 2020. The increase in backlog reflects the acquisition of Togast.  Our backlog may be more vulnerable to cancellation than is typical due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Human Capital
 Our Employees
 We had approximately 19,000 employees as of January 30, 2021 with approximately 16,000 employed in the United States and Canada, and approximately 3,000 in the United Kingdom and the ROI.  The majority of our workforce consists of retail-based, customer-facing employees with approximately 70% part-time and 30% full-time as of January 30, 2021.  
 Our values include treating our customers and each other with integrity, trust and respect, and creating an unrivaled home for talent and diversity to grow and succeed.  We consider our employees to be core to our success.

Employee Health & Safety
 COVID-19
 Importantly, during Fiscal 2021, we faced many disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this time, we took a number of steps to support our employees and customers including:

• | Increased safety and cleaning protocols
--+----------------------------------------


• | Employee safety training and communications
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Modified visitor and travel policies
--+-------------------------------------


• | Strict protocols for employee contact tracing
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Technology investments to allow remote work where possible
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Suspension of meetings and events, utilizing virtual alternatives where possible
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also took action to protect employee wages and benefits during periods of store closings and periods of decreased mall and store traffic.  Specifically, we continued benefits and paid employee premiums for employees on furlough due to store closings and temporarily implemented minimum guarantees in pay for full-time commissioned-based retail store employees.  We also returned all or a portion of salaries lost for employees who were impacted by forced salary reductions.
 Benefits
 We currently offer a comprehensive benefits package designed to meet the diverse needs of our employees.  This package includes many benefits dedicated to our employees’ physical and mental health and well-being as well as benefits designed to help employees build wealth and prepare for the future.  We also provide valuable benefits and protections such as domestic partner benefits, parental leave, paid time for community service, adoption benefits, financial assistance with emergencies, scholarship opportunities, matching gift contributions and a generous product discount. 
Competitive Pay
 Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and to provide incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees.
 Our compensation philosophy is to motivate and retain our employees by offering what we believe to be competitive salary packages.  To align employee objectives with the Company and ultimately our shareholders, we offer programs that reward long-term performance.  We engage a nationally recognized outside compensation consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Employee Engagement
 We are committed to furthering our efforts to cultivate a respectful and inclusive work environment in support of our employees and our business objectives.  We have committed our diversity, equity and inclusion action to four overarching areas – community, talent, business practices and measurement.  
 We routinely conduct annual employee engagement surveys with various segments of our population.  In 2020, we also conducted a diversity, equity and inclusion survey.  We remain committed to listening to and learning from our employees.
 Seasonality
 Our business is seasonal with our investment in inventory and accounts receivable normally reaching peaks in the spring and fall of each year and a significant portion of our net sales and operating income generated during the fourth quarter.  Also, the wholesale backlog is somewhat seasonal, reaching a peak in the spring. We maintain in-stock programs for selected product lines with anticipated high-volume sales.

Environmental Matters
 Our former manufacturing operations and the sites of those operations as well as the sites of our current operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to human health and safety and the environment. These laws and regulations address and regulate, among other matters, wastewater discharge, air quality and the generation, handling, storage, treatment, disposal, and transportation of solid and hazardous wastes and releases of hazardous substances into the environment. In addition, third parties and governmental agencies in some cases have the power under such laws and regulations to require remediation of environmental conditions and, in the case of governmental agencies, to impose fines and penalties. Several of the facilities owned by us (currently or in the past) are located in industrial areas and have historically been used for extensive periods for industrial operations such as tanning, dyeing, and manufacturing. Some of these operations used materials and generated wastes that would be considered regulated substances under current environmental laws and regulations. We are currently involved in certain administrative and judicial environmental proceedings relating to our former facilities.  See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
