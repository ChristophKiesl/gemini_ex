Item 1. Description of Business
Company Background
 
MJ Harvest, Inc. was first established in Nevada in 2002. Beginning in 2017, we focused on building a portfolio of best-in-class products that can benefit farmers and hobbyists in their growing operations. Our first product line consists of the DeBudder Lids and EDGE. The Debudder is used to strip buds off stems for a variety of plants, including hemp and cannabis. We also focused on building an international network of distributors that can service our customers with rapid deliveries of products stocked in country, and developed two e-commerce sites, www.procannagor.com and www.procannagro.ca, with tiered pricing for the distribution of products in the U.S. and Canada. In 2020, we expanded our product offerings to include the Kalix and NPK product lines, which offer customers access to plant nutrient products. Currently, the Company sells the debudder products through several distributors and online to retail customers. The loss of any of our three largest distributors could have a material impact on our sales of debudder products. Our sales of the Kalix and NPK product lines are dependent on the ability of Kalix and NPK to deliver products as ordered by our customers, but the sales of these product lines are not currently a material part of our business.

We continue to seek out additional agricultural and horticultural implements to add to our product offerings through distribution agreements, licensing, and acquisition. In this aspect of our business, we look for agricultural implements, durable goods, and services that will benefit smaller growers of hemp and cannabis by making their growing operations more efficient.
 
In the Spring of 2021, MJHI (www.mjhi.com) evaluated a business opportunity with a vertically integrated marijuana company in Oklahoma, PPK Investment Group, Inc. (“PPK”), and signed a letter of intent to acquire the company following a period of due diligence. In September 2021, we completed an steps to increase our initial investment of $1,000,000 for 10% to $2,500,000 for a 25% interest in PPK and are working with PPK management to expand the business in Oklahoma and other markets. Our agreement with PPK provides for the eventual acquisition of up to 100% of PPK provided the increased ownership can be accomplished in accordance with Oklahoma laws governing licensing of marijuana businesses.
 
With the investment in PPK, our long-term focus has shifted, and we now intend to expand business beyond the hemp and cannabis agricultural product marketing niche to include vertically integrated cannabis growing operations in Oklahoma and South Dakota and we are actively looking at markets in Arizona, California, and Florida as potential areas for expansion. The timing for development of these expanded operations will depend on availability of growth capital.
 
On May 19, 2021, PPK entered into a cannabis joint venture agreement with the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota (“FSST”). Under the joint venture agreement, PPK will open extraction and manufacturing facilities in a building located on the FSST Reservation and will manufacture products for FSST utilizing biomass grown in FSST’s existing and expanding grow operations. FSST markets their products under the Native Nations Brand. PPK currently markets its products in Oklahoma under the Country Cannabis Brand. The joint venture agreement provides that PPK and FSST will now cross market the other’s brand in their respective states. This provides an opportunity for FSST to expand its Native Nations Brand to Oklahoma and for PPK to expand its Country Cannabis Brand into South Dakota. The joint venture also provides both PPK and FSST with additional capabilities, work force, and other synergies that management believes will benefit both entities. MJHI currently participates as a minority investor in PPK and expects its involvement to increase as its PPK investment commitment grows and more capital is provided to PPK and the joint venture.
 
Strategy and Objectives
 
With the initial investment into PPK, and PPK’s cannabis joint venture relationship with FSST, MJHI is poised to take advantage of significant business development opportunities. The following business divisions are either in process, under development, or are being evaluated in an effort to assemble a dynamic enterprise covering all aspects of seed to sale operations in the cannabis and hemp-based CBD sectors. We believe we have selected excellent partners to assist in achieving the strategic vision outlined below.

6

 
Vertically Integrated Cannabis Operations.
 
Through our investment in PPK and our intention to increase the investment over time to make PPK a wholly owned subsidiary, we will operate as a vertically integrated cannabis company encompassing grow operations, harvesting, processing, extraction, manufacturing, distribution, and retail sales of a full line of products containing THC and CBD. In addition to the FSST joint venture, the Company also recently signed an agreement with International Business Group to produce and distribute the Chronic Brand of products in Oklahoma. The agreement includes a right of first refusal to offer the Chronic Brand in other markets as PPK expands its footprint. The ability to add brands to the PPK distribution system will serve to further increase the market reach of PPK and as MJHI increases its investment into PPK, the MJHI market reach and visibility will also expand.
 
We followed the Chronic brand distribution agreement with a similar arrangement to represent the WEEDSY brand in Oklahoma and we are now evaluating another brand for both investment and/or brand distribution.
 
As a result of our brand development efforts, we also became aware of an opportunity to acquire a commercial kitchen operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma with an additional distribution facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Working with PPK, we entered into an asset acquisition agreement with AOK Ventures, Inc. to acquire the commercial kitchen operations, including a sublease on the Oklahoma City distribution facility. The acquisition was structured with PPK acquiring the assets of AOK and with the Company providing a portion of the funding for the acquisition in exchange for a 15% increase in ownership of PPK, bringing the Company’s total ownership of PPK to 25%. The assets include exclusive distribution rights to distribute the Sublime brand of products in Oklahoma with additional opportunities to expand in other states on similar terms.
 
Joint Venture for Manufacturing and Distribution with Tribal Partner
 
FSST is one of 574 Native American Indian tribes recognized by the United States Government. The Flandreau Santee Sioux Reservation is situated on over 5,000 acres of land located along and near the Big Sioux River in Moody County, South Dakota. The reservation facilities include the Royal River Entertainment Complex, which is the only legal casino in South Dakota with 430 gaming devices, a 300-seat entertainment and conference center, a 120-room hotel, an adjacent RV park, plus a full-service restaurant, buffet, snack bar and lounge.
 
 The Tribe has been active in tribal cannabis since 2015 and has a state-of-the-art cultivation facility through which it has resumed cannabis cultivation after the legalization of cannabis in South Dakota in November 2020. The cultivation facility currently houses about 65 strains of cannabis and the Tribe has plans to renovate an existing building to develop a lab, kitchen, packaging, and a dispensary with drive-up service. FSST also has developed a full-line of 2018 Farm Bill Compliant hemp products which it sells under its trade name “Native Nations Cannabis.”

Federal recognition of the sovereign status of Native American Indian tribes under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (the “Act”) allows tribes such as the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe to manage their own affairs, including their assets, land, and mineral rights. The Act and the ensuing legislation were intended to create a sound economic foundation for the inhabitants of the reservations. Two of the main benefits of federal recognition are exemption from payment of federal taxes and exemption from many federal and state licensing requirements applicable to non-tribal companies. As a result of these advantages, many tribes have pursued business opportunities in the gaming and tobacco industries. Now, with the growing legalization of marijuana for medicinal and adult use, we believe marijuana provides a new growth area for tribes. FSST is the first tribe to expand into the marijuana industry in South Dakota. PPK and FSST hope to create a unique business model that can be offered to other tribal entities in a coordinated program to grow the Native Nations brand throughout sovereign lands.
 
Indoor Grow Operations
 
The Company is evaluating several indoor grow operations for acquisition and/or joint venture operations but has not entered into any binding agreements or arrangements. Management believes that securing indoor grow operations would allow the Company’s operating divisions to access a consistent supply of biomass in the quality demanded by the Company’s customers. Management also believes that the acquisition of an existing indoor grow facility would allow the Company to rapidly generate operating cash flows as the biomass is processed by the Company’s own extraction and manufacturing concerns. As indicated above, PPK and FSST both have their own grow facilities in Oklahoma and South Dakota, respectively, which we believe positions us to apply best practices learned from our and their own operations to newly acquired locations. The Company, PPK, and FSST intends to continue to evaluate indoor grow facilities in locations where they are licensed to grow or manufacture products and in new markets where licenses to cultivate and process marijuana can be obtained at reasonable cost.
 
The Company is cognizant of the critical processes that must be addressed to effectively monitor and produce a quality product. Steps considered critical include cultivation monitoring, maintenance and monitoring of plant nutrient, irrigation, and lighting systems during the growing cycles, monitoring of production processes, and knowledge of the market demand for products that customers want and for which they will pay a reasonable price. Management believes all of these aspects of the business could be very efficiently driven by software applications. The Company is currently evaluating several competent software alternatives to address these critical processes and the Company expects to develop procedures and practices to obtain a competitive advantage over less sophisticated producers.
 
Disrupting Cannabis Distributor
 
Once the products are produced, the next critical phase of our strategic vision is in distribution of the products to customers where and when demanded. This is another area where management believes inventory control, data analysis to determine product demand, and delivery systems focused on getting products into the hands of the customers at the lowest delivery cost possible could be driven by software applications. The Company is currently evaluating inventory control systems, consumer data collection systems, and delivery methods to allow efficient distribution of the products to the consumer.

Traditionally, retail distribution is done through brick-and-mortar dispensaries. With the growing reach of Lyft and Uber, and similar business models, last mile delivery is a growth industry. We believe that software applications may also be applied to this aspect of the marijuana industry and we are evaluating solutions that could disrupt the traditional brick-and-mortar dispensary distribution model at lower cost.
 
Farm Implements and Nutrient Products
 
Our goal is to become a preferred provider of agricultural and horticultural products to hemp and marijuana growers and processors. We are targeting small and medium sized commercial growers as well as the hobby farmers prevalent in many areas with recently legalized hemp and marijuana industries. We intend to continue our expansion by building distribution relationships with manufacturers of products that fit in our catalog, and by acquiring rights to manufacture and sell compatible products when those opportunities occur. In the longer term, we intend to open physical warehouse and retail locations on the east and west coasts of the United States and eventually in a central U.S. location in order to optimize logistics for our product sales and distribution efforts. As we build our product lines, we intend to become a one-stop shop for the hemp and marijuana growers looking for ways to improve yield and reduce costs of harvest and processing.
Business Concentration.
 
In the period ended May 31, 2021, our business in the Debudder product line was concentrated with 83% of our debudder sales going to our top three customers. We expect significant changes in our sources of our revenues in the coming periods and the business concentrations for the period ended May 31, 2021 may not reflect future results.
Competition
 
At this point in our development, we believe our competitors in the marijuana and hemp product industries are those companies that are acting as product aggregators and distributors of products similar to ours. To date, the hemp industry (primarily relating to CBD oils) and the cannabis industry, have been fragmented and chaotic with large numbers of small and medium sized companies attempting to develop products and then working to gain a toehold in the burgeoning market for those products. CBD products are currently offered on Amazon, E-Bay, and company specific web sites and the competition for consumer attention is extreme. THC product distribution is more limited and governed by the applicable state regulations in each state permitting sale of THC products, either for medicinal purposes or for adult use. A few larger companies such as Trulieve Cannabis Corp., Charlotte’s Web, and Canopy Growth Corp,, among others, have reached critical mass in terms of brand awareness and market reach, but the Company expects to be able to compete effectively with these larger competitors through effective use of technology, the unique aspects of tribal sovereignty, and the growing market presence in Oklahoma and South Dakota.

The direct competition for distribution of the “picks and shovels” needed by the small growers is significantly less congested. There are some retail offshoots from brick-and-mortar businesses like hydroponics shops that offer a range of tools and implements similar to the Company’s product offerings, and these businesses are likely to compete directly with the Company’s offerings. To date we are not aware of any large nationally recognized distributors of like products and we are attempting to position ourselves as a player at the national level. There are significant hurdles to accomplishing this objective, most significantly, availability of capital to build and maintain the online information needed for a comprehensive “one-stop-shop” offering. If we are unable to find the necessary capital to build our product lines and our online presence, we are likely to face increasing competition as other players enter the market. This could have a negative impact on our ability to grow our revenues and compete effectively in the future.
 
With our expansion into the vertically integrated cannabis space through our investment in PPK, we will be subject to competition for a wider range of industry participants and we expect competition to intensify in the coming periods. We are currently evaluating our sources of direct competition in the Oklahoma and South Dakota markets where PPK is currently operating, and will report on competition experienced by PPK as we develop our history of selling products in these regions.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe our competitive advantage is derived from our ability to pursue opportunities when and where we find them without getting bogged down in the bureaucracy that a larger and more diverse business might face. As a small publicly traded company, we are able to move quickly, rapidly negotiate and document licensing and distribution agreements, and when appropriate, acquisitions.
 
With the acquisition of our interest in PPK (d.b.a. Country Cannabis), and our desire to increase our ownership of PPK to a majority position (up to 100%), we are also now seeking competitive advantages in Oklahoma by expanding the brand pool available to PPK for distribution through the Country Cannabis customer base. By adding brands, including Chronic, Sublime, and Weedsy, MJHI is providing PPK with additional products to offer dispensaries that can be presented at the same time as the usual Country Cannabis sales calls. The potential benefit is increased orders per sales visit and a reduction of selling cost per product across the PPK distribution network.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Historically, our product offerings have been limited to the debudder product line and additional soil enhancement products that we distribute for other manufacturers. We will continue to develop these capabilities as resources allow. Our primary marketing method for the existing products is through our online shopping site, www.procannagro.com, and through a small number of distributors that offer the debudder products to their customers. We do not expect the debudder will be a significant contributor to revenues or profits in the foreseeable future, but we intend to continue our efforts to grow the business.

10

 
Currently, we are also seeking additional business opportunities in the cannabis industry primarily by closely monitoring developments in the cannabis space. When we identify an interesting prospect, our CEO reaches out personally to the management team of the prospect to see if there is a basis for furthering discussions. Our management team also has a long history in the industry and large networks of contacts which provide word of mouth connections to other relevant business prospects. Collectively, we believe we will be able to capitalize on these various connections to build a broad-based business selling products to our customers in the hemp and cannabis space. In the longer term, we intend to pay close attention to other needs of our customers and to meet those needs at the appropriate time with new offerings of products and services, including offering management services, oil extraction capabilities, indoor cannabis growing facilities, manufacturing, distribution, and dispensary locations. If we can secure appropriate funding to expand our product lines, we believe the market for our products will expand.
 
Manufacturing
 
We are not currently manufacturing any products in our own facilities. We rely on third party manufacturers for our production runs, and currently have relationships with third party companies for the manufacturing our products, primarily with Chinese companies. We are monitoring the China tariff situation closely and will take appropriate steps to find new contract manufacturing capabilities in other countries should the China tariffs cause a significant impact on our business. Management believes that alternative manufacturers are available, both in the United States and in other industrialized nations, but it is likely that such other sources of manufacturing would only be available at increased cost. Given current gross margins on the debudder line, an increase in costs may impact the long-term viability of the debudder product line. The molds used to manufacture our products were built by Eco Molding Co., Limited in Guandong, China. We own the molds, but it is our understanding that the molds may not be transferred out of China. Consequently, if an alternate manufacturer outside of China becomes necessary, we may be forced to incur the cost of a new mold, which could further affect the viability of the debudder product line. We do not currently have any outstanding contracts with Eco Molding for production of our product and have historically operated on the basis of purchase orders. Our last order for product was for 10,000 units of the Debudder Edge product. We received our final shipment of these units during the year and they are currently held in inventory for sale to customers. At current inventory and sales levels, we expect that another product order will be necessary within 6 months.
 
Our investment in PPK now also provides the Company with manufacturing capabilities for cannabis products, including pre-rolls, vape cartridges and edible products. While the Company does not manufacture products directly, we will be impacted by our financial interest in PPK and we are continuing to evaluate PPK’s manufacturing operations for the consequences of COVID-19, supply chain impacts, availability of labor, and other matters that could have short or long-term affects on PPK’s operations. To date, we have not determined that there are any outstanding issues that impact PPK’s manufacturing operations, aside from normal and recurring business considerations.

11

 
Intellectual Property
 
Currently, we have two design patents, and several foreign patents covering our debudder products. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued our patents on October 8, 2019. Design Patent D862180 covers the original Debudder Bucket Lid, and Design Patent D862281 covers the Debudder Edge. Our business strategy will continue to focus on intellectual property protections when appropriate. As we research additional products to include in our product catalogue, we include an analysis of the level of protection that is available for such product as an element of our decision to pursue licensing or distribution of that product. Our preference is to license or distribute products that have intellectual property protections, either because of patent pending or patented status, or as a result of trade secrets.
 
We also own the domains for mjhi.com, mjharvestinc.com, and procannagro.com. We utilize mjhi.com as our primary domain, website address and e-mail server address. Procannagro.com is our online shopping site and web based sales tool. Mjharvestinc.com is being pahsed out in favor of mjhi.com, but will likely be retained to protect against confusion caused by third party use if we were to abandon the domain and it became available for others.
 
Government Regulation
 
The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse with no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States (except as disclosed below for epilepsy and related syndromes) and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. Moreover, as of November 30, 2020 and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, 35 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, while 15 of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized marijuana for medical use. As further evidence of the growing conflict between the U.S. federal treatment of cannabis and the societal acceptance of cannabis, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex. Epidiolex is an oral solution with an active ingredient derived from the cannabis plant for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified substance derived from the cannabis plant. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical component of marijuana that does not contain the psychoactive properties of THC.

12

 
Marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities currently do not involve any products that contain THC and we are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in states where we do business, should we enter into a new area that involves THC products, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us.
 
In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of DOJ memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum.
 
The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:
 

1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------


2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------


13

 
On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.
 
President Biden has nominated Merrick Garland to serve as Attorney General in his administration. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy.
 
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 
We are not aware of other specific governmental regulations that impact our business. We do, however, utilize Chinese vendors for manufacturing a significant portion of the products we sell. To the extent that tariffs are imposed on imported goods manufactured in China, our pricing structure and acceptance in the marketplace may be affected. We currently stock our products through distributors in foreign countries when appropriate and ship direct from our manufacturer to the foreign distributor when such can be done at a cost savings. We intend to continue to explore ways that we can hold our costs down on the products we sell in order to minimize price sensitivity concerns with our customers.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We are not aware of any environmental laws that would limit our ability to conduct our current sales and distribution activities in their present form. As we expand our operations to participate more directly in the cannabis and hemp industries, and become a vertically integrated grower, harvester, processor, manufacturer, and distributor of cannabis and hemp products, we will likely be subject to environmental laws, including water usage, recycling, waste disposal, and similar regulations that will vary depending on the location of our facilities. We intend to address the impact of such environmental regulations when we have a specific use case to evaluate.

Organization Within Last Five Years
 
We were originally incorporated under the name HealthGuard International Marketing Corporation, in the State of Nevada on August 15, 2002. At the time we operated under the name HealthGuard International Marketing Corporation, no business was conducted. In 2003, the Company entered into a reverse takeover transaction with a Japanese Investment Group engaged in the business of gaming. After completing the reverse takeover, the Japanese Investment Group failed to implement its business plan and ceased having any contact with the shareholders of the Company. As a result, the Company was dormant until June 27, 2011, when Jerry Cornwell, our president and one of our Directors, took legal action to obtain the appointment of a custodian to regain control over the Company. On August 15, 2011, the Company held a meeting, with the custodian acting on behalf of the Japanese shareholders and approved a private offering of a control block of stock to a new investor. On September 18, 2011 the District Court of Clark County, Nevada entered an order cancelling all of the shares issued to the Japanese Investment Group. The result of this action was to cede control of the Company to the new investor. In late September, the Company undertook a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its total shares outstanding, reorganized the Company under the name EM Energy, Inc., and began seeking oil and gas properties for development.
 
In late 2017, the Board reevaluated the oil and gas development efforts and elected to reorganize again to focus on distribution of agricultural and horticultural implements used by farmers and hobbyists around the world. The Company acquired the rights to the DeBudder product line, including the DeBudder Bucket Lid and the DeBudder Edge, and continues to seek other products for distribution through its distributor relationship and its distribution web site located at www.procannagro.com. In 2018, the Company changed its name to MJ Harvest, Inc. and amended and restated its articles of incorporation to reflect the reorganized business direction. The Company also changed its stock symbol to MJHI (formerly RZPK).
 
These changes were affected in order to make our corporate name and ticker symbol better align with our short-term and long-term business focus. Our current, short-term goals will focus on building our product portfolio while we expand our product sales and build our distribution platform and brand under the www.procannagro.com website.
 
Our long-term plan is to increase our ownership position in PPK and to concurrently acquire one or more cannabis extraction facilities and grow operations where we can develop additional products, build or brands, research the effectiveness of such products in real world settings, and provide concrete examples of the effectiveness of the products to our customers. This step will also allow us to expand operations into biomass production, processing, and sale of products containing THC and CBD. We can offer no assurances that we will be able to accomplish any portion of our long-range vision.

15

 
Employees
 
As of September 10, 2021, we have no employees. All of our activities are outsourced to consultants and independent contractors who provide services to us as needed and as directed by our Chief Executive Officer. Day to day operations are managed by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and their activities are monitored by our Board of Directors. As business activities require and capital resources permit, we intend to hire employees to fulfill our company’s needs.
Facilities
 
The Company does not currently have any physical facilities. Each of our officers and directors operate out of home or virtual offices and we are able to meet remotely as needed. Our physical products are placed at third-party fulfillment centers and are shipped direct to our customers by the fulfillment centers. We expect that physical space will not be required until we experience additional growth and our needs for inventory storage expand.
 
COVID-19
 
In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its rapid spread around the world and throughout the United States prompted many countries, including the United States, to institute restrictions on travel, public gatherings and certain business operations. These restrictions significantly disrupted economic activity in the United States and Worldwide. As of May 31, 2020 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the disruption did not materially impact the Company’s financial statements.
 
The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 and related government responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts to the Company, including our ability to operate. As of September 10, 2021, there were no material adverse impacts to the Registrants’ operations due to COVID-19.


The economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 could also adversely impact the impairment risks for certain long-lived assets. Management evaluated these impairment considerations and determined that no such impairments occurred as of May 31, 2021.
