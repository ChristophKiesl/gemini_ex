DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
Corporate Summary
 
American Rebel Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on December 15, 2014 in the State of Nevada and is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock of $0.001 par value. 
 
American Rebel is boldly positioning itself as “America’s Patriotic Brand” in a time when national spirit and American values are being rekindled and redefined. American Rebel is an advocate for the 2nd Amendment and conveys a sense of responsibility to teach and preach good common practices of gun ownership. American Rebel products keep you concealed and safe inside and outside the home. American Rebel Safes protect your firearms and valuables from children, theft, fire and natural disasters inside the home; and American Rebel Concealed Carry Products provide quick and easy access to your firearm utilizing American Rebel’s Proprietary Protection Pocket in its backpacks and apparel outside the home. The initial company product releases embrace the “concealed carry lifestyle” with a focus on concealed carry products, apparel, personal security and defense. “There’s a growing need to know how to protect yourself, your family, your neighbors or even a room full of total strangers,” says American Rebel’s CEO, Andy Ross. “That need is in the forethought of every product we design” 
 
The “concealed carry lifestyle” refers to a set of products and a set of ideas around the emotional decision to carry a gun everywhere you go. The American Rebel brand strategy is similar to the successful Harley-Davidson Motorcycle philosophy, referenced in this quote from Richard F. Teerlink, Harley’s chairman and former chief executive, “It’s not hardware; it is a lifestyle, an emotional attachment. That’s what we have to keep marketing to.” As an American icon, Harley has come to symbolize freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of “bad boy rebellion.” American Rebel – America’s Patriotic Brand has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. Its innovative Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large and growing market segment; but it is important to note we have product opportunities beyond Concealed Carry Products and Safes.
 
We were initially incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 15, 2014 under the name CubeScape, Inc. On or about June 8, 2016, a change in control occurred with us pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement by and among us, David Estus, our then sole officer, director and majority stockholder and American Rebel, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“ARI”). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Estus, who owned 9,000,000 shares of our common stock representing 60% of our issued and outstanding common stock, sold such shares to ARI for aggregate consideration of $35,000, or approximately $0.00389 per share. In addition, certain stockholders of ARI purchased 6,000,000 shares of our common stock in a series of private transactions from nonaffiliates. Effective December 23, 2016 we changed our name to American Rebel Holdings, Inc.
 
On June 19, 2017, we entered into an Amended Stock Purchase and Reorganization Agreement with ARI and its former stockholders, whereby we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of ARI in exchange for the issuance of 17,421,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock at $0.50 per share. In addition, we cancelled the 9,000,000 shares of our common stock issued to ARI as part of the change of control transaction described above. Following the acquisition, there were approximately 23,421,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, with pre-acquisition stockholders holding 6,000,000 shares of our common stock (held by some former ARI stockholders who acquired these shares in private transactions) and former ARI stockholders holding 17,421,000 shares of our common stock directly or 74.4% of our issued and outstanding equity.
 
After giving effect to this transaction, we commenced operations through ARI as our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
American Rebel, Inc. was incorporated on December 15, 2014 in the state of Nevada and is a natural evolution of the vision of its founder and CEO Charles A. “Andy” Ross, Jr. Mr. Ross is a natural entrepreneur having successfully designed and delivered a new line of law enforcement/security products to market during his tenure as CEO of Digital Ally, a company he founded in 2004. Digital Ally successfully accessed the public market as a public company and Digital Ally continues to trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Andy also founded Ross Archery in 2006 and hosted an innovative television show called Maximum Archery that aired on the Outdoor Channel, Sportsman Channel, and the Pursuit Channel.

The roots of American Rebel trace back to a song written and recorded by Andy Ross in response to the ongoing gun rights debate. Andy was completing his second CD and the dialog on television and online was suggesting that severe restrictions were needed in the right to bear arms. Andy reached out to his collaborators and wrote the song “Cold Dead Hand.” “Cold Dead Hand” harkens back to the iconic Charlton Heston public appearance where Charlton holds a rifle high over his head and proclaims, “Out of my cold dead hand….” This phrase has been a rallying cry for gun rights supporters ever since; but never has it been incorporated into such an effective song. Andy renamed his second CD Cold Dead Hand and the song was released nationally to country music radio stations. The song received significant airplay and an accompanying video to the song received hundreds of thousands of views. In addition to the country music radio station airplay, many talk radio stations picked up the song and promoted it as a 2nd Amendment anthem. Andy continues to conduct interviews on music and talk radio stations about the song and the gun rights debate.
 
It was the song “Cold Dead Hand” that inspired Danny “the Count” Koker to reach out to Andy to create the 2nd Amendment Muscle Car for his highly-rated Counting Cars television program on the History Channel. The story behind the creation, building, and presentation of the car to Andy is captured in the episode Rocked and Loaded which originally aired February 25, 2014 and continues to re-air and has appeared as a part of “best of” compilations of the show’s episodes. The enduring popularity of the 2nd Amendment Muscle Car was evidenced by the excitement shown by 2017 NRA Convention attendees when they reviewed the car in the American Rebel booth. In fact, the car is so popular that the Company is planning several collectible die-cast models of the car.
 
“Cold Dead Hand” placed Andy Ross directly in the public and political debate over gun rights and the right to bear arms as codified in the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution. As Andy participated in the debate, he realized there was a market opportunity to provide innovative and effective designs for everyday use items that assisted the desire of customers to be concealed and safe during their normal course of everyday duties. The beginnings of American Rebel were starting to take shape and because Andy Ross’s music plays such an important part in the American Rebel story, it is helpful to trace the beginnings of Andy Ross’s music career.
 
After the airing of the Counting Cars episode that featured the building and presenting of the 2nd Amendment Muscle Car to Andy and the accompanying exposure from “Cold Dead Hand,” Andy began to imagine a product that would be perfect for everyday use while keeping the user concealed and safe. Range bags, bags and packs that were designed to carry firearms and ammo to the range, were on the market; but they weren’t versatile enough to satisfy everyday needs. These range bags were just that, range bags. Andy imagined a backpack that had designed areas to carry a laptop or tablet, a phone, sunglasses, files and important papers, chargers for electronics, anything needed in the normal course of the day, and an isolated patent-pending Protection Pocket that could effectively carry most handguns. The patent-pending Protection Pocket utilizes a sandwich method which holds the handgun in place and is accessed by a zipper on either side of the rear bottom of the backpack. If a user of one of Andy’s backpacks needed to get to their firearm, they could rest easy knowing the gun was in place and they could access it easily and quickly.
 
During the same time period Andy was beginning the design of the concealed carry backpack, Andy was writing a new opener song for his television show. He wanted the television show to expand beyond a show exclusively about archery, to be a show that could feature tactical shooting and personal safety information as well as continue to cover his passion for hunting. He wanted the show to include hunts with firearms in addition to hunts with his bow. Andy wrote and recorded “American Rebel” to be the new opener for his new show and the response to the new song and the new show was extremely positive. As the new show aired and Andy performed “American Rebel” during his musical appearances, a trusted business consultant suggested to Andy that his new company should be called American Rebel. Andy agreed that American Rebel captured the spirit of what his new company was about.
 
With the features and benefits of the American Rebel backpack identified, Andy set out to create the specific design of the American Rebel Concealed Carry Backpack. A supplier was selected and samples were created and evaluated. These samples were tested, changes were proposed and new samples created and tested. Response to the Extra-Large Double Compartment Backpack was very positive and the information gathered was incorporated into the final designs of the American Rebel Concealed Carry Backpacks. The patent-pending Protection Pocket utilizes a sandwich method which holds the handgun in place and is accessed by a zipper on either side of the rear bottom of the backpack. If a user of one of Andy’s backpacks needed to get to their firearm, they could rest easy knowing the gun was in place and they could access it easily and quickly.
 
The firearms and gun ownership market within the U.S.A continues to grow with no sign of decline. Since 2010, the market for new gun purchases has increased by 60%, and at the end of 2020, it has been estimated that there will be over 400 million guns in the US. There were 39,695,315 background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in 2020, a 40% increase from the previous annual record for background checks in 2019. And 2021 shows no sign of slowing down evidenced by the 4,317,804 background checks for the month of January, a nearly 10% increase from the previous month’s monthly record.
 
Interest in gun ownership and tactical/concealed carry clothing, backpacks and accessories is exploding. A current market leader in the tactical products category has grown its revenue from $80 million in 2007 to $200 million in 2011 to $400 million in 2015. This is a strong heartbeat for gun rights, gun ownership, tactical/concealed-carry products and enhances our opportunity to build the American Rebel brand.

The initial product offering introduced at the 2017 NRA show in Atlanta, GA includes four sizes and styles of concealed carry backpacks with a variety of available colors (25 SKUs), which include the Company’s patent-pending Protection Pocket and two styles of men’s overcoats. Products additionally released through 2018 and 2019 have included additional concealed carry jackets for men and women.
 
The addition of Nathan Findley to the American Rebel team presented an opportunity for American Rebel to launch American Rebel Safes in 2019. Nathan’s many years of experience with Liberty Safe and 9g Products are key assets for American Rebel to engineer, design, and manufacture its own line of gun safes and security products. American Rebel has the right products, marketing, and brand to capitalize on the unmet needs and opportunities identified by its CEO Andy Ross and the American Rebel Executive Team.
 
The Company will also pursue strategic alliances with other companies for goods and services that supplement or complement the internally developed products. These products may be in the personal protection category, or may be everyday products that embody the reliable, competent and confident spirit of the American Rebel brand.
 
To maintain quality, low cost of goods, and continuity of inventory American Rebel is pursuing strategic manufacturing alliances across the globe. Apparel labor costs in Mexico are almost equal to China, and offer quick response with lower transportation costs for smaller production runs. Additionally the impact of tariffs has transformed sourcing of goods and American Rebel seeks to be on the forefront of a reinvigorated United States manufacturing sector.
 
An early stage company such as American Rebel faces many risks that can impede its execution of its business plan. These risks include:
 
Undercapitalization: The Company is currently undercapitalized and intends to pursue the additional capital required to execute its business plan. Economic conditions beyond the Company’s control can change investor interest, and competitive entries could impact the probability of success.
 
Legislative and Government Intervention: The current legislative trends are favorable to the 2ndAmendment and personal protection, but a political movement, public opinion, or an unforeseen event could change the legislative’s stance, and restrict concealed-carry goods, negatively impacting sales. In addition, changes to international trade agreements and government imposed tariffs could impact prices, margins, and continuity of supply.
 
Personal Protection: The Company’s intended focus on the broader personal protection market could insulate the Company to some degree, or not. In addition, any trade agreements changes would impact most all competitors equally. 
Key Man: Andy Ross has an established public personality and is currently instrumental to the Company. American Rebel intends to establish additional “faces” of the Company that will complement Andy Ross’s contributions.
Security: As an Internet-based retailer the Company will be subject to the risks all online retailers face. The Company employs third-party services for credit card transactions, and as operations continue the Company will continually harden its online assets and deploy additional layers of protection for its customers, its assets, and its continued operations.
Product Acceptance: Fashion trends, competitive entries, and pricing can negatively impact the brand with little to no warning and with few immediate cures. Focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and test marketing suggest that the product is attractive and sellable, the brand is adaptable, and it represents a brand ego that generates self-confidence in its patrons. 
ERM: The current staffing and board participation is minimal, as such, until funding is complete there is no formal Enterprise Risk Management process in place.
 
Additional expertise and processes will be added as funding occurs and key outside board additions have been identified to add competence in governance, compliance, and audit.
American Rebel Safes
 
American Rebel Safes are a product of Nathan Findley’s years of experience engineering and designing gun safes at Liberty Safe and 9g Products combined with American Rebel style and innovation. Keeping your guns in a location only appropriate trusted members of the household can access should be one of the top priorities for every responsible gun owner. Whenever a new firearm is purchased, the owner should also look for a way to store and secure it. Storing the firearm in a gun safe will prevent it from being misused by young household members, and it will also prevent it from being stolen in a burglary or damaged in a fire or natural disaster. Gun safes may seem pricy at first glance, but once the consumer is educated on their role to protect expensive firearms and other valuables such as jewelry and important documents, the price is justified.

American Rebel produces large floor safes in a variety of sizes as well as small portable keyed safes. Additional opportunities exist for the Company to develop Wall Safes and Handgun Boxes.
 

Reasons gun owners should own a gun safe:
 
·
If you are a gun owner and you have children, many states have a law in place that you have to have your gun locked in a safe away from children. This will prevent your children from getting the gun and hurting themselves or someone else. 
 
·
Some states have a law in place that you have to keep your gun locked away when it is not in use even if you don’t have children in your home. California has a law that you have to have your gun locked away by a firearms safety device that is considered safe by the California Department of Justice (DOJ). When you buy a safe, you should see if it has approval from the California DOJ. 
 
·
Many gun owners own more guns than insurance will cover. Many insurance companies only cover $3,000 worth of guns. Are your weapons worth more? If so, you should invest in a gun safe to make sure your guns are protected from fire, water, and thieves. 
 
·
Many insurance companies will give you a discount if you own a gun safe. If you own a gun safe or you purchase one, you should see if your insurance company is one that offers a discount for this. A safe can protect your guns and possibly save you money. 
 
·
Do people know you own guns? You might not know that many burglaries are carried out by people they know. 
 
·
If a person you know breaks into your home, steals your gun, and murders someone you could be charged with a crime you didn’t commit or the victim’s family could sue you. 
 
·
Gun safes can protect your guns in the event your home goes up in flames. When buying a safe, you should see if it will protect your firearm or any other valuables from fire damage. 
 
·
You might be the type of person that has a gun in your home for protection. A gun locked in a safe can still offer you protection. There are quick access gun safes on the market. With a quick access gun safe, you can still retrieve your gun in a few seconds but when it isn’t needed it will be protected. 
 
A gun safe is the best investment a gun owner can make because the safe can protect guns from thieves, fire, water, or accidents. This year, bills or ballot measures to require safe storage have been proposed in Delaware, Washington, Oregon, Missouri and Virginia; and various laws are on the books in California and Massachusetts. Even a figure as staunchly pro-gun as Texas’s Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, called on gun-owning parents to lock up their weapons after the Santa Fe shooting. The gun safe industry is experiencing rapid growth and innovation. American Rebel CEO Andy Ross, Nathan Findley and the rest of the American Rebel team are committed to fulfilling the opportunity in the gun safe market and filling the identified void with American Rebel Gun Safes.
 
Licensing
 
Management believes the American Rebel brand name may have significant licensing value to third parties that seek the American Rebel name to brand their products to market to the American Rebel target demographic. For example, a tool manufacturer that markets a line of tools under their own brand but wants to pursue an alternative marketing plan that might have a different look and feel could license the American Rebel brand name for their line of tools and market their tools under two distinct brands. The licensee would benefit from the strong American Rebel brand with their second line of tools as they would continue to sell both the line of tools under their brand and the line of tools under the American Rebel brand. Because of the strong brand identity of the American Rebel brand, the Company would generate licensing income created primarily by the marketing done to sell Company-owned American Rebel products in the marketplace.
 
American Rebel and the National Rifle Association (NRA) have entered into an agreement for American Rebel to design and create NRA branded products. Management anticipates these NRA branded products to be available for purchase in the second half of 2021.
 
Conversely, American Rebel can also benefit as a licensee of unique products. If American Rebel determines a third party has designed, engineered, and manufactured a product that would be a strong addition to the American Rebel catalog of products, American Rebel can license that product from the third party and sell the licensed product under the American Rebel brand.

The key to successful licensing either as the licensee or licensor is a successful brand. By introducing American Rebel to the market with innovative concealed carry and gun safe products and by aggressively marketing the American Rebel brand, the Company has laid a solid foundation for future licensing income.

Description of Business
 
Company Overview
 
American Rebel is boldly positioning itself as America’s Patriotic Brand. The Company has identified the market opportunity to design, manufacture, and market innovative concealed carry products. American Rebel accesses its market uniquely through its positioning as America’s Patriotic Brand and the appeal of its products as well as through the profile and public persona of its founder and CEO Andy Ross. Andy has hosted his own television show for 12 years, has made multiple appearances over the years at trade shows, and is well-known in the archery world as the founder of Ross Archery, which was the world’s fastest growing bow company in 2007 and 2008. Andy has also released 3 CDs, done numerous radio and print interviews, and performed many concerts in front of thousands of people. Andy has the ability to present American Rebel to large numbers of potential customers through the appeal of his music and other supporting appearances. For example, his appearance on the History Channel hit show Counting Cars in February 2014 has been viewed by over 2 million people. Bringing innovative products that satisfy an existing demand to the market through exciting means is the American Rebel blueprint for success.
Market Overview
 
The Concealed Carry product market is estimated at over $1 billion in annual sales; but American Rebel’s market not only includes current consumers of concealed carry products but also includes anyone that has ever considered concealing and carrying a weapon. To many the Company’s products solve the problem of how to safely and responsibly carry a weapon. If they had our backpack, jacket or coat, they would then conceal and carry a gun.
 
The US firearms and gun ownership market continues to grow with no sign of abatement. Since 2010, the market for new gun purchases has increased by 60%, and by the end of 2020, there will be over 400 million guns in the US. There were 39,695,315 background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in 2020, a 40% increase from the previous annual record for background checks in 2019. And 2021 shows no sign of slowing down evidenced by the 4,317,804 background checks for the month of January, a nearly 10% increase from the previous month’s monthly record.
 
Interest in gun ownership and tactical/concealed carry clothing, backpacks and accessories is exploding. A current market leader in the tactical products category has grown its revenue from $80 million in 2007 to $200 million in 2011 to $400 million in 2015. This all sends a strong signal for gun rights, gun ownership, tactical/concealed carry products, and our American Rebel brand.
 
The obvious customer base for American Rebel Concealed Carry products would be any customer that conceals a handgun and any concealed carry permit holders; but we believe the market is much larger than that. Interviews of potential customers have revealed that our customer base would include any person who has thought they might one day want to conceal and carry a firearm and the availability of the American Rebel product will initiate their taking action on their desire to conceal and carry a firearm. These potential customers aren’t comfortable carrying a firearm holstered on their hip and they haven’t been introduced to a product that conceals the firearm properly, allows easy access to the firearm, and also provides everyday value for their daily routine.
 
The Rise of The 'Concealed-Carry Lifestyle'
 
The "concealed-carry lifestyle" refers to a set of products and a set of ideas around the decision to carry a gun everywhere you go.
 
The concealed-carry movement is central to the gun-rights platform of organizations like the National Rifle Association. "The idea that you should be allowed, legally and constitutionally, to carry a gun almost anywhere ... is actually sort of the heart of what the gun rights movement believes is the future." 

10



Over the last 30 years, a deep change has happened in American law and in American habit where state by state, places that once prohibited or strictly controlled the ability to carry a gun in everyday life have systematically relaxed those rules to the point that concealed carry is now legal in all 50 states.
 
General Backpack Industry Trends
 
The backpack is back. Sales of backpacks grew 9% in the past 12 months to $1.6 billion, according to data collected for Yahoo Finance by the consumer tracking service NPD Group. Sales of backpacks for use by adults (ages 18 and up) grew even more – 16% – and it was adult purchases that accounted for 69% of the overall market. In other words: the adult backpack is very hot right now.
 
The category is so popular that in 2014, backpack sales growth (up 18% that year among adult men and adult women) kept the $12 billion US bag market steady in a year when women’s handbags, the largest category, declined. In the face of the purse drop, backpacks gained popularity among women that year, and are still gaining.
 
This kind of market upswing creates new room for small, scrappy entrants. And indeed, smaller backpack players are carving out strong corners of an industry in which one giant, VF Corporation (VFC), enjoys more than 50% market share thanks to owning Timberland, The North Face, and Eastpak.
 
Fashion and function must come together to appeal to today’s always on-the-go consumer,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst, The NPD Group, Inc. “Male or female, consumers are carrying a lot of things around with them, and want a bag that looks good while also meeting their multifunctional needs.”
 
Bags worn by men accounted for $2.3 billion in sales in 2014, nearly one quarter of total industry results. Last year’s double-digit unit and dollar sales increases clearly make the men’s segment the one to watch in 2015. Men are purchasing more bags than ever before, and wearing bags of all types.
 
“The bag industry has an opportunity to continue to capture and keep the attention of male and female consumers alike by emphasizing designs that accommodate their lifestyles in both form and function,” added Cohen.

Market Strategy
 
The American Rebel brand strategy includes multiple pathways to success, all of which focus back to the Company’s core mission of providing innovative products and promoting responsible gun ownership while celebrating “The American Rebel Spirit” in all of us.
 
Superior designs, proprietary technology, and a unique marketing approach put American Rebel in a position to dominate the rapidly growing tactical/concealed carry market. American Rebel strongly supports the 2nd Amendment, and conveys a sense of responsibility to teach and preach good common practices of gun ownership. American Rebel products are designed to keep people safe, keep them aware, and give them the tools to defend and protect. “There’s a growing need to know how to protect yourself, your family, your neighbors or even a room full of total strangers,” says American Rebel’s CEO Andy Ross. “That need is in the forethought of every product we design.”
 
American Rebel directly benefits from the awareness and persona that founder Andy Ross has cultivated his entire life. His outdoorsman and adventurer status will serve the brand well as it addresses the customer through television, radio, and data-driven digital marketing initiatives. In addition, Andy has assembled a brand development team to guide the Company in its infancy. The team members are all tenured in their respective fields, and in total bring hundreds of years of experience to the brand and the Company.
 
American Rebel Concealed Carry products were designed due to the popularity of Andy Ross’s song “Cold Dead Hand” and Andy’s music continues to be an important part of American Rebel’s marketing and its connection with its customers. American Rebel utilizes social media to put its products in front of its customers and Andy’s music and television persona provide organic content to keep our social media “fans” and “followers” engaged.
 
American Rebel has applied for patent protection on several items of its products, including the patent-pending Protection Pocket. Product innovations and first-to-market status currently insulate the Company from competitor’s influence. Potential customers aren’t comfortable carrying a firearm holstered on their hip and they haven’t been introduced to a product that conceals the firearm properly, allows easy access to the firearm, and also provides everyday value for their daily routine.
 
Product and Technology
 
The American Rebel patent-pending Protection Pocket utilizes a sandwich concept to hold the firearm in place and positioned properly for quick and effective access. American Rebel Concealed Carry products are designed for everyday use while keeping you concealed and safe. In addition to the patent-pending Protection Pocket, American Rebel Concealed Carry Backpacks employ the finest materials available – Ripstop water-resistance fabric, YKK zippers and branded pull tabs, UTX branded clips. Practical design provides properly sized pockets for laptops and tablets, felt-lined pocket for sunglasses, compartments for cell phones, chargers, water bottles, and other daily needed accessories. American Rebel Concealed Carry Backpacks also contain a protected area for extra magazines and ammunition.
Future Markets
 
American Rebel Concealed Carry Backpacks are designed for everyday use and the popularity of backpacks today make the American Rebel Concealed Carry Backpack an easy choice for most prospective customers interested in a backpack for everyday use that offers added features and benefits to keep them concealed and safe. For prospective customers interested in a traditional briefcase or computer bag, American Rebel will soon have a solution. The American Rebel Constitution line of products will include jackets, backpacks, briefcases and carry bags that provide concealed carry capabilities targeting business professionals and entrepreneurs in both a business and business casual setting. The Constitution line will feature traditional business stylings in appearance while providing the innovative American Rebel features and benefits that keep the user concealed and safe. 
Intellectual Property
 
American Rebel has applied for patent protection for many of its proprietary features, including its patent-pending Protection Pocket and SmartPhone app. Company CEO Andy Ross has experience with intellectual property and values the protection and value IP can provide a company. We have and generally plan to continue to enter into non-disclosure, confidentially and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we intend to also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, suppliers and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

12



We also may from time to time rely on other intellectual property developed or acquired, including patents, technical innovations, laws of unfair competition and various other licensing agreements to provide our future growth and to build our competitive position. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent or other rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development programs are generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us or hired as consultants or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies. The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such products.
Government Regulation
 
General
 
The right to bear arms is stated as the Second Amendment to the US Constitution and the trend of current laws and regulations is to reduce the burden on citizens desiring to bear arms. In spite of years of journalistic and public attention and debate, the United States has instituted few substantive changes in firearms policy over the past century. Opponents to increased gun control diluted a brief push by the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s and resulted in two minimalist federal statutes. A second effort to limit citizen’s access to firearms in the wake of the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King produced the Gun Control Act of 1968, which largely remains the primary federal law. This modest control effort was subsequently diluted by the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986. The Clinton administration passed the Brady Act, requiring background checks on purchases from licensed firearms dealers, and a law directed at “assault weapons,” which sunset after ten years. For the past two decades, policy activity has shifted to the state legislatures and the courts, where concealed carry laws have granted more access to firearms and the Second Amendment has been recognized as an individual and fundamental right. Entrenched opposition to gun control in Congress and state legislatures, well-organized institutional opposition, and constitutional constraints have limited the risk of increased gun restrictions for the foreseeable future. It is important to note, though, that public sentiment is subject to change and voters could demand greater restrictions on access to firearms and influence Congress and state legislatures to enact tougher gun access legislation; but that is not the current mood or trend.
 
In addition to the above, the only regulations we encounter are the regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We could also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our products. It is highly unlikely but there is a remote chance that it may become the case that regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.
 
Foreign Regulation and Markets
 
The right to bear arms as stated in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution is uniquely American and American Rebel is uniquely “American,” especially considering the benefit of the concealed carry characteristics of our products. That being said, the Company has been approached by an exporter who believes because American Rebel products are uniquely “American” that they may have a receptive audience in Asia. The Company is not anticipating any revenue from foreign markets but will explore any proposals to partner with any companies specializing in foreign markets. If any substantive opportunities develop, American Rebel will address any foreign regulations that require the Company’s adherence. 
Quality Management System
 
As the Company grows, we may also need to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We have a consultant with access to our current manufacturing facilities and the Company currently enjoys an excellent relationship with our manufacturing sources. Our products are not limited to a single source and the Company has access to a vast network of potential manufacturers.
Employees
 
The Company currently utilizes consultants and individual contractors to advance its business objectives and intends to hire full-time employees to oversee day-to-day operations of the Company and with the consultants, support management, engineering, manufacturing, and administration. The Company has no unionized employees.

Based on funding ability, the Company currently plans to hire 5 to 10 additional full-time employees within the next 12 months, whose principal responsibilities will be the support of our sales, marketing, research and development, and operational activities.
 
We consider relations with our consultants and contractors to be satisfactory.
