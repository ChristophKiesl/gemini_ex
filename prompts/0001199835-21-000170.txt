ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated under the name Plae, Inc., in the State of Arizona on August 20, 1999. At the time we operated under the name Plae, Inc., no business was conducted. No books or records were maintained and no meetings were held. In essence, nothing was done after incorporation until Glenn E. Martin took possession of Plae, Inc. in January 2005. On February 18, 2005, the corporate name was changed to King Mines, Inc. and then subsequently changed to its current name, United Mines, Inc., on March 30, 2005. No shares were issued until the Company became United Mines, Inc. From 2005 until 2015, we were an exploration stage mineral exploration company that owned a number of unpatented BLM mining claims and Arizona State Land Department exploration leases.
 
On November 26, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the redomestication of our company from Arizona to Nevada (the Articles of Domestication), and approved Articles of Incorporation in Nevada, which differed from then-Articles of Incorporation in Arizona, primarily by (a) changing our name from United Mines, Inc. to WEED, Inc., (b) authorizing Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of preferred stock, with blank check rights granted to our Board of Directors, and (c) authorizing Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) shares of common stock (the Nevada Articles of Incorporation). On December 19, 2014, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock approved the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation at a Special Meeting of Shareholders. On January 16, 2015, the Articles of Domestication and the Nevada Articles of Incorporation went effective with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On February 2, 2015, our name change to WEED, Inc., and a corresponding ticker symbol change to BUDZ went effective with FINRA and was reflected on the quotation of our common stock on OTC Markets.
 
These changes were effected in order to make our corporate name and ticker symbol better align with our short-term and long-term business focus, which in the short-term is to conduct Sangres Cannabis Genomic Study over the next 5 years, process those results, and in the long-term to be an international cannabis and hemp research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brand focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade Cultivation Centers to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and worldwide organic grow operators on a contract basis, with a concentration on the legal and medical Cannabis sector. Our long-term plan is to become a True Seed-to-Sale global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development and real estate options in this new emerging market. Our long term plans may also include acquisitions of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries to make infused beverages and/or super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. We have also formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia, to address future global demand, however the entity has been essentially dormant other than building relationships and speaking at The Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia conference event in Sydney Australia, September 2019, since its inception.

Our corporate offices are located at 4920 N. Post Trail, Tucson, AZ 85750, telephone number (520) 818-8582.
 
Business Overview
 
General
 
Currently, we are either working on or planning for several different business opportunities in the cannabis space. Our first business opportunity is through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC (Sangre), where we are focused on the development and application of cannabis-derived compounds for the treatment of human disease. To that end Sangre , is working on a planned five-year Cannabis Genomic Study to complete a genetic blueprint of the Cannabis plant genus, by creating a global genomic classification of the entire plant. Second, we are under contract to purchase a golf course property located in Westfield, New York. We own the unlimited water extractions rights from Lake Erie to the property already, but need to raise at least $500,000 to acquire the property. If we are successful in acquiring the property we plan to utilize the property to access the hemp and infused beverage markets. Third, we have established WEED Australia Ltd. and The Cannabis Institute of Australia (C.I.A.) in Australia for the purpose of conducting cannabis and hemp research and potentially developing products in Australia. C.I.A. is a non-profit entity formed for the purpose of conducting cannabis and hemp research and potentially developing products in Australia for domestic research and development of products, services and educational purposes to all 7 States and territories including Tasmania. Fourth, we have an arrangement with Professor Elka Touitou to assist us with cannabis research and studies in Israel. Professor Touitou was the Head of the Innovative Dermal, Transdermal and Transmucosal Delivery Lab at the Institute of Drug Research, The School of Pharmacy, HUJ, now retired but still has HUJ clinical trial & independent studies/lab privileges. Professor Touitou is an internationally renowned authority in the field of drug delivery and design of new technologies for efficient administration of drugs and development of new products. Professor Touitou has been involved in Cannabinoid research since 1988 at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, (HUJ) Jerusalem, Israel.
 
Using annotated genomic data and newly generated phenotypic data, WEED plans to identify and isolate regions of the plant genome which are related to growth, synthesis of desired molecules, and drought and pest resistance. This complex data set would then be utilized in a breeding program to generate and establish new hybrid cultivars which exemplify the traits that are desired by the medical and patient community. This breeding program would produce new seed stocks and clones, which we plan on patenting. If successful this intellectual property should generate immense value for the Company. After developing a comprehensive understanding of the annotated genome of a variety of cannabis strains and obtaining intellectual property protection over the most promising strains, we plan to move forward either independently or with strategic partners to develop medicinal products for the treatment and therapies for a multitude of human and animal diseases.
 
Our current, short-term goals relate to the Cannabis Genomic Study and the resulting development of a variety of new cannabis strains, and, over the next 5 years, we plan to process those results in order to become an international cannabis research and product development company, with a globally-recognized brands focusing on building and purchasing labs, land and building commercial grade Cultivation Centers. WEED plans to consult, assist, manage & lease to universities, state governments, licensed dispensary owners and organic grow operators on a contract basis with a concentration on the legal and medical cannabis sector.

Our long-term plan is to become a true Seed-to-Sale global holding company providing infrastructure, financial solutions, product development, and real estate options in this new emerging market thru acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Our long term growth may also come from the acquisition of synergistic businesses, such as distilleries, to make anything from infused beverages to super oxygenated water with CBD and THC. Currently, WEED, Inc. has formed WEED Australia Ltd., registered as an unlisted public company in Australia to address this global demand. We have also formed WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., an Israeli corporation, to address future global demand, and in March 2019, WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd. was involved in the transaction with Yissum discussed herein. In 2018, we formed a non-profit company in Australia called The Cannabis Institute of Australia. To date this company has been dormant.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the original Sangres research team leader is no longer with the Company. However, we believe his departure will have little to no impact on Sangres genomic study. Although Mr. Williams was the team leader of the Sangre project, most of the work on the study was conducted under contract by Industrial Metagenomics in connection with a public university in Texas. The leadership of Industrial Metagenomics is intact and will still be conducting the study once we have secured sufficient financing. In addition, we will plan to utilize top researchers from Israel. WEEDs facilities manager is the only individual who is currently located onsite at the Sangre BioSciences compound in La Veta, Colorado. His duties also include caretaker for our 6,000 sq ft corporate Colorado headquarters and our 3 bedroom condo in Cucharas, Colorado to house personnel.
 
Cannabis Genomic Study
 
After more than 40 years of illicit, underground breeding programs, the genetic integrity of Cannabis has been significantly degraded. Our subsidiary, Sangre AT, LLC (Sangre) plans to use a gene-based breeding program to root out inferior cultivars and replace them with fully-validated and patentable cultivars which produce consistent plant products for the medicinal markets. We believe our unique gene-based breeding program will improve cultivars and introduce integrity, stability, and quality to the market in the following ways:

● | Accelerated and optimized growth rates; modern genomic resources will enhance traditional breeding methods
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Generation of new cultivars, accelerating and perfecting the art of selective breeding
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provide the ability to assay for specific genes within the crop, which is critical to strain tracking and market quality assurance
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve disease and drought resistance
--+---------------------------------------

 
We believe our gene-based breeding program will facilitate and accelerate:
 

● | Improved therapeutic properties
--+--------------------------------


● | New therapies for migraines/chronic pain, epilepsy, cancer, PTSD, chronic head injury, and others
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced opportunities for new drug discovery through collaborations with national and international medical research/treatment centers, bio-pharma companies including nutraceuticals and botanical companies
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development and protection of intellectual property on a global scale. WEED currently owns several trademarks for WEED, WEED Rules!, Panama Red and Acapulco Gold in several countries in certain limited International categories as placeholders for future growth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Research Plan
 
In order to achieve the desired results outlined above, Sangre has developed a research plan entitled the Cannabis Genomic Study. The goal of the study is to complete a global genomic classification of the Cannabis plant genus. Once the classification is complete, the research team plans to develop new cannabis strains that show the highest likelihood of being successful in the treatment of a variety of human diseases, test those strains and then work to produce those strains in a medicinal form for the treatment of disease. The research plan will be conducted using the following steps: Extraction, Purification, Sequencing. Annotation, and Cloning (micro-propagation).
 
Extraction: The extraction of genomic DNA from cannabis is a complex process of cell lysis and DNA recovery. Sangre has evaluated, updated, and validated new methods for DNA recovery.
 
Purification: Using next generation purification chemistries, the DNA is cleaned and concentrated for downstream applications.
 
Sequencing: The Cannabis DNA is sequenced using both the Illumina MiSeq and MinIon instruments.
 
Annotation: The genomic data is assembled and annotated using proprietary bioinformatic systems and the data provided to the Sangre AgroTech genetic breeders and cellular cloners.
 
Cloning: Through this process, new, high-value cannabis strains are developed.
 
The objectives of the research plan are as follows:
 
Technical Objective 1: Using two next generation sequencing platforms and proprietary bioinformatics programs, we will sequence five cultivars of Cannabis, and generate fully annotated genomic data.
 
Technical Objective 2: Using the selected cultivars, backcross and forward hybridization studies will be performed to produce a new generation of stock. The progeny of these crosses will be grown, genetically finger-printed, and introduced to the market under patent protection. Up-selection and cultivation of cultivars for quality assurance.
 
Technical Objective 3: Genotypic and phenotypic measurements of the offspring will be performed using Next Generation Sequence Analysis, Genotyping, and Phenotyping analysis. Product focus groups will evaluate new cultivars. Patent protection will be initiated for new cultivars which meet product development criteria.
 
Technical Objective 4: Utilize gene-driven breeding of up-selected cultivars to initiate the generation of designer cultivars for clinical research.
 
Technical Objective 5: Market placement of selected, genetically enhanced cultivars for the medicinal and bio-pharma markets.

Where We Are in the Research Plan
 
As noted above, phase one of our planned five year Cannabis Genomic Study includes extraction technologies. On April 20, 2017, we, in connection with Industrial Metagenomics, initiated the genomic study by extracting DNA from seven cannabis strains in Tucson, Arizona. Sangre followed the initial extraction with a second round of extractions in July 2017. So far, Industrial Megagenomics, under their agreement with Sangre have designed, tested, and developed standard operating procedures for efficient DNA isolation and sequencing of Cannabis genomes. Extensive bioinformatics analysis of repeatable and variable regions has been performed on newly generated DNA, sequencing data of 26 landrace cultivars and publicly available genomes to identify potential biomarkers to type cannabis plants without the need for whole genome sequencing. The developed biomarkers were prepared into a package for patenting, however, we are waiting for funding to perform in-vivo validation. We believe we will be able to finish phase one of the trial within 9-12 months after we have secured sufficient financing.
 
Under the next phase of our genomic study, we plan to continue our genetic studies in both the United States and Israel for phase 2, moving directly to clinical human trials with our wholly owned subsidiary, WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd. under the guidance currently of Professor Elka Touitou, who has patented Delivery systems to increase bioavailability with Hundreds of formulas she developed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem since 1988. In addition, Professor Elka has worked with World Class scientists such as Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and many top echelon scientists in Israel in Cannabis studies and Human Trials outside of the scope of Patents and Formulas with WEED Inc. In February 2019, Glenn Martin, our CEO, and WEED Israel Managing Director, Elliot Kwestel, met with Dr. Mechoulam in his office at HUJ to discuss WEED Israel goals of attaining a high THC cultivar to synthesis for controlled dosing purposes as discussed below. We are ready to begin this phase, but need additional funding in order to proceed with the planned clinical trials, as well as to continue on to future phases of the genomic study.
 
After the planned clinical trials, and assuming they are successful, then in Phase 3, we plan for WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd. to utilize our human clinical trials with continuing genetic studies in Israel, not just at University levels but to include separate studies at Israeli Hospitals and clinics across Israel from Haifa to Tel Aviv, under Contract Research Organizations (CROs) in order to begin final research & developments from strain extractions to advance manufacturing, refinement of raw product, scientifically backed, to incorporate into Protocols and Procedures, QA/QC to meet EU standards, TGA standards in Australia, and that will meet World Class standards required by the FDA in the United States. This strong pipeline and provenance will clarify and streamline licensing standards to issue all vertically integrated licenses needed in each jurisdiction that we enter in each country. We plan to utilize the highest GMP standards for eventual sale to the public, both for Domestic use and International export.
 
Under the continuation of Phase 3 and for Phase 4 – assuming our human clinical trials proved to be successful, we plan for WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd., once cleared and permitted by The Israeli Ministry of Health, to begin to move to manufacturing of product both for commercial pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical uses. These above stated studies will include development of educational courses for continuing education to medical professionals to attract; Drs. PHDs, pharmacists, pharmacist assistants and retail managers, pharmacy industry service providers, pharmacy trade press, educators, government officials, students & new graduates, other pharmaceutical & health-related industry professionals.
 
In addition, we plan for proprietary strains of cannabis genetics to be imported & incorporated into our studies upon Ministry of Health authorization or lead authorities globally for additional research and evaluation to complete DNA sequencing, Pathogen studies, Metabolic Studies, and MetaBolomics analysis adding to our databases to increase efficiencies, worldwide. Our goal is to achieve a 38% - 40% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) plant, natural or enhanced genetics, to synthesis THC and THC-A to separate THC (pyschoactive) from THC-A (non-pyschoactive) to control dosing for commercial release of products. We will conduct separate studies and evaluations for Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid. CBD does not have the same psychoactivity as THC. CBD is one of 113 currently identified cannabinoids in the Cannabaceae plant. CBD accounts for up to 40% of plant extracts.
 
This also requires the development of continuing Education Studies to educate doctors and health practitioners on proper use as stated above for increased bioavailability to achieve consistent controlled dosing for patients medical requirements and needs. This will require short and long term, continual studies to supply proper medical advice and treatment to provide the highest quality medical and legal use products for both humans and animal conditions and diseases. We will look to supply constant and continual medical information and products for preventative treatments, therapies, with ultimate goal for eventual cures utilizing the Cannabis plant and its potential for a panacea of medical relief worldwide.

New York Property – Infused Beverage Industry
 
As detailed elsewhere herein, we currently have an agreement in place that allows us the option to acquire certain improved property located in Westfield, New York from DiPaolo for a total purchase price of Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000). Under the terms of the agreement, we still owe approximately $392,000 to acquire the property. We have agreed to pay that amount in installment payments of $10,000 per month for six months beginning February 2020, with a balloon payment of approximately $332,000 due on or before August 3, 2020. We made the six $10,000 monthly payments but were not able to pay the balloon payment by the August 3, 2020 deadline, but on July 31, 2020 we worked out an additional extension with the bank. Under the terms of that agreement, we paid $10,000 in exchange for an additional extension and we owed approximately $332,000 to acquire the property. We agreed to pay that amount in installment payments of $10,000 per month for six months beginning September 2020, with a balloon payment of approximately $272,000 due on or before February 1, 2021. We made the six $10,000 monthly payments but were not able to pay the balloon payment by the February 1, 2021 deadline, but on January 18, 2021 we worked out an additional extension with the bank. Under the terms of that agreement, we agreed to pay $10,000 per month beginning February 1, 2021 until November 1, 2021, and then pay a balloon payment of approximately $172,000 due on or before December 1, 2021. These payments are in addition to the approximately $540,000 in payments we have already made. We made the $10,000 payments due on February 1, 2021 and March 1, 2021. We need to raise funds in order to make the remaining scheduled payments. In the event we make the payments we will own the property. In the event we do not make the payments, all monies we have paid are non-refundable and the bank may acquire the property. The property is approximately 43 acres and has unlimited water extraction rights from the State of New York. If we are successful in acquiring the property, we plan to use this property as our inroads to the New York hemp and infused beverage markets in the future. In order to make the payments required to acquire the property we must raise funds.
WEED Australia Ltd.
 
WEED Australia Ltd.s corporate strategy is to become a leader in cannabis and hemp research and development. To support this goal WEED Australia Ltd. has assembled a highly qualified team of well-respected Ph.D.s, scientists, researchers and business experts with the goal of establishing an export industry. WEED Australias personnel has presented at several conferences regarding the use of cannabis for medical purposes as well as for other uses. We need additional funding in order to further WEED Australias efforts to conduct research and development activities in Australia.
WEED Israel Cannabis Ltd.
 
Through our subsidiary, WEED Israel Cannabis, Ltd., we have an arrangement with Professor Elka Touitou to assist us with cannabis research and studies in Israel. Professor Touitou was the Head of the Innovative Dermal, Transdermal and Transmucosal Delivery Lab at the Institute of Drug Research, The School of Pharmacy, HUJ, now retired but still has HUJ clinical trial & independent studies/lab privileges. Professor Touitou is an internationally renowned authority in the field of drug delivery and design of new technologies for efficient administration of drugs and development of new products. As noted above with our genomic study, there is a strong possibility we do our initial clinic trials in Israel due to a variety of factors, including the fact that Dr.Touitou is located in Israel, and the fact that Israel has certain advancements in the study of cannabis that we believe would be beneficial to our clinic trial work. We need to raise additional funds in order to conduct our planned operations in Israel.

Competitive Advantages
 
Sangres research and development team works with next generation sequencing (NGS) and emerging third generation instruments and has developed the most advanced proprietary bioinformatics data systems available. Sangre uses a unique two sequencing approach. One system provides DNA reads of up to 300,000 base pair reads and an NGS system which provides highly accurate short reads. This allows the genomic data to be assembled in a scaffold construct; the long reads forming the scaffold and the short reads providing highly accurate verification and quality assurance of the genomic data. This approach, together with the bioinformatics program, facilitates a highly accurate construct of the Cannabis genome which can be annotated and facilitate gene discovery and gene location. Sangre combination of personnel, skill-sets, and data analytics capabilities will allow us to accomplish our goals in months, rather than years.
 
Using annotated genomic data and newly generated phenotypic data, we plan to identify and isolate regions of the genome which are related to growth, synthesis of desired molecules, and environmental compatibility. This complex data set will be utilized in a breeding program to generate and establish new hybrid cultivars which exemplify the traits that are desired by the medical community. This breeding program will produce new seed stocks, clones, cultivars, and intellectual property which will generate value for the business organization. Eventual expansion to Israel will allow us to include human clinical trials thru product development for its domestic and international export markets.
 
Sangre plans to develop a translational breeding program to establish a new collection of Cannabis cultivars for the USA national market. In Israel we plan to establish a unique 2nd new collection of Cannabis Cultivars exclusive to WEED for the EU marketplace. Using genetic screening technology and micro-propagation, cultivars can be up-selected for specific traits and grown to address the needs of consumers in the medicinal and drug discovery markets. The combination of next generation genomics, selective hybridization, and In Vitro cloning provide us with the tools to enhance new cultivars of patentable Cannabis.
 
Marketing
 
We have not developed a marketing plan and do not intend to until we are in the latter stages of the Cannabis Genomic Study and believe we have strains that are marketable for the treatment of disease. At that time we plan to develop a marketing plan for our newly-developed strains of Cannabis. We believe that if we are successful in developing strains of Cannabis that effectively treat human diseases then the market for our products will be a vibrant market. We will continue to look to acquire companies with revenue and companies or individuals with unique proprietary strains for future growth. We believe securing intellectual property, where possible, and branding are keys to long term financial success in the emerging global cannabis and hemp industries.
Manufacturing
 
We are not currently manufacturing any products and do not intend to do so until we are in the latter stages of the Cannabis Genomic Study and believe we have strains that are marketable for the treatment of disease such that we could begin the manufacturing of such products, either in-house or through relationships with third party companies. We do not currently have any relationships with third party companies for the manufacturing of any products.
Competition
 
The cannabis industry, taken as a whole, is an emerging industry with many new entrants, with some of them focused on research, some on medicinal cannabis and others focused on cannabis for legal, adult use, i.e. recreational use. We are currently focused solely on the research and medicinal cannabis part of the industry. Additionally, many cannabis companies are international companies due to the restrictions on the cannabis industry in the U.S.
  9

 
At this point in our development, we believe our competitors are those companies that are attempting study and sequence cannabis DNA with the goal of creating medicines from that research. We do not view ourselves in competition with those companies currently growing and/or selling cannabis for medicinal or recreational use since we are primarily a research company at this stage. However, in the future WEED looks provide both pharmaceutical grade medicinal products along with non-pharmaceutical products, such as Acapulco Gold suntan lotion as an example. We are aware of companies that supply synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis extracts to researchers for pre-clinical and clinical investigation. We are also aware of various companies that cultivate cannabis plants with a view to supplying herbal cannabis or non-pharmaceutical cannabis-based formulations to patients. These activities have not been approved by the FDA or the TGA in Australia.
 
We have never endorsed or supported the idea of distributing or legalizing crude herbal cannabis, or preparations derived from crude herbal cannabis for medical use and do not believe our research to hopefully create prescription cannabinoids are the same, and therefore competitive, with crude herbal cannabis. We believe that only a cannabinoid medication, one that is standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies, can meet the standards of regulatory authorities around the world, including those of the FDA. We believe that any cannabinoid medication must be subjected to, and satisfy, such rigorous scrutiny through proper accredited education and federal regulations.
 
As cannabis has moved through the legalization process in North America, research groups in Canada and the Unites States, along with Israel, Australia, have initiated work on understanding the Cannabis genome.
 
The methods of competition for companies in the cannabis research market segment revolve around a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, experience of the companys research team, the facilities used by the company to conduct research, the instrumentation used to sequence DNA, the companys internal research protocols, and the companys relationship with those in the scientific community.
 
Applying those competitive factors to WEED, Inc.: our research team averages over 15 years of experience (including peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations), we have dedicated over 14,000 square feet of research space to the resolution of cannabis genomics and the development of new strains, our instrumentation is designed to sequence large pieces of DNA (>25,000 bp - 10 times larger than our typical competitors), and we use custom bioinformatics (DNA sequence analysis software) not available to any other competitor in the industry. We believe these factors, along with our strong relationships in the industry and our unique validation protocols, will allow us to measure up favorably when compared to our competition.
 
Next Generation Sequencing
 
Next-generation sequencing (NGS), introduced nearly ten years ago, is the catch-all term used to describe several sequencing technologies including:
 

● | Illumina (Solexa) sequencing
--+-----------------------------


● | Roche 454 sequencing
--+---------------------


● | Ion torrent: Proton / PGM sequencing
--+-------------------------------------


● | SOLiD sequencing
--+-----------------

 
These recent sequencing technologies allow scientists to sequence DNA and RNA much more quickly and cheaply than the previously used Sanger sequencing, and as such, have greatly expanded the study of genomics and molecular biology. Numerous laboratories within the Cannabis community are currently employing this technology.
  10

 
Colorado State University – Boulder
 
To the best of our knowledge, Colorado State University – Boulder is conducting a Cannabis Genomic Research Initiative, which is currently seeking to describe the Cannabis genome. The data generated through this effort is provided through the public domain to growers in an effort to stimulate the production of new, high-value stains of Cannabis.
Anandia Labs
 
Anandia Labs is conducting work in the area of Cannabis genomics based on sequence work which was completed in 2011. The sequencing work conducted was based on next generation sequencing technology and resulted in the generation of tens-of-thousands of DNA segments that have yet to be completely and correctly reassembled. Much of the sequence data that was generated through their sequencing efforts has been placed into the public domain and shared with other laboratories. In some instances, the data has been found to be less than accurate.
Phylos Biosciences
 
Phylos Biosciences is currently using DNA-based genetic fingerprinting to establish relationships between strains and to assist in the development of phenotypic databases to accelerate traditional breeding programs. Phylos Biosciences has a primary goal of bringing clarity to the Cannabis market and promote the generation of IP held by individual growers. To the best of our knowledge, Phylos Biosciences is not engaged in whole genome sequencing and is not engaged in any genetic enhancements of the Cannabis strains. They simply supply genetic data to their customer base to more effectively drive the traditional breeding process.
New West Genetics
 
New West Genetics aims to improve and develop industrial hemp as a viable crop for the United States. New West Genetics seeks to exploit the diverse end uses of hemp and optimize the genetics of hemp to create a lucrative crop to add to the rotation of US farmers. Industrial hemps uses and potential are as great as many major crops, if not more. We believe NWG is utilizing modern sequencing technology and statistical genomics approaches to understand these factors as they apply to hemp production in states where it is legal to grow. Understanding the genotype to phenotype map will be increasingly useful for expanding production of hemp.
 
While we do not believe any of the above companies or universities are direct competitors of ours based on what we believe about their work in the industry, they could be competitors for research funding dollars. We are not aware of the financial situation of many of the above companies and universities, but we will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to fully-fund the five year genomic study and the facilities to complete the study. Most of the above companies and universities are likely better financed than we are and we will need to raise substantial funds in order to compete in the cannabis research industry.
 
Intellectual Property
 
On March 1, 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License and Assignment Agreement (the Technology Agreement) with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalam, Ltd., an entity organized in Israel (Yissum). Under the terms of the Technology Agreement, Yissum agreed to grant an exclusive license, and eventually assign, to us certain platform technologies relating to different formulations for administration and delivery of lipophilic compositions, (including cannabinoids) (collectively, the Technology) invented and/or developed by Prof. Elka Touitou at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which technologies are more fully described in the patent applications and/or patents listed in Appendix A to the Technology Agreement.
  11

 
Under the Agreement, in exchange for an exclusive license to use the Existing Technologies, we were to pay Yissum a total of USD$1,000,000 as follows: (i) $100,000 within three (3) business days of signing the Technology Agreement (which amount has been paid), (ii) $400,000 on or before May 1, 2019, and (iii) $500,000 on or before December 31, 2019 (together, the License Payments). The grant of the exclusive license and the transfer to us of the responsibility for the administration and control of patent activities and patent expenses related to the Existing Technologies was to occur after the USD$400,000 payment due May 1, 2019. However, prior to that payment, WEED terminated the agreement with Yissum. We do not currently plan to revisit our agreement with Yissum in the future. However, we do plan to continue to work with Professor Elka Touitou of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who remains our Chairperson for our Israeli Scientific Advisory Board, to implement our research and product development along with WEED Israel clinical trials.
 
Additionally, we consider certain elements of our Cannabis Genomic Study to be trade secrets and we protect it as our intellectual property. In the future, if we are successful in identifying certain Cannabis strains as promising for the treatment of diseases we will seek to patent those strains.
 
Government Regulation
 
As of the end of March 2021, 35 states and the District of Columbia allow its citizens to use medical marijuana, and 16 states have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal at the federal level. Prior administrations (namely, President Obama) effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The current administration (Biden administration) has not yet indicated how it might regulate the marijuana industry at the federal level, but to date there has been very little in terms of action. There is no guarantee that the Biden administration or future administrations will maintain the low-priority enforcement of federal laws in the marijuana industry that was adopted by the Obama administration. Any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal governments enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business and our shareholders.
 
Further, and while we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, if we conduct research with the cannabis plant or lease buildings to growers of marijuana, etc., we could be deemed to be participating in cannabis cultivation, which remains illegal under federal law, and exposes us to potential criminal liability, with the additional risk that our properties could be subject to civil forfeiture proceedings.
 
Currently, there are no approvals needed in order to sequence the cannabis genome, which is what is currently being conducted by Sangre. However, prior to doing any research into the medical applications of the cannabis plant once the study is completed, we will need to obtain medicinal cannabis and hemp research licenses from the State of Colorado and New York State. Additionally, if we ever cultivate and process cannabis plants, we will need cultivation and processing licenses from the State of Colorado and New York State which covers cannabis and hemp.

Le Veta, Colorado Properties
 
On July 26, 2017, we acquired property located in La Veta, Colorado in order for Sangre to complete its 5-Year, $15+ million Cannabis Genomic Study. The site includes a 10,000+ sq. ft. building that will house Sangres genomic research facility, a 4,000+ square foot building for plant product analytics and plant product extraction, a 3,500 sq. ft. corporate office center, and 25 RV slots with full water and electric, which we plan to convert into a series of small research pods. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $525,000 down, including 25,000 shares of our common stock, and Sangre took immediate possession of the property. Under the terms of the purchase we were obligated to pay an additional $400,000 in cash and issue an additional 75,000 shares of our common stock over the next two years in order to pay the entire purchase price. On January 12, 2018, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the $475,000 principal amount promissory note issued by us to the seller of the property, under which both parties agreed to amend the purchase and the promissory note to allow us to payoff the note in full if we paid $100,000 in cash on or before January 15, 2018 and issued the seller 125,000 shares of common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144, on before January 20, 2018. Through an escrow process, we paid the seller $100,000 in cash and issued him 125,000 shares of common stock in accordance with the Amendment No. 1, in exchange for a full release of the deed of trust that was securing the promissory note, on January 17, 2018. As a result, the $475,000 principal promissory note issued to the seller is deemed paid-in-full and fully satisfied and we own the property without encumbrances. To date we have spent $354,000 renovating the property and an additional $400,000 on extraction and analytical lab equipment. Our plans to complete the property renovations, at an estimated cost of $300,000, are currently on hold pending future financing. We will need additional extraction equipment and analytical lab equipment, totaling approximately $700,000. We will need to raise additional funds in order to complete the planned renovations and pay the purchase price for the equipment. We currently have another $1.2 million dollar property in La Veta, CO that was to house Sangre personnel, on the market to sell in order to keep our options open and to fund other operations, and we may or may not consummate a sale of the property, depending on the timing of future financing.
 
On January 3, 2018, Sangre closed on the purchase of a condominium in La Veta, Colorado. Sangre paid $140,000 in cash for the condominium which is a three story condominium, with three bedrooms and three bathrooms and is approximately 1,854 square feet. In February 2018, we closed on the purchase of property, consisting of a home in La Veta, Colorado to house company personnel and consultants for total consideration approximating $1,200,000. The home has 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $150,000 down, entered into a note payable in the amount of approximately $1,041,000. We secured a below-market interest rate of 1.81% based on the short-term nature of the term. This note was repaid on October 5, 2018. Sangre took immediate possession of the property. We acquired these properties for the purpose of housing personnel we believe are vital to the 5-year Cannabis Genomic Study. La Veta, Colorado is a small town without many rentals, so it became necessary to find more permanent housing in La Veta, Colorado for those that will be working with Sangre on the study.

New York Property
 
On October 24, 2017, we entered into an amended Purchase and Sale Agreement with Greg DiPaolos Pro Am Golf, LLC (DiPaolo), under which we agreed to purchase certain improved property located in Westfield, New York from DiPaolo for a total purchase price of Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000). Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000) deposit on October 26, 2017, with the remaining purchase price to be paid on or before the date closing date, which was originally scheduled for February 1, 2018. On February 19, 2018, we entered into a Second Addendum to the Purchase and Sale Agreement extending the closing date to May 1, 2018 in exchange for payment of $8,750. On May 1, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Addendum and a Fifth Addendum to agreement amending the Closing Date under the Agreement to August 1, 2018, in exchange for our payment of $50,000 as a non-refundable deposit to be applied against the purchase price when the property sale is completed and $10,000 for maintenance, tree removal and other grounds keeping in order to prepare the golf course for the 2018 season. The property is approximately 43 acres and has unlimited water extraction rights from the State of New York. We had planned to use this property as our inroads to the New York hemp and infused beverage markets in the future. Since the property was in foreclosure it was put up for auction, which occurred on July 1, 2019. At the auction, we were the winning bidder with a bid of $597,000. Our prior deposit payment of $120,000 was credited towards the purchase price, and the remaining $477,000, was finally due on November 30, 2019, after several extensions (which cost us total of $40,000 to obtain). We were not able to meet that deadline, but in January 2020 we worked out an additional extension with the bank. Under the terms of the new agreement, we still owe approximately $392,000 to acquire the property. We have agreed to pay that amount in installment payments of $10,000 per month for six months beginning February 2020, with a balloon payment of approximately $332,000 due on or before August 3, 2020. These payments are in addition to the approximately $420,000 in payments we had already made. We made the six $10,000 monthly payments but were not able to pay the balloon payment by the August 3, 2020 deadline, but on July 31, 2020 we worked out an additional extension with the bank. Under the terms of that agreement, we paid $10,000 in exchange for an additional extension and we owed approximately $332,000 to acquire the property. We agreed to pay that amount in installment payments of $10,000 per month for six months beginning September 2020, with a balloon payment of approximately $272,000 due on or before February 1, 2021. We made the six $10,000 monthly payments but were not able to pay the balloon payment by the February 1, 2021 deadline, but on January 18, 2021 we worked out an additional extension with the bank. Under the terms of that agreement, we agreed to pay $10,000 per month beginning February 1, 2021 until November 1, 2021, and then pay a balloon payment of approximately $172,000 due on or before December 1, 2021. These payments are in addition to the approximately $540,000 in payments we have already made. We made the $10,000 payments due on February 1, 2021 and March 1, 2021. We need to raise funds in order to make the remaining scheduled payments.

We took immediate action at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to enact rigorous safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site workforce through staggered shifts and schedules, remote working where possible, and restricting visitor access to our locations. We believe these actions helped minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce.
