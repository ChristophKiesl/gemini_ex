Item 1. BUSINESS
 COMPANY OVERVIEW
 We are a biopharmaceutical research and development company specializing in oncology. We currently are focused on the clinical development of aldoxorubicin, our modified version of the widely-used chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin combines the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin with a novel linker-molecule that binds specifically to albumin in the blood to allow for delivery of higher amounts of doxorubicin (3½ to 4 times) without several of the major dose-limiting toxicities seen with administration of doxorubicin alone. Aldoxorubicin has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the U.S.  FDA for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas (STS). ODD provides several benefits including seven years of market exclusivity after approval, certain R&D related tax credits, and protocol assistance by the FDA.  European regulators granted aldoxorubicin Orphan designation for STS which confers ten years of market exclusivity among other benefits. We are also developing new anti-cancer drug conjugates that utilize our Linker Activated Drug Release (LADRTM ) technology.
 In July 2016, we announced the initial analysis of top-line data from our on-going global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of aldoxorubicin as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory soft tissue sarcomas, or STS. The trial enrolled 433 patients at 79 sites in 15 countries, including the U.S. and Canada.
 In November 2016, we announced positive updated results from our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating aldoxorubicin compared to investigator's choice in patients with relapsed or refractory soft tissue sarcomas (STS).  The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) between aldoxorubicin and investigator's choice therapy in 246 patients with leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma, (p=0.007).  The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.88), representing a 38% reduction in the risk of tumor progression for patients receiving aldoxorubicin versus investigator's choice.  Leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma are the two most common types of STS and accounted for 57% of the patients enrolled in the trial.
 
Aldoxorubicin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS over investigator's choice in 312 patients treated in North America plus Australia (p=0.028; HR=0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.97), which represented 72% of the total trial population.  As previously reported, aldoxorubicin performed better than investigator's choice for the entire study population and narrowly missed statistical significance (p=0.12; HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.06).  All responses and PFS were determined by an independent, blinded central lab assessment of scans.
 
Based upon the updated results of the Phase 3 trial, we have been granted a Type B pre-New Drug Application, or pre-NDA, meeting with the FDA to discuss the regulatory path forward for aldoxorubicin.  Depending upon the outcome of the meeting, which is scheduled in March 2017, we intend to file an NDA with the FDA.
 
We are currently evaluating aldoxorubicin in a global Phase 2b clinical trial in second-line small cell lung cancer in which we currently expect to announce top-line data in the second quarter of 2017, as the number of deaths and/or progressions needed for data analysis have not yet been reached. We are also evaluating aldoxorubicin in a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with ifosfamide in patients with STS. We previously completed Phase 2 clinical trials of aldoxorubicin in patients with late-stage glioblastoma (brain cancer) and HIV-related Kaposi's Sarcoma, a Phase 1b trial in combination with gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic solid tumors, a Phase 1b clinical trial of aldoxorubicin in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors and a Phase 1b pharmacokinetics clinical trial of aldoxorubicin in patients with metastatic solid tumors.
 
 We also are engaged at our laboratory facility in Freiburg, Germany in preclinical development in a new class of  oncology candidates utilizing our LADRTM technology to attach ultra-high potency drugs to albumin (10-1000 times more potent than traditional chemotherapies; these drugs are attached only to antibodies as antibody-drug conjugates, ADCs) to target tumors.

OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
 Our current clinical development programs are discussed below.
 Aldoxorubicin
 Aldoxorubicin is a conjugate of the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin that binds to circulating albumin in the bloodstream and is believed to concentrate the drug at the site of tumors.  Specifically, it is comprised of (6-maleimidocaproyl) hydrazine, an acid-sensitive molecule that is conjugated to doxorubicin. In the first quarter of 2014, we initiated under a Special Protocol Assessment ("SPA") granted by the FDA a pivotal, global Phase 3 trial of aldoxorubicin as a therapy for patients with STS whose tumors have progressed following treatment with chemotherapy.
 Aldoxorubicin for the Treatment of Cancer. Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain FDA approval, has demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, due to the uptake of doxorubicin by various parts of the body, it is associated with side effects such as cumulative cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells by bone marrow), gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the mouth and digestive tract), stomatitis (inflammation of soft tissue of the mouth), and necrotizing extravasation (damage due to the leakage of intravenous drugs from the vein into the surrounding tissue).
 We believe aldoxorubicin has attributes that may improve on doxorubicin, alone, which we sometimes refer to as native doxorubicin, including the potential to increase the total doxorubicin dose, reduce certain adverse events associated with native doxorubicin, achieve increased drug concentration at tumor sites and improve efficacy.
 Our postulated mechanism of action for aldoxorubicin is as follows:
  
· | after administration, aldoxorubicin rapidly forms a covalent bond to circulating albumin through an acid-sensitive linker;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | circulating albumin preferentially accumulates in tumors, bypassing concentration in other non-tumor sites, including the heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract due to a mechanism called "Enhanced Permeability and Retention by Solid Tumors";
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | once albumin-bound aldoxorubicin is taken up by the tumor, the acidic environment within the tumor and in the cancer cells themselves causes cleavage of the acid-sensitive linker; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | free doxorubicin is then released in the tumor.
--+------------------------------------------------

Pre-clinical data. In a variety of preclinical models, aldoxorubicin was superior to doxorubicin at equitoxic doses in its ability to allow an increase in the total doxorubicin dose, its antitumor efficacy and its safety, including a reduction in cardiotoxicity. Animal studies conducted by aldoxorubicin inventor Dr. Felix Kratz demonstrated statistically significant efficacy compared to both placebo and native doxorubicin against breast, ovarian, pancreatic and small cell lung cancer models growing in immunodeficient mice.
 We have also announced additional data from a study of aldoxorubicin in immunodeficient mice transplanted with human glioblastoma cells in their brain that showed those animals treated with aldoxorubicin had a median survival rate of more than 63 days, compared with approximately 25 days for animals treated with doxorubicin or saline. The data, published in the journal Neoplasia in October 2014, also indicated evidence of drug concentration inside tumors growing in the brain, but not in normal brain tissue, and significant tumor regression in aldoxorubicin-treated animals, while doxorubicin did not appear to enter the tumor or brain to any significant degree and showed little or no efficacy in the progression of these brain tumors. Aldoxorubicin significantly reduced the number of dividing cells within the brain tumors in this trial and showed a statistically relevant increased expression of apoptosis or cell death markers.
 Clinical data. In July 2016, we announced the initial analysis of top-line data from our on-going global, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of aldoxorubicin as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory soft tissue sarcomas, or STS. The trial enrolled 433 patients at 79 sites in 15 countries including the U.S. and Canada.  Aldoxorubicin performed better than investigator's choice for the entire study population, and narrowly missed statistical significance in progression-free survival, or PFS (p=0.12; HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.06), the trial's primary endpoint.  All responses were determined by an independent, blinded central radiology lab assessment of scans. Since the initial analysis, we have continued to follow patients for overall survival (OS), a secondary endpoint of the trial.
 On November 29, 2016, we announced updated results from the Phase 3 clinical trial, which demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS between aldoxorubicin and investigator's choice therapy in 246 patients with either leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma, (p=0.007).  The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.62 (95% CI 0.44-0.88), representing a 38% reduction in the risk of tumor progression for patients receiving aldoxorubicin versus investigator's choice.  Leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma, the two most common types of STS, accounted for 57% of the patients enrolled in the overall trial.  Aldoxorubicin also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS over investigator's choice in 312 patients treated in North America plus Australia (p=0.028; HR=0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.97).
 In the entire study population, aldoxorubicin achieved a statistically significant improvement in the disease control rate, or DCR (defined as objective response rate, or ORR, plus stable disease for at least four months) of 29.4% versus 20.5% for the patients treated with investigator's choice (p=0.030).  In North American patients, the benefit was more pronounced, with aldoxorubicin-treated patients exhibiting a DCR of 32.9%, compared to 19.2% for patients treated with investigator's choice (p=0.007), an overall improvement of 71%.  ORR in North American patients also favored aldoxorubicin over investigator's choice, 8.7% versus 3.3% (p=0.058).
 Aldoxorubicin did not cause clinically significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic toxicities.  For the global trial population, the most commonly reported adverse events were neutropenia and anemia consistent with prior clinical trials with aldoxorubicin.  Grade 3 or higher adverse events were manageable with supportive care and occurred at a rate of 61% for patients receiving aldoxorubicin and 46% in patients treated with investigator's choice.  Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 4.2% of patients treated with aldoxorubicin, compared to 6.3% for patients receiving investigator's choice.  Serious adverse events, primarily febrile neutropenia that resolved and rarely led to treatment termination occurred more frequently in patients administered aldoxorubicin.  Three treatment-related deaths occurred in aldoxorubicin-treated patients, while there were no treatment-related deaths among patients receiving investigators' choice of drugs.
 Based upon the updated results of the Phase 3 trial, we requested and the FDA granted us a Type B pre-NDA meeting which will occur in the first quarter of 2017.  Subject to the outcome of this meeting, we intend to file an NDA with the FDA.
 We completed our global Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin as a first-line therapy in patients with advanced STS who are ineligible for surgery, which was initiated in December 2011. The Phase 2b clinical trial provided the first direct clinical trial comparison of aldoxorubicin and native doxorubicin, which is dose-limited due to toxicity, as a first-line therapy.
 The Phase 2b clinical trial with aldoxorubicin in patients with STS was an international trial in 31 treatment centers under the direction of Sant P. Chawla, M.D., F.R.A.C.P., Director of the Sarcoma Oncology Center in Santa Monica, California. The Phase 2b clinical trial's primary objectives were to measure the PFS, tumor response and overall survival of patients with advanced STS treated with aldoxorubicin. This clinical trial also assessed the safety of aldoxorubicin compared to doxorubicin in this patient population through a number of indicators, including the frequency and severity of adverse events.
  # 4 #
 
In our 123-subject clinical trial, subjects with advanced STS were administered either 350 mg/m2 of aldoxorubicin (83 subjects) or 75 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (40 subjects) every three weeks for up to six cycles. Subjects were followed every six weeks with CT scans to monitor tumor size. The primary endpoint was PFS as determined by a blinded radiology review performed at an independent central radiology laboratory. Secondary endpoints included overall response rates (complete and partial) and PFS at six months for each group, and overall survival.  The results from this trial were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Oncology in September 2015 (JAMA Oncology 2015 Sep 17:1-9.).
 The central radiology review, as well as the investigators' own assessments, showed an 80% to 100% improvement in PFS among patients treated with aldoxorubicin. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the investigator-assessed median PFS was 8.3 months for aldoxorubicin patients versus 4.6 months for doxorubicin patients (p=0.0006), while the blinded central radiology review indicated that median PFS for aldoxorubicin patients was 5.6 months versus 2.7 months for doxorubicin patients (p=0.0228). Per investigators, 68.1% of aldoxorubicin patients had not progressed at six months, compared with 33.0% of doxorubicin-treated patients (p=0.008). By blinded central radiology review, 45.7% of aldoxorubicin patients had not progressed at six months, compared with 22.9% of doxorubicin patients (p=0.02).
 The overall response rate as determined by the investigators was 22.9% for aldoxorubicin subjects (2.0% complete response and 21.3% partial response) versus 5.0% for doxorubicin subjects (0% complete response and 5.0% partial response). As assessed by blinded central radiology review, 25.0% of aldoxorubicin subjects had a partial response while none of the doxorubicin subjects exhibited any objective response.
 Additional analysis determined hazard ratios for the primary endpoint of PFS by both investigators at study sites and by the blinded radiology review. The hazard ratio for investigator-read scans is 0.37 (95% confidence interval, range of 0.212 to 0.643) (p=0.0004), reflecting a 63% reduction in the risk of disease progression for patients treated with aldoxorubicin; and the hazard ratio for central lab scans is 0.586 (95% confidence interval, range of 0.358 to 0.960) (p=0.034), reflecting a 41% reduction in the risk of disease progression for the aldoxorubicin-treated patients. Hazard ratios are an important measure of the reliability and uniformity of the data for PFS, and where the upper limit is less than one indicates that there is a significant difference between the two study groups.
 We also reported that a Kaplan-Meier analysis of the trial results, which analysis describes the time it takes for tumors to progress in individual patients, showed significant improvement in subjects treated with aldoxorubicin versus subjects treated with doxorubicin.
 The overall survival results from the clinical trial demonstrated a 27 percent reduction in the risk of death compared to patients treated with doxorubicin (HR 0.73: 95% confidence interval 0.44-1.20), the current standard-of-care in this indication. In addition, aldoxorubicin-treated patients demonstrated a 41% likelihood of surviving more than 2 years, a 2-fold increase, compared to a 20% probability for doxorubicin-treated patients. Median overall survival was 15.8 months (95% confidence interval 13.1-not reached) for aldoxorubicin-treated patients versus 14.3 months (95% confidence interval 8.6-20.6) for doxorubicin treated patients (p=0.21). For treatment-naive patients, representing 90% of the patients in the clinical trial, median overall survival was 15.8 months (95% confidence interval 13.0-not reached) for aldoxorubicin-treated patients versus 13.8 months (95% confidence interval 8.6-19.8) for doxorubicin treated patients (p=0.14).
 In the Phase 2b clinical trial, aldoxorubicin was found to be relatively safe and well-tolerated. Subjects treated with aldoxorubicin had an approximately two-fold increase in severe neutropenia compared with doxorubicin-treated subjects, but there was no difference in the incidence of febrile neutropenia (indicating an infection may be present) between the two groups. All adverse events in subjects treated with aldoxorubicin were consistent with the known side effects of doxorubicin, usually resolved before the administration of the next dose and did not require treatment discontinuation. There were no treatment-related deaths in the aldoxorubicin group.
 A Phase 1 study of aldoxorubicin that demonstrated safety and objective clinical responses in several tumor types was completed in 2005, presented at the March 2006 Krebskongress meeting in Berlin, Germany, and published in Clinical Cancer Research in August 2007. In this study, doses were administered every three weeks at up to six times the standard dose of doxorubicin without an increase in the types of side effects compared with those historically observed with native doxorubicin. Of 35 evaluable patients, 23 had either an objective clinical (partial) response or stable disease. Objective clinical responses were observed in patients with STS, breast and small cell lung cancers.
 We completed a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial with aldoxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors who had either relapsed or failed to respond to their prior chemotherapy and presented favorable data at the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June 2012. In that Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, clinical benefit (defined as partial response or stable disease of more than four months) was shown in ten of 13 (76.9%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory STS. The median number of cycles of aldoxorubicin administered at the maximum tolerable dose was eight. The results of this clinical trial were published in February 2015 in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer (Cancer, 2015 Feb 15; 121(4); 570-9).
  # 5 #
 
In addition, best responses for the 13 evaluable STS trial subjects included the following: five (38.5%) achieved partial response, as defined as shrinkage of target tumors of more than 30%; six (46%) showed prolonged stable disease (defined as tumor shrinkage <30% from baseline or tumor growth <20% from the nadir); eight (61.5%) had tumor shrinkage; and five of eight patients (62.5%) who demonstrated either partial responses or prolonged stable disease after treatment with aldoxorubicin had been previously treated with doxorubicin and had failed to respond. There were no observed cardiac toxicities and no drug-related patient deaths. The most common adverse event, neutropenia, also observed with doxorubicin treatment, resolved prior to the start of the next treatment. Final observed median PFS for advanced STS patients in the trial was 11.25 months, and median overall survival was 21.71 months (Publication in Cancer, 2015 Feb 15). In addition, following 8 cycles of aldoxorubicin, two patients experienced no progression of disease for 23 and 15 months, respectively, despite no further treatment.
 In connection with our Phase 1b pharmacokinetics clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics and safety of aldoxorubicin in patients with metastatic solid tumors who have either relapsed or not responded to treatment with standard therapies, we announced data demonstrating that aldoxorubicin has a distribution half-life of approximately 20 to 24 hours, with a narrow volume of distribution to healthy tissue and slow clearance from the circulation. These characteristics distinguish aldoxorubicin from doxorubicin, which has a distribution half-life of about five minutes according to its package insert.  Complete details from this Phase 1b trial were published online in the journal Investigational New Drugs in November 2014 (Publication in Invest New Drugs, 2015 Apr 15; (33(2):341-8).
 In September 2016, we completed enrollment in our global Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating aldoxorubicin compared to topotecan in subjects with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have relapsed or were refractory to prior chemotherapy. The open-label Phase 2b clinical trial enroll approximately 135 patients (1:1 randomization).  The primary endpoint is PFS and the secondary endpoints are OS, overall response rates (partial and complete) and the safety of aldoxorubicin compared to topotecan in this population.  Top-line results from this study are expected in the second quarter of 2017.
 We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin in patients with unresectable glioblastoma whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment with surgery, radiation and with the drug temozolomide. The clinical trial has enrolled its target of 28 patients and demonstrated that an albumin-binding therapy can enter the brain and have anti-tumor activity. At the 2016 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the trial results were presented including the median overall survival of 8.6 months.
 We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the preliminary efficacy of aldoxorubicin in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, a tumor usually associated with HIV infection in the U.S. The current standard-of-care for severe dermatological and systemic Kaposi's sarcoma is liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil); however, a significant proportion of patients exhibit minimal or no clinical response to this agent, and the drug's toxicity often prevents continued therapy. The Phase 2 trial was conducted at the LSU Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Results were presented at the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting showing that aldoxorubicin localized in the tumor lesions and compared to non-tumor tissues.  Eleven of 13 patients (85%) treated with low dose aldoxorubicin achieved a partial response at week four.
 We are also conducting a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with ifosfamide in patients with STS, and completed a Phase 1b trial in combination with gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic solid tumors. Since most chemotherapy agents are administered in combination with other chemotherapeutics, these studies will demonstrate the dose of aldoxorubicin that can be administered with two other chemotherapies that are commonly used to treated patients with sarcomas, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and lung cancer.
 Drug Discovery Laboratory
 Our laboratory, located in Freiburg, Germany, is conducting discovery and translational research to create drug candidates that utilize our LADR™ technologies to create high potency cytotoxic drug conjugates that bind albumin in the body, and then concentrate drug in tumors.  Led by Felix Kratz, Ph.D., Vice President of Drug Discovery and inventor of aldoxorubicin, the discovery team is working to expand our novel albumin-binding anti-cancer drug pipeline using LADR™ linkers to create unique drug conjugates.
Disposition of Molecular Chaperone Assets
 Until 2011, we owned the rights to two drug candidates, arimoclomol and iroxanadine, based on molecular chaperone regulation technology that were designed to repair or degrade mis-folded proteins associated with disease. On May 13, 2011, we sold all pre-clinical and clinical data, intellectual property rights and other assets relating to those compounds to Orphazyme ApS in exchange for a cash payment of $150,000 and the right to receive various future payments that are contingent upon the achievement of specified regulatory and business milestones, as well as royalty payments based on a specified percentage of any eventual net sales of products derived from the assets.

Innovive Acquisition Agreement
 On September 19, 2008, we completed our merger acquisition of Innovive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Innovive, and its clinical-stage cancer product candidates, including aldoxorubicin and tamibarotene. Under the merger agreement by which we acquired Innovive, we agreed to pay the former Innovive stockholders up to approximately $18.3 million of future earnout merger consideration, subject to our achievement of specified net sales under the Innovive license agreements. The earnout merger consideration, if any, will be payable in shares of our common stock, subject to specified conditions, or, at our election, in cash or by a combination of shares of our common stock and cash. Our common stock will be valued for purposes of any future earnout merger consideration based upon the trading price of our common stock at the time the earnout merger consideration is paid. The earnout will be accrued if and when earned.
Research and Development
 Expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were $35.9 million, $43.4 million and $36.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 68%, 68% and 74%, respectively, of our total expenses. For further information regarding our research and development activities, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.
Manufacturing
 We do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture clinical supplies of aldoxorubicin or any of our other product candidates, and we lack the resources and capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a commercial scale. Accordingly, we are dependent upon third-party manufactures, or potential future strategic alliance partners, to manufacture these supplies. We have manufacturing supply arrangements in place with respect to a portion of the clinical supplies needed for the clinical development programs for aldoxorubicin. In September, 2015, we entered into an agreement with a supplier to purchase doxorubicin hydrochloride both on a clinical as well as a commercial scale. However, we currently have no other supply arrangements for the commercial manufacture of aldoxorubicin or any manufacturing supply arrangements for any other potential product candidates, and we may not be able to secure needed supply arrangements on attractive terms, or at all. Our failure to secure these arrangements as needed could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our products or to commercialize them.
Commercialization and Marketing
 We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities or experience in marketing products. If aldoxorubicin is approved, we would likely look to a strategic partner to commercialize aldoxorubicin in the United States.
 We have not yet defined our commercial strategy for aldoxorubicin for markets outside the United States, which strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors or a contract sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach potential approval for aldoxorubicin.
 As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. In particular, some of our pipeline assets target potentially large solid tumor indications.  Factors such as clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of a commercial infrastructure, and manufacturing needs may influence our strategies in the U.S., the European Union, and other territories.
 Patents and Proprietary Technology
 We actively seek patent protection for our technologies, processes, uses, and ongoing improvements and consider our patents and other intellectual property to be critical to our business. We regularly evaluate the patentability of new inventions and improvements developed by us or our collaborators, and, whenever appropriate, will endeavor to file U.S. and international patent applications to protect these new inventions and improvements. We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have filed or licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the U.S. or any other country. There also is no assurance that any issued patents will be effective to prevent others from using our products or processes. It is also possible that any patents issued to us, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents, and may acquire additional patents and proprietary rights relating to compounds, products or processes that may be competitive with ours.
  In addition to patent protection, we attempt to protect our proprietary products, processes and other information by relying on trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and certain other persons who have access to such products, processes and information. Under the agreements, all inventions conceived by employees are our exclusive property, but there is no assurance that these agreements will afford significant protection against misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and confidential information.
 As of December 31, 2016, we held rights in four granted U.S. patents, 55 granted foreign patents, three pending U.S. applications, and eighteen pending foreign patent applications covering aldoxorubicin and related technologies. Our intellectual property holdings relating to aldoxorubicin and related technologies include an exclusive license from KTB Tumorforschungs GmbH, or KTB, to U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Patents and applications that cover pharmaceutical compositions of aldoxorubicin, processes for their production, and their use in treatment methods (e.g., cancer (including glioblastoma), viral diseases, autoimmune diseases, and acute or chronic inflammatory diseases) have unextended patent terms expiring between June 2020 and June 2034. Additionally, we have one pending international application covering our LADRTM technology and DK049. The unextended patent term of patents that issue covering our LADRTM technology and DK049 is June 2036.

Pursuant to the March 2014 license amendment, we agreed to make a $500,000 milestone payment upon first dosing of a patient in a first phase I clinical trial for each product using the additional technology.  In the event that by February 28, 2017, no such payment has become due, we have agreed to pay KTB $500,000, which payment can be made, in our discretion, in cash or in shares of our common stock.  If we elect to make the payment in shares of common stock, our shares will be valued at the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) over the preceding 60 trading days, to be calculated on February 28, 2017.
 In the event that we must pay a third party in order to exercise our rights to the intellectual property under the agreement, we are entitled to deduct a percentage of those payments from the royalties due KTB, up to an agreed upon cap.
 Under the agreement with KTB, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research and development activities we determine are necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market aldoxorubicin in those countries that we determine are commercially feasible. Under the agreement, KTB is to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide us with access to suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of aldoxorubicin, on the same terms and conditions as may be provided to KTB by those suppliers.
 The agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the subject patent rights. We have the right to terminate the agreement on 30 days' notice, provided we pay a cash penalty to KTB. KTB may terminate the agreement if we are in breach and the breach is not cured within a specified cure period, or if we fail to use diligent and commercial efforts to meet specified clinical milestones.

Competition
 Aldoxorubicin is a conjugate of doxorubicin, a widely used anti-cancer drug. Doxorubicin is part of the anthracycline class of chemotherapy agents. Anthracyclines, many of which, including doxorubicin are generic, have been used throughout the world to treat various cancers for several decades. Due to their track record of broad anti-cancer activity, new types of anthracyclines and modified or reformulated versions continue to be developed to overcome toxicities which limit the use of these drugs.
 
Aldoxorubicin is a chemically modified version of doxorubicin that incorporates an acid sensitive linker technology to improve concentration in the tumor. We believe that the albumin-binding ability of aldoxorubicin will allow the compound to overcome many of the side effect issues typically associated with anthracyclines. We also believe that using albumin as a targeted carrier will allow for higher dosing, greater concentration of the drug in tumors and greater efficacy.
 
STS patients are typically treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy. For patients ineligible for surgery, radiation or both, chemotherapy is the only option. First-line therapy for STS patients typically includes doxorubicin either by itself or in combination olaratumab (LartruvoTM) marketed by Eli Lilly & Co., or ifosfamide. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network also includes the use of ifosfamide, epirubicin, gemcitabine, gemcitabine with docetaxel, dacarbazine and liposomal doxorubicin. Novartis's pazopanib (Votrient®) was approved in the United States and Europe in 2012 for the treatment of certain types of advanced STS following prior chemotherapy. Trabectedin (Yondelis®) was approved in 2015 for patients with leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma that have had prior treatment with an anthracycline such as doxorubicin.  In 2016, eribulin (Halaven®) was approved for patients with liposarcoma that have had prior treatment with an anthracycline.   There are other approaches to treating STS in clinical development, including Morphotek's ontuxizumab in combination with chemotherapy, and Tracon Pharmaceuticals' TRC-105 in combination with pazopanib.
 
Patients with glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, generally undergo invasive brain surgery, although disease progression following surgery is nearly 100%. The front-line therapy for GBM following surgery is radiation in combination with temozolomide (Temodar®). Bevacizumab (Avastin®) has been approved for the treatment of GBM in patients progressing after prior therapy. Drugs in development to treat GBM include nivolumab by Bristol-Myers Squibb, DCVax by Northwest Biotherapeutics, DelMar Pharmaceuticals' VAL-083, TRC-105 from Tracon Pharmaceuticals, veliparib by AstraZeneca and buparlisib by Novartis.
 Treatment for newly diagnosed SCLC typically consists of cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide. Radiation may also be given for extensive-stage disease.  While first-line treatment can yield overall response rates of 50-80%, the duration of response is often less than 90 days.  For recurrent SCLC, topotecan (Hycamtin®) is the FDA-approved standard therapy.  SCLC patients who are sensitive to first-line treatment may receive topotecan or the generic chemotherapeutic drugs irinotecan, taxanes, gemcitabine or vinorelbine.  Drugs in development for second-line SCLC include Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab (Opdivo®) and ipilumimab (Yervoy®) and rovalpituzumab tesirine by AbbVie, Inc.
 
 Kaposi's sarcoma is generally treated with radiation, surgery and/or liposomal doxorubicin.  Liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome®, Galen US), with or without paclitaxel, is also recommended as treatment for advanced disease. Other drugs in development for Kaposi's sarcoma include selumetinib by AstraZeneca and pomalidamide by Celgene.
 
Many companies, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with financial resources, research and development staffs, and facilities that may be substantially greater than those of ours or our strategic partners or licensees, are engaged in the research and development of pharmaceutical products that could compete with our potential products. To the extent that we seek to acquire, through license or otherwise, existing or potential new products, we will be competing with numerous other companies, many of which will have substantially greater financial resources, large acquisition and research and development staffs that may give those companies a competitive advantage over us in identifying and evaluating these drug acquisition opportunities. Any products that we acquire will be competing with products marketed by companies that in many cases will have substantially greater marketing resources than we have. The industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and competitors may develop their products more rapidly and such products may be more effective than those currently under development or that may be developed in the future by our strategic partners or licensees. Competitive products for a number of the disease indications that we have targeted are currently being marketed by other parties, and additional competitive products are under development and may also include products currently under development that we are not aware of or products that may be developed in the future.

Government Regulation
 The U.S. and other developed countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products.
 To obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems at any time following initial marketing of our products.
 The first stage of the FDA approval process for a new drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the FDA. These data, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other information submitted to the FDA, in an investigational new drug application, or IND, must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. Preclinical studies generally involve FDA regulated laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product candidate.
 After the IND becomes effective, a company may commence human clinical trials. These are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing of the product candidate in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at multiple test sites. A company must submit to the FDA a clinical protocol, accompanied by the approval of the Institutional Review Boards at the institutions participating in the trial, prior to commencement of each clinical trial.
 To obtain FDA marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, in the form of a new drug application, or NDA.
 The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA.
 The FDA may, in some cases, confer upon an investigational product the status of a fast-track product. A fast-track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. The FDA can base approval of an NDA for a fast-track product on an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. If a preliminary review of clinical data suggests that a fast-track product may be effective, the FDA may initiate review of entire sections of a marketing application for a fast-track product before the sponsor completes the application.
 We anticipate that our products will be manufactured by our strategic partners, licensees or other third parties. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA's cGMP, which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Our manufacturers also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the good manufacturing practices regulations. Our manufacturers will have to continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.

The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. We also will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products, and deny or withdraw approvals.
 We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the U.S. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the U.S.
 Employees
 As of March 11, 2017, we had twenty-seven employees, six of whom were engaged in clinical development activities, thirteen of whom were engaged in preclinical research at our Freiburg, Germany laboratory, and eight of whom were involved in management and administrative operations.
