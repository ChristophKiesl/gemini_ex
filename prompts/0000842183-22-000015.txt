Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “RPT,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to RPT Realty, RPT Realty, L.P., and/or their subsidiaries, as the context may require. The content of our website and the websites of third parties noted herein is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
General
RPT Realty owns and operates a national portfolio of open-air shopping destinations principally located in top U.S. markets. The Company's shopping centers offer diverse, locally-curated consumer experiences that reflect the lifestyles of their surrounding communities and meet the modern expectations of the Company's retail partners. The Company is a fully integrated and self-administered REIT publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). The common shares of beneficial interest of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “common shares”), are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RPT”. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's property portfolio (the “aggregate portfolio”) consisted of 47 wholly-owned shopping centers, ten shopping centers owned through its grocery anchored joint venture, 38 retail properties owned through its net lease joint venture and one net lease retail property that was held for sale by the Company which together represent 14.6 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”). As of December 31, 2021, the Company's pro-rata share of the aggregate portfolio was 93.1% leased.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1002, New York, New York 10036 and its telephone number is (212) 221-1261. The Company’s website is rptrealty.com.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, RPT Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”).  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all of our properties.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 98.0% of the Operating Partnership.  The interests of the limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and the limited partners are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP Units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.
COVID-19
The Company continues to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on our business, our tenants, our vendors and our partners, and implement policies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business as well as for the safety and protection of its employees, tenants and communities.
The spread of COVID-19, including variants thereof, has caused significant market volatility and adverse impacts on the U.S. retail market, the U.S. economy, the global economy, and financial markets. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments issued recommendations and mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and “shelter-in-place” or “stay at home” orders and social distancing protocols. However, the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has assisted in allowing many restrictions to be lifted, providing a path to recovery. The overall economy continues to recover but several issues, including the changes in consumer behavior, lack of qualified employees, inflation risk, supply chain bottlenecks and COVID-19 variants have impacted the pace of the recovery. 
The Company’s predominant source of revenue is from rents and reimbursable expenses received from tenants pursuant to lease agreements. Therefore, the Company’s financial results may be adversely impacted in the event our tenants are unable to make rental payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although current rent collections during the second half of 2021 approached pre-pandemic levels, our rental income not probable of collection did remain elevated and new restrictions or a worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the ability of tenants to pay rent. Our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility allowed us to successfully manage through the initial impact of COVID-19 while protecting our cash flow and liquidity. The factors described above, as well as additional factors that the Company may not currently be aware of, could materially negatively impact the Company’s ability to collect rent and could lead to tenant bankruptcies, rejection of tenant leases in bankruptcy, difficulties in renewing or re-leasing retail space, difficulties in accessing capital, impairment of the Company’s assets and other effects that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to shareholders. See “Risk Factors” in this report.
Business Strategy
Over the past three years, the Company entered two strategic joint ventures, positioning itself to meaningfully transform the portfolio, primarily focusing on major metropolitan U.S. markets in the Northeast and Southeast regions, which are supported by strong demographics, educational attainment, tech/life science/university adjacencies, pro-business environments and job growth. As a result of our continued portfolio refinement, the Company owns a predominantly grocery anchored portfolio in the top national markets which has positioned the Company to address many of the challenges from COVID-19, while remaining opportunistic with value creation opportunities. As of December 31, 2021, the Company derived 96.1% of its annualized base rent from the top 40 national markets, such as Boston, Atlanta, Detroit and Nashville, in addition to several markets in Florida, including Tampa, Miami and Jacksonville. 
Our primary business goals are to increase operating cash flows and deliver above average relative shareholder return. Specifically, we pursue the following methods to achieve these goals:
•Capitalize on accretive acquisition opportunities of open-air shopping centers through our complimentary joint venture platforms and balance sheet. We intend to pursue growth through the strategic acquisition of attractively priced open-air shopping centers and, in certain cases, sell certain separately subdivided single tenant parcels in the shopping center to our single tenant, net lease joint venture platform, highlighting the meaningful arbitrage opportunities that we can create for our shareholders.
•Acquire high quality open-air shopping centers and single tenant, net lease retail assets in the top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (“MSA”). Our data-driven and stringent criteria for acquisition opportunities include a strong demographic profile, educational attainment, tech/life science/university adjacencies, pro-business environments, job growth, high exposure to essential tenants, tenant credit/term and an attractive risk-adjusted return.
•Disciplined capital recycling strategy. We employ a data-driven and rigorous investment management strategy by selectively selling assets with returns and value that have been maximized and redeploying the capital into leasing, redevelopment and acquisition of properties.
•Remerchandise and redevelop our assets. Our strategy is to strategically remerchandise and redevelop certain of our existing properties where we have significant pre-leasing and can improve tenant credit and term, enhance the merchandising mix or augment the consumer experience with an alternative non-retail use, while generating attractive returns, and driving meaningful value creation.
•Hands-on active asset management. We proactively manage our properties, employ data-driven targeted leasing strategies, maintain strong tenant relationships, drive rent and occupancy, focus on reducing operating expenses and property capital expenditures, and attract high quality and creditworthy tenants; all of which we believe enhances the value of our properties.
•Curate our real estate to align with the current and future shopping center landscape. We intend to leverage technology and data, optimize distribution points for brick-and-mortar and e-commerce purchases, engage in best-in-class sustainability programs and create an optimal merchandising mix to continue to attract and engage our shoppers.
•Maintain a strong, flexible and investment grade balance sheet. Our strategy is to maintain low leverage and high liquidity, proactively manage and stagger our debt maturities and retain access to diverse sources of capital to support the business in any environment.
•Retain motivated, talented and high performing employees. To facilitate the attraction, retention and promotion of a talented and diverse workforce, we provide competitive compensation, best-in-class benefits and health and wellness programs, and champion programs that build connections between our employees and the communities where they live and at the properties we own.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers. We proactively manage our properties, employ data-drive targeted leasing strategies, maintain strong tenant relationships, drive rent and occupancy, focus on reducing operating expenses and property capital expenditures, and attract high quality and creditworthy tenants; all of which we believe enhances the value of our properties.
During 2021, our properties reported the following leasing activity, which is shown at pro-rata except for number of leasing transactions and square feet:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | Prior Rent/SF (2) | Tenant Improvements/SF (3) | Leasing Commissions/SF
Renewals | 141 | | 1,015,429 | | $16.12 | $15.40 | $1.68 | $0.01
New Leases - Comparable | 32 | | 272,580 | | $16.31 | $12.31 | $85.34 | $7.94
New Leases - Non-Comparable (4) | 66 | | 374,702 | | $17.71 | N/A | $48.98 | $5.74
Total | 239 | | 1,662,711 | | $16.51 | N/A | $24.65 | $2.48

(1) Base rent represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term. 
(2) Prior rent represents minimum rent, if any, paid by the prior tenant in the final 12 months of the term. 
(3) Includes estimated tenant improvement cost, tenant allowances, and landlord costs.
(4) Non-comparable lease transactions include (i) leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months and (ii) leases signed where the previous and current lease do not have a consistent lease structure.
Investing Activities and Significant Transactions
Our investment thesis is to acquire high quality open-air shopping centers and single tenant, net lease retail assets in the top U.S. MSA’s at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our data-driven and stringent criteria for acquisition opportunities include a strong demographic profile, educational attainment, tech/life science/university adjacencies, pro-business environments, job growth, high exposure to essential tenants and tenant credit/term. We also employ a disciplined data driven capital recycling strategy by selectively selling assets with returns and value that have been maximized and redeploying the capital into leasing, remerchandising, redevelopment, and acquisition of properties.
On March 4, 2021, we formed a new core net lease retail real estate joint venture, RGMZ Venture REIT LLC (“RGMZ”), with an affiliate of GIC Private Limited (“GIC”), an affiliate of Zimmer Partners (“Zimmer”) and an affiliate of Monarch Alternative Capital LP (“Monarch”). RGMZ is to be seeded with single-tenant, net lease retail properties that have been, or will be created, by the Company upon the subdivision of certain parcels from our existing open-air shopping centers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had contributed 31 net lease retail properties of the initial agreed-upon seeded properties, that had been created by us upon the subdivision of certain parcels from our existing open-air shopping centers, valued at $120.3 million to RGMZ. Upon contribution, the Company received $108.5 million in gross cash proceeds ($104.2 million in net cash proceeds), as well as a combined $8.2 million preferred equity investment stake in the Zimmer and Monarch affiliates, in exchange for the 93.6% stake in RGMZ that was acquired by the other joint venture partners. The Company retained a 6.4% stake in RGMZ, maintains day-to-day management of the portfolio and earns management, leasing and construction fees. The Company is also responsible for sourcing future acquisitions for RGMZ. GIC, Zimmer, Monarch and the Company have committed to fund $470.0 million in RGMZ within the first three years for approved acquisitions, including the initial investment portfolio that was contributed by the Company. RGMZ will target the acquisition of over $1.2 billion of strategic assets, with 60-65% target leverage, creating a scalable, stable-growth investment platform. RGMZ has a $240.0 million secured credit facility that includes an accordion feature allowing it to increase future potential commitments up to a total capacity of $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, RGMZ had $109.5 million of unused capacity under its $240.0 million secured credit facility. RPT and certain of the other joint venture partners will have consent rights for all future acquisitions, and also have approval rights in connection with annual budgets and other specified major decisions. We cannot make significant decisions without our partner’s approval. Accordingly, we account for our interest in the joint ventures using the equity method.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we closed on five shopping center acquisitions for an aggregate amount of $202.6 million. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we closed on two shopping center dispositions for an aggregate amount of $59.5 million. Refer to Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, our R2G Venture LLC (“R2G”) joint venture closed on five shopping center acquisitions for an aggregate amount of $301.9 million. Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions by our unconsolidated joint ventures.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
The strength and flexibility of the Company's balance sheet is core to its strategy. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile is evidenced by our investment grade credit ratings of BBB- from a nationally recognized credit rating agency. Our strategy is to maintain low leverage and high liquidity, proactively manage and stagger our debt maturities and retain access to diverse sources of capital to support the business in any environment.
Debt
On June 28, 2021, we repaid $37.0 million of outstanding debt, which constituted repayment in full of the Operating Partnership's 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2021, issued pursuant to the note purchase agreement dated June 27, 2013, as amended. Accordingly, on June 28, 2021, all outstanding notes and other obligations of the Operating Partnership and guarantors under such note purchase agreement were paid and satisfied. 
On October 8, 2021, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a note purchase agreement with the various institutional investors named therein and, on December 22, 2021, closed a private placement of the Operating Partnership’s (i) $75.0 million aggregate principle amount of 3.70% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series A, due November 30, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and (ii) $55.0 million aggregate principle amount of 3.82% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series B, due November 30, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”). Such notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The 2030 Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 3.70%, and the 2031 Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 3.82%. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the Operating Partnership's (i) $41.5 million aggregate principal amount of 4.12% senior unsecured notes due 2023 for an aggregate amount of $43.6 million, which included a prepayment penalty of $2.1 million, (ii) $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.65% senior unsecured notes due 2024 for an aggregate amount of $54.3 million, which included a prepayment penalty of $4.3 million and (iii) $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.05% senior unsecured notes due 2024 for an aggregate amount of $27.0 million, which included a prepayment penalty of $2.0 million. In conjunction with these early repayments, we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.2 million.
On November 8, 2021, the Company repaid a mortgage note secured by Bridgewater Falls Shopping Center totaling $51.5 million with an interest rate of 5.70%.
During the fourth quarter 2021, our R2G joint venture closed on two new mortgages totaling $29.1 million, or $15.0 million at the Company's pro-rata share at a weighted average interest rate of 2.94%.
At December 31, 2021, we had $315.0 million available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit, subject to compliance with applicable covenants. See the subsection “Debt” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” below for additional discussion regarding the Company's outstanding financial covenants and related amendments thereto. 
Equity
In February 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, the Company's common shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100 million. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, in the Company's discretion, from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933. The Equity Distribution Agreement also provides that the Company may enter into forward contracts for shares of its common stock with forward sellers and forward purchasers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued 3,483,120 shares of its common stock, receiving $45.7 million of gross proceeds before issuance costs, which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2021, $54.3 million of common stock remained available for issuance under this Equity Distribution Agreement. The sale of such shares issuable pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement was registered with the SEC pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed in February 2020 and the accompanying base prospectus statement forming part of the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-232007) which was filed with the SEC in June 2019.
Sustainability
We continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on each of the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) areas of sustainability. We believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of supporting our primary goal to maximize value for our shareholders. The following components are the foundation of our ESG program:
•Stakeholder Engagement: We maintain regular engagement with our various key stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, tenants, communities and vendors in order to report, discuss and highlight issues of importance, including ESG topics, to each of the stakeholder groups. 
•Environmental Stewards: We are focused on becoming model environmental stewards by implementing measures that will reduce our carbon footprint and consumption of natural resources. Our environmental sustainability initiatives aim to safeguard the environment and improve the energy efficiency of our portfolio and corporate office locations, while lowering operating costs.
•Employees: We strive to create an environment for our employees that results in high levels of employee satisfaction by focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion, health and well-being programs, employee development and training at all levels and equitable and competitive pay policies. Our employees also strive to give back to the communities in which we operate through charitable giving and volunteer opportunities.
•Governance: “Executing with Integrity” is one of our core values. We believe that good corporate governance will yield long-term success and create a culture of uncompromising integrity and transparency in all levels of our Company’s governance structure, reporting, business and transactions.
In 2021, we published our inaugural Corporate Sustainability Report highlighting our 2020 initiatives, goals and achievements. More information about our corporate responsible and ESG practices can be found on the Company’s website in the Corporate Sustainability Report. The content of our website, including information relating to corporate responsibility, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Human Capital
We employed 125 full-time employees as of December 31, 2021. None of our employees are represented by a competitive bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives and our corporate purpose of Turning Commercial Ground into Common Ground. 
The Company is committed to continually building upon a culture that promotes empowerment, transparency and excellence and we strive to make the Company a safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We appreciate the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to integrating diversity and inclusion practices and initiatives into all aspects of our business, training and development. As a demonstration of our commitment to maintaining an inclusive and safe work environment, all of our employees are required to comply with and complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that governs the standard for appropriate behaviors as well as complete discrimination, harassment and retaliation prevention training.
To facilitate the attraction, retention and promotion of a talented and diverse workforce, we provide competitive compensation, best in class benefits and health and wellness programs, training and professional development programs and champion programs that build connections between our employees and the communities where they live and at the properties we own. 
Our comprehensive benefits package offers flexible and convenient health and wellness options such as health insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, parental leave and family care resources. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond we have emphasized the importance of mental wellness and have offered several virtual healthcare options. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our associates by encouraging work-life balance through RPT Remote, our flexible work initiative, and sponsoring various wellness programs and corporate challenges, whereby employees are encouraged to incorporate healthy habits into their daily routines. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes requiring our employees to work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing to work on-site and those returning to the office upon reopening. In order to promote transparency and employee engagement, we distribute employee surveys to gauge employee satisfaction on a variety of issues and hold companywide town halls. Additionally, RPT supports philanthropical initiatives and partners with organizations that are committed to improving the overall quality of life in our communities. We support various organizations annually through charitable giving and volunteerism through our “Act Locally Give Globally” program. We also provide competitive compensation packages to our employees. In addition to base salaries, these packages include annual bonuses, stock awards and participation in a 401(k) Plan.
Competition
We compete with many other entities for the acquisition of shopping centers and land suitable for new developments, including other REITs, private institutional investors and other owner-operators of shopping centers.  In particular, larger REITs may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital.  These competitors may increase the market prices we would have to pay in order to acquire properties.  If we are unable to acquire properties that meet our criteria at prices we deem reasonable, our ability to grow will be adversely affected.
Our tenants compete with alternate forms of retailing, including on-line shopping, home shopping networks and mail order catalogs.  Alternate forms of retailing may reduce the demand for space in our shopping centers. We indirectly share exposure to these same competitive factors because our ability to generate revenue may be connected to the success of our tenants.
Further, our shopping centers generally compete for tenants with similar properties located in the same neighborhood, community or region.  Although we believe we own high quality centers in desirable geographic locations, competing centers may be newer, better located or have a better tenant mix.  We also believe we compete with other centers on the basis of rental rates and management and operational expertise. In addition, new centers or retail stores may be developed, increasing the supply of retail space competing with our centers or taking retail sales from our tenants.  To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly to enable us to compete effectively. 
Governmental Regulation
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property. In addition to the discussion below regarding certain environmental matters, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances disposed, stored, released, generated, manufactured or discharged from, on, at, onto, under or in such property. Environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substance.
We are not aware of any contamination which may have been caused by us or any of our tenants that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. As part of our risk management activities, we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs, the purpose of which is to expedite and facilitate satisfactory compliance with environmental laws and regulations should contaminants need to be remediated. We also have an environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs. While we believe that we do not have any material exposure to environmental remediation costs, we cannot give assurance that changes in the law or new discoveries of contamination will not result in additional liabilities to us.
