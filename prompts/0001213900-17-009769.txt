ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
The Company, a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1987. Prior to experiencing severe financial pressures that started in the second half of 2014 and which are further described below under “—Business Arrangements”, the Company designed, assembled, tested and sold our proprietary and patented Axial Flux induction machine (“AF”) known as the AuraGen® for industrial and commercial applications and the VIPER for military applications. Our patented system when applied as a generator uses the engine of a vehicle or any other prime mover to create mechanical energy and the AuraGen converts the mechanical energy to electric power. Our patented control system is used to deliver such power to the user. When used as an electric motor, our system delivers mechanical power to drive mechanical devices. During the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company significantly reduced operations due to lack of financial resources. During the second half of fiscal 2016 the Company’s operations were completely disrupted when the Company was forced to move from its facilities in Redondo Beach, California to a smaller facility in Stanton, California. Operations during the second half of fiscal 2016 were sporadic. During fiscal 2017, the Company suspended its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations with several Note holders.
 
Traditional induction machines are Radial Flux (“RF”) machines and are the workhorse of industry due to their robustness, attractive cost, and easy control. However, they are relatively heavy and bulky. Axial flux induction machines on the other hand, have all of the advantages of the radial flux machines, but with the advantage of higher energy density resulting in smaller, lighter machines with equivalent performance. Unlike permanent magnet (“PM”) machines, induction machines do not use any permanent magnets and therefore the controller can change the magnetic (B) fields since generally the magnetic (B) field is proportionate to the voltage divided by the frequency (V/f). It is generally accepted that for PM machines, as machine size grows, the magnetic losses increase proportionately and partial load efficiency drops. On the other hand, with induction machines, as the machine size grows, magnetic losses do not necessarily grow. Induction drives could offer an advantage when high-performance is desired. The peak efficiency of an induction drive will be somewhat lower than with PM machines, but average efficiency may actually increase.
 
The history of electric motors reveals that the earliest machines were in fact axial flux machines. However, after the first radial flux machines were demonstrated in the early 1900’s, such machines were accepted as mainstream configuration. The reason for shelving the axial flux machines were multifold and can be summarized as follows: (i) strong axial magnetic attraction force between the stator and the rotor, (ii) fabrication difficulties such as cutting the slots in laminated cores, (iii) high cost involved in manufacturing the laminated stator core, (iv) difficulties in assembling the machine and maintaining a uniform air gap and (v) providing a laminated rotor that can stand the large centrifugal forces. Modern techniques show that all of the historical objections for axial flux machines can be addressed with recent developments in the design of such machines, as well as, the design of the proper manufacturing processes and tooling.
 
The issue of the strong axial magnetic attraction force between the stator and the rotor was addressed by Aura’s patented approach of using a topology of two stators and a rotor sandwiched between them. This has been disclosed in Aura’s U.S. Patent 5,734,217 (March 1998), which expires in March 2018, and U.S. Patent 6,157,175 (Dec. 2000). In addition to other benefits, the topology is such that the axial forces on the bearings are very small and negligible.
 
The issues of fabrication difficulties and the high cost involved in manufacturing of the laminated stator cores were resolved years ago by Aura Systems using a technique involving punching the slots while rolling the steel. This approach creates a continuous punched steel ribbon at a cost that is lower than the traditional punched laminates because less material is wasted. The equipment required uses a closed loop control system that controls a precision step-motor and a punching press. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered thousands of units of our induction axial flux machines in the 5-16kW range and have not encountered technical issues that would appear to affect the use of the same techniques in any other size induction axial flux machines.
 
Many manufacturers of PM axial flux machines, as well as Aura Systems with its induction axial flux machines, have resolved the issues regarding difficulties in assembling the machine and maintaining a uniform air gap. Therefore this is no longer an issue.

Aura Systems Inc. has also developed a cast rotor for the axial flux machine as described in U.S. Patents 5,734,217 and 6,157,175. This rotor does not require any laminates and provides the structural integrity to withstand very large centrifugal forces, while at the same time provides the proper electric and magnetic properties.
 
As described above, Aura Systems developed the technology and manufacturing processes to overcome the traditional objections to axial flux machines. Once Aura Systems resolved the historical issues relating to the axial flux approach as described above, the next step was to develop a smart control system that provided for a total variable speed solution. A complete power generation system based on Aura’s axial flux generator and Aura’s unique smart controller is disclosed in Aura’s U.S. Patent 6,700,214 (March 2, 2004). Finally, Aura’s U.S. Patent 6,700,802 (March 2, 2004) disclosed a method where power from multi sources can be added to handle sudden power spikes such those that occur when a compressor, motor, pump, etcetera are turned on. In addition, patent 6,700,802 provides a very unique method (bi-directional Power supply) for uninterrupted seamless transition from generator power to battery pack power and back to generator power.
 
The AuraGen® /VIPER system is composed of three primary subsystems (i) the patented axial flux design alternator, (ii) the electronic control unit (“ECU”) and (iii) mounting kit that is a mechanical interface between the alternator and the prime mover. The architecture of our patented ECU is designed to separate the power generation from the power user, thus creating a flexible system that can support multi voltages simultaneously. The system architecture is based on having a direct current (“DC”) power bus that is used to excite the alternator and also to collect energy from the alternator. The user loads are supported from the power bus and not directly from the alternator. This immediately leads to a load following design where the demand on the alternator at any moment in time is equal to the demanded user load (up to the maximum alternator power capabilities). In addition, the output power is constructed from the power bus with either a PWM based inverter for alternating current (“AC”) output, and/or, a unique patented bi direction power supply (“BDPS”) that acts as a DC to DC converter to provide different DC voltages as an output. The BDPS provides the capability of adding power to the bus from a DC source such as batteries whenever sudden spikes or demands occur. The BDPS also provides the seamless transition to maintain the power bus when the prime mover is turned off (batteries are used to support the power bus).
 
After a lengthy development period, the Company began commercializing the AuraGen® in late 1999 and early 2000. Our first commercial product was a 5,000-watt 120/240V AC machine, in 2001; we subsequently added an 8,000-watt configuration and also introduced the BDPS that allowed us to provide simultaneously an AC/DC solution. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced a system that generates up to 16,000-watts of continuous power by combining two 8,000 watts’ systems (dual system) and in fiscal 2010 introduced the TanGen system that combines two 8,000 watts systems on a single output shaft (two rotors on a single shaft). The Company is currently developing a 30,000-watt system consisting of two rotors on a single shaft (each one with 15,000 watts’ capability). As described above, the focus is on mobile power applications and thus requires an interface kit to the prime mover. Many of our applications are such that the AuraGen/VIPER is driven directly from a truck or SUV engine. The Company now has configurations available for more than 90 different engine types, including a majority of models of General Motors and Ford, some Chrysler models and numerous other engine models made by International, Isuzu, Nissan, Hino (Toyota), Mitsubishi, Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, Cummins, and Freightliner. In addition, the Company has interface kits for numerous model of military HMMWV, as well as other military vehicles. Also, starting in fiscal 2008, the AuraGen/VIPER was installed on a number of U.S. Navy boats and on a number of the U.S. Coast Guard 44 ft. patrol boats. In addition to the usage of the vehicle engine as the prime mover, the Company has also developed numerous Power-Take-Off (“PTO”) interface kits for many different vehicle platforms and is also working with a number of customers on integrating our AuraGen/VIPER power solution with stand-alone engines known as Auxiliary-Power-Unit (“APU”) to be used in emergency rescue and electric vehicle applications.
 
Since March 2017, the Company has started to reexamine the market and identified key areas upon which to initially focus as the Company plans to restart operations. A key element of our business plan is focused on all-electric transport refrigeration. The market is well understood and both social and economic forces are providing an unprecedented opportunity to gain significant market share. Our immediate focus is on 20-k BTU/hr midsize trucks and the 50-k BTU/hr trailers. The market for new20-k BTU/hr midsize trucks is for approximately 15,000 new trucks per year and a significant retrofit market of the existing over 100,000 operating systems across North America. The market for new 50-k BTU/hr trailers is approximately 40,000 new units per year and also a significant retrofit market for the over 400,000 operating systems in North America. Another key element is the acceptance of our mobile power solution in military applications around the globe. Our near-term focus is marketing efforts in the U.S., South Korea, Israel and China.

Business Arrangements
 
During the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company significantly reduced operations due to lack of financial resources. During the second half of fiscal 2016 the Company’s operations were disrupted when the Company was forced to move from its facilities in Redondo Beach, California to a smaller facility in Stanton, California. Operations during the second half of fiscal 2016 were sporadic. During fiscal 2017, the Company suspended its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations. During this time, the Company’s agreements with numerous customers, third party vendors, and organizations and entities material to the operation of the Company business were canceled, delayed or terminated. Based on informal discussions with various customers and vendors, management believes that many of the canceled or terminated agreements could be reinstated once the Company commences operating again. In March 2017, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with a Chinese company to build, service and distribute the AuraGen patented products in China. The Chinese partner owns 51% of the joint venture and the Company owns 49%. The Chinese partner contributed approximately $9.75 million for facility, equipment, and working capital of the joint venture and the Company is required to contribute $250,000. The joint venture is required to purchase the rotor and control software from the Company.
 
The AuraGen®/VIPER
 
The AuraGen® is composed of three basic subsystems. The first subsystem is the AF generator that is bolted to, and driven by, the vehicle's engine, PTO, or any other prime mover. The second subsystem is the ECU, which filters and conditions the electricity to provide clean, steady voltages for both AC and DC power, and provides for variable speed applications as well as load following for increased efficiency. The third subsystem consists of mounting brackets and supporting components for installation and integration of the generator with the vehicle engine, PTO, or the prime mover.
 
Currently the Company has power solutions for three continuous power levels, (a) 5,000 watts AC/DC, (b) 8,000 watts AC/DC and (c) 16,000 watts AC/DC.  All the AC power is pure sine wave with total harmonic distortion of less than 2.1% and is available in 120 VAC and/or 240 VAC and in some application 480 VAC.  In addition, the power generated on all models can be partitioned to provide simultaneous AC and 14 or 28 volts of DC or only DC, if required by the user.  The AuraGen power levels can be generated as the prime mover speed varies from idle to maximum rated speed. The VIPER (the military version of the AuraGen® system) includes as an option a complete power management system which (i) monitors in real time the batteries’ voltage and temperature, (ii) provides a partition of the power between AC and DC simultaneously with the ability to be programmed from all AC to all DC, (iii) monitors the RPM of the generator, (iv) monitors the temperatures of the generator and the ECU, (v) monitors the raw power generated, (vi) monitors both the AC and DC loads as to voltage and current, and (vii) provides programming of load prioritization and load shedding.
 
Mobile and Remote (not power grid connected) Power Industry
 
The mobile and remote power generation market is large and growing. There are four basic market segments (i) military, (ii) stationary but remote commercial/industrial, (iii) mobile commercial/industrial, and (iv) hybrid and electric vehicles. The military market place is also divided between mobile and stationary applications.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2007 the U.S. motor and generator industry, for larger than one horsepower applications, recorded more than $9.5 billion in sales (U.S Census Bureau Industry Statistical Sampler).

 
We believe that one of the fastest growing segments in the military market place is On-Board-Exportable-Power (OBEP), which is electric power on vehicles that can be used to support other than vehicle functions. The driver for the increased demand for on board power are numerous advance weapon systems as well as increase in C4I functions (command, control, communication, computers and information). Currently, most on board power is provided by APUs that are (i) large fuel users, (ii) bulky, (iii) heavy and (iv) require constant maintenance. Militaries all over the world are seeking more efficient integrated power solutions for their vehicles.

Similar to the military demands, the commercial and industrial markets also require on board power to support modern computers, digital sensors and instruments as well as electrical driven tools. Current automotive alternators cannot supply the existing demanded power and thus the common solution is the use of APUs. These APUs are environmentally unfriendly, substantial users of fuel, heavy, bulky and require constant maintenance and scheduled service. Vehicles used in the telecommunications, utilities, public works, construction, catering, oil and gas industries, emergency/rescue, and recreational vehicles rely heavily on mobile power for their daily work. Hybrid and electric vehicles by their nature require significant amounts of on board power to charge batteries as well as to operate electric motors.
 
The traditional available solutions for mobile and remote power users are:
 

● | Gensets (AKA APUs), Gensets are standalone power generation units that are not incorporated into a vehicle and require external fuel, either gasoline or diesel, in order to generate electricity. Gensets (i) are generally noisy and cumbersome to transport because of their weight and size, (ii) typically run at constant speed to generate 50 or 60 Hz of AC power, (iii) must be operated at a significant part of the rated power to avoid wet staking, (iv) are significantly derated in the presence of harmonics in the loads and (v) require significant scheduled maintenance and service. Genset technology has been utilized since the 1950s.

● | High-Output Alternators, High-output alternators are traditionally found in trucks and commercial vehicles and the vehicle’s engine is used as the prime mover. All high-output alternators provide their rated power at very high RPM and significantly less power at lower RPM. In addition, high-output alternators are generally only 30% efficient at the low RPM range and increase to 50% efficiency at the high end of the RPM range. The power generated by high-output alternators is 12 or 24 Volt DC and an inverter is required if AC power is needed. In addition, due to the low power output at low RPMs, in order to get significant power, a throttle controller is used to speed-up the engine.

● | Inverters, Inverters are devices that invert DC to AC. Inverters as mobile power generators are traditionally used in low power requirements, typically less than 2,500 watts, and do not have the ability to recharge the batteries that are traditionally used as the source of power. Thus, typical inverter users require other means to recharge the used batteries such as “shore-power” or gensets. More recently dynamic inverters became available. Dynamic inverters use power from the alternator to augment power from the batteries and are able to achieve power levels in excess of 6,000 watts. Dynamic inverters introduce significant stresses on both the batteries and alternators, which causes significant life shortening for both. When the inverter is turned on, the alternator is switched off from the vehicle battery and tied into a transformer that uses electronic controls to change the DC alternator inputs to AC inverter output. A separate transformer winding provides battery charging so that fully regulated 120 Volt AC and 12 Volt DC power is available as long as the engine is running at high enough RPM to provide power for the load and the battery charging. All dynamic inverters require a high-output alternator to be able to output significant AC power. As is often the case, the limiting factor is the high-output alternator. In order to get stable output, a very accurate throttle controller is also needed to maintain steady speed on the engine.

● | Permanent-Magnet Alternators. Recently a number of companies have introduced alternators using exotic permanent magnets. These alternators tend to have higher power generation capabilities than regular alternators at lower engine RPM. In order to be practical in an under-the–hood environment (200oF) active cooling must be added, since the magnets are demagnetized at approximately 176oF. There are other issues that require an active control system that will add and subtract magnetic field strength as the engine RPM increases. Currently, the vast majority of the magnets used for electric machines come from China.

● | Fuel Cells. Fuel cells are solid-state devices that produce electricity by combining a fuel containing hydrogen with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications and can be used in place of the internal combustion engine and traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. The most widely deployed fuel cells cost about $2,000 per kilowatt.

Competition
 
The Company is involved in the application of its AuraGen technology to mobile power and, as such, faces substantial competition from companies offering different technologies. Over the last several years there have not been new significant developments in this industry.
 
Gensets AKA APU - Portable generators meet a large market need for auxiliary power. Millions of units per year are sold in North America alone, and millions more across the world to meet market demands for 1 to 20 Kilowatts of portable power. The market for these power levels addresses the commercial, leisure and residential markets, and divides essentially into: a) higher power, higher quality and higher price commercial level units; and b) lower power, lower quality and lower price level units. Gensets provide the strongest competition across the widest marketplace for auxiliary power. Onan, Honda and Kohler, among others, are well established and respected brand names in the genset market for auxiliary power generation. There are 44 registered genset-manufacturing companies in the U.S. with many more through Asia and, particularly, within China.
 
High Output Alternators - There are many high output alternator manufacturers and the prices vary from hundreds to thousands of dollars per unit. Some well-known manufacturers include: Delco-Remy, Bosh, Nippon Densu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Prestolite, EMP and Neihoff. Alternators provide rated power at very high RPM and significantly less power at lower RPM. In addition, alternators are generally only 30% efficient at the low RPM range and increase to 50% efficiency at the high RPM range. The AuraGen/VIPER system (including mechanical linkages and belt) is over 80% efficient at the low RPM range and is approximately 75% efficient at the very high RPM range.
 
Inverters - There are many inverter manufacturers; across the globe the best known one is Xentrex. The pricing of industrial grade sine wave inverters is approximately $500 per kilowatt plus the cost of a high output alternator ($650) and a good throttle controller ($250).
 
Permanent-Magnet (“PM”) alternators. - A number of companies have introduced alternators using exotic NdFeB magnets (UQM technologies is one of the better known). These alternators tend to have higher power generation capabilities than regular alternators at lower RPM. Unfortunately, PM machines with NdFeB magnets are very sensitive to temperature and, unlike the AuraGen, cannot survive the typical under-the-hood environment (200oF+). In order to apply such devices for automotive applications one must add expensive and cumbersome active cooling since the magnets are demagnetized at approximately (176oF). To date, such machines have been used mostly in wind-power generation applications.
 
In addition to the temperature challenges of such machines, there are other issues involving active control of the magnetic field. A disadvantage of PM generators is the difficulty of output voltage regulation to compensate for speed and load variation due to the lack of a simple means of field control. In addition, in PM alternators as the machine size grows, the magnetic loses increase proportionally. Finally, PM machines are more expensive than induction machines.
 
Fuel Cells - Fuel cells are solid-state, devices that produce electricity by combining a fuel containing hydrogen with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications, and can be used in place of the internal combustion engine and traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. These systems are, however, generally prohibitively expensive, and the most widely deployed fuel cells cost about $1,500 per kilowatt.
 
Others - Symetron Technology by Raser Inc. is sometimes mistaken for a new form of motor or generator. The Symetron technology is a variable frequency motor/generator controller that uses numerous control schemes to optimize performance. The Symetron technology involves adaptive tuning to continuously optimize motor and system efficiency for the speed and torque operating point. When the system was tested in November 2006 the adaptive algorithm or table calculations were performed offline and then input to the controller.
 
The Symetron controller is a potential competitor to variable speed motor controllers provided by such companies as of ABB, or Baldor-Electric Co. The Symetron technology is not a new form of motor/generator.
 

There are a number of companies that advertise a “secret” approach for higher performance of inductive machines. Typically, these claims are not proven and are based on changing the winding connections from Y to D or D to Y.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Axco in Finland briefly introduced axial flux machines similar to Aura’s. However, Axco stopped its pursue of patent protection in the U.S. when they discovered Aura’s patents. Furthermore, one of Axco scientist cites Aura’s approach in his PhD dissertation. Axco business is currently focused on large permanent magnets applications mostly related to large windmills.

Evans electric in Australia has recently introduced an axial flux machine with a complete conductive rotor. Such a machine was first introduced by Brinner more than 20 years ago and was abandoned because the rotor lacked the required rigidity to withstand the magnetic and centrifugal forces. The Brinner machine is cited in Aura’s patents.
 
Transport Refrigeration (“TRU”) - The main competitors for the all-electric TRU are traditional diesel based solutions provided by Thermo-king and Carrier. The diesel based comparable systems provided by Thermo-king and Carrier are somewhat less expensive than our AuraGen all-electric solution, however the diesel solutions require frequent maintenance and the utilization of a separate diesel engine that consumes considerable fuel every operating hour. In addition, the diesel solutions emit harmful emissions that have been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California’s Air Resource Board and others as dangerous pollutants and are increasingly subject to federal and state regulations.
 
The economic and environmental benefits of the AuraGen solution are greatly amplified in transport refrigeration applications where a separate diesel engine is eliminated. An analysis of our solution for large refrigeration trucks (117,000 trucks across the nation) shows potential annual savings in excess of 26,000 tons of NMHC+NOx, 23,000 tons of CO and over to 1,400 tons of PM. The diesel fuel savings exceed 100,000,000 annual gallons. The above numbers are very conservative since they reflect: (i) the assumption that all refrigeration diesel engines already meet the Tier 4 EPA requirements and (ii) that there are no additional savings from idle reductions. Both assumptions are used as a lower bound for the anticipated savings.
 
Most of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we have. They have larger budgets for research, new product development and marketing, and have long-standing customer relationships. We also compete with many larger and more established companies in the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. Our financial condition has limited our ability to market the AuraGen® aggressively.
 
The AuraGen® uses new technology and because our product is radically different from traditionally available mobile power solutions, users may require lengthy evaluation periods to gain confidence in the product. OEMs and large fleet users also typically require considerable time to make changes to their planning and production.
 
Targeted Markets
 
It is only recently that the Company has started to reexamine and identify key markets upon which to initially focus as the Company plans to restart operations.
 
(i) A key element of our business plan is focused on All-Electric Transport refrigeration. The market is well understood and both social and economic forces are providing an unprecedented opportunity to gain significant market share. Our immediate focus is on 20-k BTU/hr midsize trucks and the 50-k BTU/hr trailers.
 
(ii) Another element of our business plan is focused of our mobile power solution for military applications around the globe.
 
(iii) We plan to look for joint venture opportunities similar to the agreement we recently entered in China to explore other international opportunities.
 
Facilities, Manufacturing Process and Suppliers
 
As part of downsizing due to financial distress experienced by the Company as further described in “--Business Arrangements”, our current facilities consist of approximately 20,000 square feet in Stanton California and an additional storage facility for existing inventory. The Stanton facility is currently used for some assembly and testing of AuraGen/VIPER systems. The facility is rented on a month-to-month basis. The rent for the Stanton facility is $10,000 per month and the storage facility is additional $5,000 per month. The current Stanton facility is not sufficient to support the expected operations should the Company’s operations return to pre-2014 production levels. Accordingly, the Company is currently looking for a new facility of approximately 45,000 square feet that would be used for production, testing, and engineering for AuraGen/VIPER mobile power solution as well as needed office space for support staff. Prior to May 2015, we occupied a 69,000 square foot facility in Redondo Beach, California. The Redondo Beach facility was used for assembly and testing of products, as well as for general offices, engineering and warehousing. The rent for the Redondo Beach facility was approximately $60,000 per month.

As the Company is gearing up operations again, we need to renew relationships and contracts with our suppliers or locate suitable new suppliers for subassemblies and other components. Recently, the Company entered into discussions with several of its prior suppliers and is in the process of negotiating settlements of old payables and arranging new supply contracts. 
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that ongoing research and development is important to the success of our product in order to utilize the most recent technology, to develop additional products and additional uses for existing products, to stay current with changes in vehicle manufacture and design and to maintain an ongoing advantage over potential competition. Our engineering, research and development costs for fiscal 2015 were approximately $0.8 million compared to approximately $1.3 million in fiscal 2014. 
 
We stopped practically all research and development in the last two years due to severe cash shortfall, however we did redesign all the Electronic Control Unit (“ECU”) to the latest state of the art in power electronics and processors. It is expected that once the Company restarts operations, we will initially set a modest budget of $400,000 for research and development during the first year after restart. We believe that ongoing research and development is important to the success of our product in order to utilize the most recent technology, to develop additional products and additional uses for existing products, to stay current with changes in vehicle manufacture and design and to maintain an ongoing advantage over potential competitors. 
 
Patents and Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of trademarks, proprietary know-how and patents.
 
In the area of electromagnetic technology, we have developed numerous magnetic systems and designs that result in a significant increase of magnetic field density per unit volume that can be converted into useful power energy or work. This increase in field density is a factor of three to four, which, when incorporated into mechanical devices, could result in a significant reduction in size and cost of production for the same performance.
 
The applications of these technological advances are in machines used every day by industrial, commercial, and consumers. We have applied technology to numerous applications in industrial machines, such as generators, motors, actuators, and linear motors.
 
We hold the following patents: Nos. 5,734,217; 6,157,175; 6,700,214; 6,700,802; with expiration dates in 2018, 2020, 2024 and 2024 respectively. A provisional patent for a water-cooled AuraGen was granted in March 2013. Application 61/516,071 was filed January 2012 and claims allowed in March 2015, with an expiration date of March 2032.
 
The following applications are pending: Application 13/849,464 filed in March 2013; and Application 13/781,749 filed in March 2013.
 
Induction Machine
 
The basic patent covers a new form of induction machine with superior performance in a much smaller size than conventional machines. The solid cast rotor, the shaped magnetic field, the secondary conduction path through the steel and the axial magnetic orientations are key components of this innovation.
Control System
 
This system separates the power generation from the power delivery by introducing a 400 VDC buss. For each cycle of each phase, part of the cycle power is drawn from the bus to run the electronics and energize the coils, while during the other part of the cycle, power is delivered to charge up the buss. The control system must balance all the timing to effect zero voltage change to the buss under dynamic variations of frequency and loads. The ability to optimize in real time the slip frequency is a key innovation in motor and generator control for variable speed, variable frequency, and variable load systems.

Bi-Directional Power Supply (“BDP”)
 
The patented ICS system developed by Aura provides a new capability in power systems. The BDP allows a system to use multiple sources of power simultaneously. It is a key component in providing the ability to deliver both AC and DC power simultaneously, as well as the ability to handle large power surges without the need for a throttle controller.
 
At the end of fiscal 2013 and the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we filed five new patent applications related to the AuraGen. These new patent applications are specifically designed to cover the (i) integration of the AuraGen power solution with transport refrigeration, (ii) the interface kit of the AuraGen with prime movers, (iii) a water cooled AuraGen solution for situations where ventilation is not available, (iv) a unique cable system with safety protection to transfer high power between two moving objects, and (v) a unique clamping of power electronic components to heat sink to ensure good thermal conductivity.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect the Company’s activities, which include, but are not limited to, the areas of labor, intellectual property and ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, environmental, and health and safety. As we recommence operations, our operations will again be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expect to expend resources to maintain compliance with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, other than our CEO Mr. Gagerman, the Company has no employees. However there are four independent contractors two of which are working to support the outside independent auditor, one who is working on redesigning the Electronic Control Unit for the AuraGen/VIPER and one who is helping dealing with the JV Agreement, and other technical matters. The independent contractors are used on an as need basis.
Significant Customers
 
During the year ended February 28, 2015, we conducted business with two major customers whose sales comprised 31.6%, and 16.4% of net sales, respectively. As of February 28, 2014, these customers accounted for 39.5% of net accounts receivable. During the year ended February 28, 2014, we conducted business with five major customers whose sales comprised 27.1%, 25.8%, 8.9%, 7.8% and 5.4% of net sales, respectively. As of February 28, 2014, these customers accounted for 97.7% of net accounts receivable.
Backlog
 
There are no significant customers as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the Company has an initial order of AuraGen systems and components representing approximately $1.25 million and deliverable during fiscal 2018 to a joint venture partner to support their marketing efforts as the joint venture facilities are being readied. Management believes that once the Company is operating again, a significant backlog will develop. No assurances, however, can be given how long it will take the Company, if at all, to develop a significant backlog. For additional information, see “Certain Subsequent Events—China Joint Venture.”
Raw Materials
 
The most important raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are steel, copper, and aluminum. Raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We have no significant long-term supply contracts. When possible, we maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, which we believe contribute to our ability to obtain competitive pricing. The cost of some of our raw materials and shipping costs are dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins. 
 
We enter into standard purchase agreements with certain foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf.

Certain Subsequent Events
 
Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2017, certain material developments have occurred relating to the business of the Company.
 
China Joint Venture - On January 27, 2017, we entered into a Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Jiangsu AoLunTe Electrical Machinery Industrial Co., Ltd. (“AoLunTe”) pursuant to which the parties will establish a joint venture company (the “JV”) for the purposes of manufacturing and distributing our patented mobile power solution in the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC”). The business of the JV is limited to the manufacturing, marketing and sale, repair and maintenance of selected mobile power products for commercial and military use in the PRC only.
 
Pursuant to the JV Agreement, AoLunTe will own 51% of the JV and we will own 49%, and profits will be distributed based on the ownership interest of each party. AoLunTe will contribute the RMB equivalent of $500,000 US dollars in cash within 30 days after the Establishment Date (as defined), as well as tangible and intangible assets (including but not limited to equipment, land and facilities of the site for the JV) not later than 180 days after the Establishment Date valued at 9.25 million in US Dollars. The “Establishment Date” is the first business day after the JV’s receipt of the certificate of approval issued by the PRC governmental authority responsible for approving the JV Agreement and the Articles of Association of the JV. Such approval was granted in March 2017. Pursuant to the JV Agreement, we are required to contribute the RMB equivalent of $250,000 in US dollars within 45 days after the Establishment Date, as well as an exclusive, non-assignable, and royalty-free license in the PRC to use our intellectual property. We have made the required payment.
 
The JV shall be governed by a Board of Directors, consisting of three directors nominated by AoLunTe and three directors nominated by us. All “Major Decisions” of the Board, which are specified in a schedule to the JV Agreement, require the vote of two-thirds of the directors, including at least one director nominated by us and one director nominated by AoLunTe. All other decisions of the Board require the approval of a simple majority of directors. A general manager appointed by the Board upon the nomination by AoLunTe shall be responsible for the day-to-day operation and management of the JV, while quality control as well as the financial controller are to be managed by individuals to be appointed by the Board upon our nomination, under the supervision of the Board.
 
The term of the JV Agreement is 30 years from the Establishment Date, subject to extension by mutual written agreement of the parties. The JV Agreement may be terminated sooner by the written agreement of the parties or in the event of certain specified events, including without limitation a material breach of the JV Agreement which is not remedied (if capable of remedy) within 30 days after written notice of such breach is provided to the other party.
 
Pursuant to the JV Agreement, AoLunTe will purchase from us $1,250,000 of product, payable in four payments after the Establishment Date in the amounts of $500,000, $250,000, $250,000, and $250,000. The fourth payment will be offset against a prior advance for products paid by AoLunTe to us.
 
AoLunTe is required by the JV Agreement to purchase 10 million shares of our Common Stock (such number being prior to a contemplated 1-for-7 reverse stock split by us, the “Reverse Split”) for an aggregate of $2,000,000 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, the form of which is attached to the JV Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the first installment of $1,000,000 was paid into a mutually-agreed escrow account and subsequently released from escrow in March 2017. The second installment of $1,000,000 was also paid into a mutually-agreed escrow account and is scheduled to be released to us following approval by our stockholders of resolutions electing a new board of directors and approving an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the above-referenced 1-for-7 reverse stock split of our Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock to be sold to AoLunTe are being sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will not be offered or sold to any U.S. person or for the account or benefit of any U.S. person prior to the end of the restricted period provided by Regulation S and any other applicable law.
