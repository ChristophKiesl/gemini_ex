ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Unisys Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Unisys," "we," "our," the "Company"), is a global information technology (“IT”) company that specializes in providing industry-focused solutions integrated with leading-edge security to clients in the government, commercial and financial services markets. Our offerings include security solutions, advanced data analytics, cloud and infrastructure services, application services and application and server software. 
We operate in two business segments – Services and Technology. Financial information concerning the two segments can be found in Note 15, “Segment information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) (the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").
Principal Products and Services
We market and deliver industry-specific solutions, horizontal services and technology products (software and hardware) worldwide to our primary target markets: government (comprising the U.S. federal government and other public sector organizations), commercial (focusing on travel and transportation and life sciences/healthcare) and financial services (including commercial and retail banking). 
Our solutions are designed to enable clients to:

• | Transform core business processes to compete more effectively in their market sector;


• | Improve user engagement for customers and workers, streamline operations and enhance go-to-market efforts;


• | Optimize IT infrastructure to meet digital-business requirements;


• | Simplify management of IT infrastructure and service delivery; and


• | Utilize advanced security capabilities.

Our industry-specific solutions enable clients to address key challenges in their market sectors — for example, we offer solutions for criminal investigation management and border security in government, travel and transportation and life sciences and healthcare in commercial markets, and commercial and retail banking in financial services.
Our principal services include cloud and infrastructure services, application services, and business process outsourcing services. 

• | In cloud and infrastructure services, we help clients apply cloud and as-a-service delivery models to capitalize on business opportunities, make their end users more productive, and manage and secure their IT infrastructure and operations more economically.


• | In application services, we help clients transform their business processes by providing advanced solutions for select industries, developing and managing new leading-edge applications, offering advanced data analytics and modernizing existing enterprise applications.


• | In business process outsourcing services, we assume management of critical processes and functions for clients in target industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs.

In technology, we design and develop software, servers and related products to help clients reduce costs, improve security and flexibility, and improve the efficiency of their data center environments. As a pioneer in large-scale computing, we offer deep experience and rich technological capabilities in transaction-intensive, mission-critical environments. We provide a range of data center, infrastructure management and cloud computing offerings to help clients virtualize and automate their data-center environments. Technology offerings include ClearPath Forward™ software operating system, the Unisys Stealth® family of security software, industry-focused software such as Digital Investigator™, middleware and servers.
The following are some of our most prominent products:

• | Unisys ClearPath Forward™ is a secure, scalable, hardware-independent software environment for high-volume enterprise computing. ClearPath Forward is available as an integrated operating environment or reference architecture to deliver Unisys security across multiple hardware platforms. In 2016 Unisys began offering hardware-independent versions of the ClearPath operating environment, providing a tested, integrated stack of software products that can run on an Intel x86 server of the client’s choice.

• | Unisys Stealth® software uses identity-based micro-segmentation techniques and encryption to protect data in data centers, the cloud and mobile infrastructures. Stealth creates segments within an organization where only authorized users can access information, while those without authorization cannot even see that those endpoints exist. Unisys Stealth consists of six distinct solutions: Stealth(core), Stealth(analytics), Stealth(aware), Stealth(cloud), Stealth(identity) and Stealth(mobile).


• | Digital Investigator™ is a browser-based application for total information management that gives law enforcement and public safety organizations the ability to share information across platforms of new and legacy applications, both in and outside an agency, and to integrate and filter social media information from a vast array of sources. It also gives them the tools necessary to capture, analyze and investigate data seamlessly and collaboratively to help prevent and detect crimes, while enabling robust analytics and cost-effective configuration of reports and other documents.


• | AirCore is a comprehensive Passenger Services Solutions suite of modular, web-based applications that enables airlines to reach customers across distribution channels including mobile, tablet and web. In doing so, airlines increase their agility in adapting to changing customer demands, while reducing cost.


• | Unisys Retail Delivery is an integrated, multi-channel, retail banking system that enables banks to perform tasks ranging from processing transactions to enhancing customer service to supporting self-service transactions such as mobile banking. The system includes the Unisys Transaction Manager™ suite of tools, applications and third-party products.

We market our services and products primarily through a direct sales force. In certain foreign countries, we market primarily through distributors. Complementing our direct sales force, we make use of a select group of resellers and alliance partners to market our services and product portfolio. 
Materials
Unisys purchases components and supplies from a number of suppliers around the world. For certain technology products, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although we make every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of our suppliers to deliver components and supplies in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. For more information on the risks associated with purchasing components and supplies, see "Risk Factors" (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
As of January 31, 2017, Unisys owns over 827 active U.S. patents and over 90 active patents granted in 11 non-U.S. jurisdictions. These patents cover systems and methods related to a wide variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, information security, cloud computing, virtualization, database encryption/management and user interfaces. We have granted licenses covering both single patents, and particular groups of patents, to others. Likewise, we have active licensing agreements granting us rights under patents owned by other entities. However, our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, patent license, or related group thereof.
Unisys also maintains 21 U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, and over 706 additional trademark and service mark registrations in over 99 non-U.S. jurisdictions as of January 31, 2017. These marks are valuable assets used on or in connection with our services and products, and as such are actively monitored, policed and protected by Unisys and its agents.
Seasonality
Our revenue is affected by such factors as the introduction of new services and products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of purchases. Seasonality has generally resulted in higher fourth quarter revenues than in other quarters.
Customers
No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales of commercial services and products to various agencies of the U.S. government represented approximately 20% of total consolidated revenue in 2016. For more information on the risks associated with contracting with governmental entities, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Backlog
In the Services segment, firm order backlog at December 31, 2016 was $3.9 billion, compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Approximately $1.7 billion (43%) of 2016 backlog is expected to be converted to revenue in 2017. Although we believe that this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be cancelled, with or without penalty. In addition, funded government contracts included in this backlog are generally subject to termination, in whole or part, at the convenience 
6

of the government or if funding becomes unavailable. In such cases, we are generally entitled to receive payment for work completed plus allowable termination or cancellation costs.
Because of the relatively short cycle between order and shipment in our Technology segment, we believe that backlog information for this segment is not material to the understanding of our business.
Competition
Our business is affected by rapid change in technology in the information services and technology industries and aggressive competition from many domestic and foreign companies. Principal competitors are systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. We compete primarily on the basis of service, product performance, technological innovation, and price. We believe that our continued focused investment in engineering and research and development, coupled with our sales and marketing capabilities, will have a favorable impact on our competitive position. For more information on the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Research and Development
Unisys-sponsored research and development costs were $55.4 million in 2016, $76.4 million in 2015, and $68.8 million in 2014.
Environmental Matters
Our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position have not been materially affected by compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material in 2017 and 2018.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 21,000 employees serving clients around the world.
International and Domestic Operations
We serve clients around the world, including multinational clients with operations in several regions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately one-half of our revenue was derived from the United States and Canada, and the remainder was derived from Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Asia and the Pacific region; and Latin America. 
Financial information by geographic area is set forth in Note 15, “Segment information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the risks of doing business internationally, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
