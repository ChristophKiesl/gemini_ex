Business


Overview


We are a nationwide
provider of credit products and services to small businesses and were incorporated
in the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania in 2003. In 2008, we opened Marlin Business Bank (“MBB”), a commercial
bank chartered by the State of Utah and a 
member of the Federal Reserve System, which serves as the Company’s
primary funding source through its issuance of Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured deposits.
In 2009, Marlin Business Services Corp. became a bank holding company 
subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and in 2010, the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia confirmed the effectiveness of 
Marlin Business Services Corp.’s
election to become a financial holding company (while remaining a bank
holding company) 
pursuant to Sections 4(k) and (l) of the Bank Holding Company Act and
Section 225.82 of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Y.
Such election permits Marlin Business Services Corp. to engage
in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial 
activity, including
the maintenance and expansion of our reinsurance activities conducted through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, 
AssuranceOne, Ltd. (“AssuranceOne”). 

The products and services we provide to our customers include loans and leases for
the acquisition of commercial equipment and 
working capital loans.
Our average original transaction size was approximately $18,000 at December
31, 2020 and our average net 
investment on Equipment Finance contracts as of December 31, 2020 was approximately
$11,000.
We acquire our small business 
customers primarily by offering equipment financing
through independent commercial equipment dealers and various national account 
programs, through direct solicitation of our small business customers and
through relationships with select lease and loan brokers. 
Through these origination partners, we are able to cost-effectively
access small business customers while also helping our origination 
partners obtain financing for their customers. As of December 31, 2020,
we serviced approximately 80,000 finance contracts having a 
total original value of $1.5 billion for approximately 68,000 small business customers.

The small balance commercial financing market is highly fragmented.
We estimate that there are
more than 100,000 independent 
commercial equipment dealers and other intermediaries who sell the types
of equipment we finance or require the types of financing 
we provide. We
believe this segment of equipment dealers is underserved because: (1) large
commercial finance companies and large 
commercial banks typically concentrate their efforts
on marketing their products and services directly to larger equipment 
manufacturers and larger distributors, rather than
to independent equipment dealers; and (2) many smaller commercial finance 
companies and regional banking institutions have not developed the
systems and infrastructure required to adequately service large 
volumes of low-balance transactions. We
focus on establishing our relationships with independent equipment
dealers who value 
convenient point-of-sale financing programs because we can make
their sale process more effective. By providing them with the 
ability to offer our financing and related services to
their customers as an integrated part of their selling process, our origination 
partners are able to increase their sales and provide better service to their
customers. By doing this, we are also able to gather small 
business customers to which we can sell additional credit products and services
through our fully integrated origination platform, 
which allows us to efficiently solicit, process and service
a large number of low-balance financing transactions. 

We generate
revenue through net interest margin on our owned portfolio
of leases and loans, from originating new contracts to 
generate fee income and to replenish our owned portfolio, and we may
sell populations of finance receivables to third parties in the 
capital markets as a source of liquidity and to manage the size and composition
of our balance sheet and capital levels.
We manage 
risk to our portfolio through performing a comprehensive credit underwriting
process for our origination partners and small business 
customers, and we continually monitor and analyze the performance
of our portfolio, assess our delinquency and credit loss 
experience against our underwriting criteria and determine whether
our performance is commensurate with our intended risk 
tolerance.

The following discussion outlines the significant products, services and
revenue-generating activities of our business. 


Origination Channels 

We use multiple
sales origination channels to access the highly diversified and fragmented
small-ticket equipment leasing market, 
including both direct and indirect origination channels.

  








-5- 
Indirect Channel
s.
Our indirect sales origination
channels, which account for approximately [90%]
of the active lease contracts in our 
portfolio, involve: 

• 
Independent Equipment Dealer Solicitations.

This origination channel focuses on soliciting and establishing relationships 
with independent equipment dealers in a variety of equipment categories located
across the United States. Service is a key 
determinant in becoming the preferred provider of financing recommended
by these equipment dealers. 

• Major and National Accounts.
This channel focuses on two specific areas of development: (i) national
equipment 
manufacturers and distributors, where we seek to leverage their endorsements
to become the preferred lease financing source 
for their independent dealers, and (ii) major accounts (larger
independent dealers, distributors and manufacturers)
with a 
consistent flow of business that need a specialized marketing and sales platform
to convert more sales using a leasing option.

• Brokers.

Our broker channels account for approximately 15% of the active
lease contracts in our portfolio and consist of 
our relationships with lease brokers and certain equipment dealers who ref
er small business customer transactions to us for a 
fee or sell us leases that they originated with small business customers. We
conduct our own independent credit analysis on 
each small business customer in a broker lease transaction. We
have written agreements with most of our broker origination 
partners
whereby they provide us with certain representations and warranties about the
underlying lease transaction. The 
origination partners
in our broker channels generate leases that are similar to those generated by our direct
channels.

Direct Channel
.
This channel focuses primarily on soliciting our existing portfolio of
approximately 68,000 small business customers 
for additional equipment leasing or working capital opportunities. We
view our existing small business customers as an excellent 
source for additional business for various
reasons, including (i) retained credit information; (ii) payment history; and
(iii) a 
demonstrated propensity to finance their equipment. 

Product Offerings


Equipment Loans and Leases.

We originate
both equipment finance leases and loans.
Generally, an equipment
lease is when the 
Company remains the owner of the equipment during the lease term.
An equipment lease may have an option at the end of the term 
for the lessee to purchase the equipment, whereas with an equipment loan,
the borrower
purchases equipment with the loan proceeds.
In the case of equipment loans, the borrower is the owner of the equipment
during the loan period but the equipment is collateral for 
the loan. Once the loan is fully repaid the equipment is no longer collateral.
The types of lease and loan products offered by each of 
our sales origination channels share common characteristics, and
we generally underwrite our contracts using the same criteria. 

We use the direct
finance method of accounting to record our sales-type leases and related
interest income. At the time of lease 
application, small business customers select a purchase option that will allow
them to purchase the equipment at the end of the 
contract term for either one dollar, the fair
market value of the equipment or a specified percentage of the original equipment cost. We 
seek to realize our recorded residual in leased equipment at the end of the
initial lease term by collecting the purchase option price 
from the small business customer, re-marketing
the equipment in the secondary market or receiving additional rental payments 
pursuant to the applicable contract’s
renewal provision.
Our leases provide for non-cancelable rental payments due during the initial 
lease term.

The terms
of our equipment finance leases and loans is equal to or less than the equipment’s
economic life, and generally ranges
from 
36 to 72 months. At December 31, 2020,
the average original term of the equipment finance contracts
in our portfolio was 
approximately 50 months, and we had personal guarantees on approximately
31% of our portfolio.
The remaining terms and 
conditions of our contracts are substantially similar,
generally requiring small business customers to, among other things: 

•
address any maintenance or service issues directly with the equipment
dealer or manufacturer; 
•
insure the equipment against property and casualty loss;
•
pay or reimburse us for all taxes associated with the equipment; 
•
use the equipment only for business purposes; and
•
make all scheduled payments regardless of the performance of the
equipment. 

  



















-6- 
We charge
late fees when appropriate throughout the term of the equipment finance lease or loan
.
Our standard contract provides that 
in the event of a default, we can require payment of the entire balance
due under the lease through the initial term and can take action 
to seize and remove the equipment collateral for subsequent sale, refinancing
or other disposal at our discretion, subject to any 
limitations imposed by law. 

Property Insurance on Leased Equipment.

Our lease agreements specifically require customers to obtain all-risk property
insurance in 
an amount sufficient to cover the value of the equipment
and to designate us as the loss payee on the policy.
If the customer already 
has a commercial property policy for its business, it can satisfy its obligation
under the lease by delivering a certificate of insurance 
that evidences us as the loss payee under that policy.
At December 31, 2020,
approximately 51% of our small business customers 
insured the equipment under their existing policies. For the others, we have
a master property insurance policy underwritten by a third-
party national insurance company that is licensed to write insurance
under our program in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
This master policy names us as the beneficiary for all of the equipment
insured under the policy and provides all-risk coverage for the 
value of the equipment. 

Through AssuranceOne, our Bermuda-based, wholly-owned captive
insurance subsidiary we reinsure the property insurance coverage 
for the equipment financed by Marlin Leasing Corporation and MBB for
our small business customers.
Under this contract, 
AssuranceOne reinsures 100% of the risk under the master policy,
and the issuing insurer pays AssuranceOne the policy premiums, 
less claims, premium tax and a ceding fee based on a percentage of annual
net premiums written. The reinsurance contract is 
scheduled to expire in September 2023.
As a Class 3 insurer under the Bermuda Insurance Act of 1978, as amended,
AssuranceOne is 
permitted to collect up to 50% of its premiums in connection with insurance
coverage on equipment unrelated to the Company, 
meaning that, through AssuranceOne, we may offer an
insurance product to cover equipment not otherwise financed through the 
Company.

Working
Capital Loans
. In 2015, the Company launched Funding Stream, a flexible loan program of MBB. The
success of this 
program and the growing demand by small businesses for convenient
working capital solutions prompted the Company to update the 
name of this program to Working
Capital Loans in 2018, while maintaining its commitment to a convenient, hassle-free
alternative to 
traditional lenders and access to capital to help companies grow their business
es. Generally, these loans range
from $5,000 to 
$150,000,
have 6 to 24 month terms, and have automated daily or weekly payback.
Business owners can apply online, in ten minutes 
or less, on MarlinCapitalSolutions.com.
Approved borrowers can receive funds in as little as two days.

Markets and Competition


In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initially focused our
efforts on protecting the value of our portfolio and assisting our 
customers that had been negatively impacted by the pandemic, including
initiating a loan modification program in response to the 
pandemic, and by assisting some of our borrowers by originating loans
guaranteed under the Small Business Administration’s
(SBA’s) 
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).
In addition, in response to the onset of the pandemic, we temporarily tightened
underwriting 
standards for areas of elevated risk, and we continue to update such risk assessments based
on current conditions.

Consistent with other market participants, after the onset of the pandemic
we have experienced 
softer demand for financing by the 
small business community we service due to challenges facing many industries
resulting from the continued economic fallout of 
COVID-19 across much of the United States.
In addition, we have noticed some lessors extending the terms of leases for
their current 
equipment, rather than entering into commitments to purchase and finance
new equipment, which may be driven by the uncertainties 
of this environment.
In response to the potential impacts on our business resulting from the pandemic, we
took a series of actions to 
preserve our capital and liquidity and reposition the business for success
once the full effects of the pandemic are realized and the 
economy begins to recovery.
These actions included: (i) temporary re-allocation of resources from
front-end origination activities to 
portfolio servicing and collection activities (ii) cost reduction initiatives that
led to a permanent reduction of approximately 80 
employees and (iii) a re-organization of origination and processing
platforms
to accelerate automation and digitization.
We are 
currently targeting the rollout of our digital origination platform,
which we are calling Express, by the middle of 2021.
We are 
continuing to monitor the evolving health crisis, and its impacts on our operations
and ability to serve our customers in this changing 
environment.
Any return to pre-pandemic levels of activity,
and the long-term impacts of this crisis on our market, remains uncertain 
and will be dependent on,
among other things, the timing and pace of the macro-economic recovery
and the execution of the strategy 
that we undertook in 2020. 

We compete
with a variety of equipment financing sources that are available to small and mid
-sized businesses, including: 

•
national, regional and local banks and finance companies that provide
leases and loan products; 

•
financing through captive finance and leasing companies affiliated
with major equipment manufacturers; 

•
FinTech companies; 

•
working capital lenders; 

•
corporate credit cards; and

•
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. 

Our principal competitors in the small-ticket equipment finance market
are independent finance companies, local and regional banks 
and, to a lesser extent, in the case of our national accounts channels, national
providers of equipment financing, some of which are 
national banks with leasing divisions. Many of our national competitors
are substantially larger than we are and generally focus on 
larger ticket transactions and in some cases international
programs. We compete
on the quality of service we provide to our 
origination partners
and small business customers,
as well as the pricing of our equipment finance and working capital products.
With 
the introduction of our Working
Capital Loans,
we also compete with FinTech
lenders. We have encountered
and will continue to 
encounter significant competition. 

We believe several
characteristics may distinguish us from our competitors, including
the following: 

Multiple Sales Origination Channels.

We use multiple
sales origination channels to penetrate effectively the highly
diversified and 
fragmented small-ticket equipment finance market.
We use both direct
and indirect origination channels.
Our direct channel involves 
soliciting our existing small business customer base for repeat business as well as identifying
other small business customers who 
need financing.
The indirect channel sources financing opportunities through our partner network
and our broker network. Our 
indirect origination channels, which accounted for approximately
83% of the 2020 lease and loan new origination volume, involve: 
(1) establishing relationships with independent equipment dealers; (2)
securing endorsements from national equipment manufacturers 
and distributors to become the preferred lease financing source for the independent
dealers who sell their equipment; and 
(3) establishing relationships with independent brokers who identify
opportunities for us. Our broker network accounted for 24% of 
the indirect channel’s 2020
lease and loan new origination volume.
Our direct origination channel accounted for approximately 17% 


  





-9- 
of the 2020 lease and loan new origination volume.
Highly Effective Account Origination Platform.

Our telephonic direct marketing platform and our strategic use of outside sales 
account executives offer origination partners a high
level of personalized service through our team of sales account executives and 
sales support personnel. Our business model is built on a real-time, fully
integrated customer information database and a contact 
management and telephony application that facilitate our
account solicitation and servicing functions. 

Comprehensive Credit Process.

We seek to manage
credit risk
effectively at the origination partner as well as at the transaction and 
portfolio levels. Our comprehensive credit process starts with the qualification
and ongoing review of our origination partners. Once 
the origination partner is approved, our credit process focuses on analyzing
and underwriting the small business customer and the 
specific financing transaction, regardless of whether the transaction
was originated through our direct or indirect origination channels. 
Our underwriting process involves the use of our customized acquisition
scorecards along with detailed rules-based analysis 
conducted by our team of seasoned credit analysts. 

Portfolio Diversification.

As of December 31, 2020,
no single small business customer accounted for more than 0.16% of our 
portfolio balance and leases from our largest origination partner
accounted for only 5.91% of our portfolio. Our portfolio is also 
diversified nationwide with the largest state portfolios existing
in California, Texas and Florida,
and we have a diverse equipment type 
and industry group represented in our portfolio, as outlined in the above
tables. 

Fully Integrated Information Management System.

Our business integrates information technology solutions to optimize the sales 
origination, credit, collection and account servicing functions. Throughout
a transaction, we collect a significant amount of 
information on our origination partners and small business customers.
The enterprise-wide integration of our systems enables data 
collected by one group, such as credit, to be used by other groups,
such as sales or collections, to better perform their functions. 

Sophisticated Collections Environment.

Our centralized collections department is structured to collect delinquent
accounts, minimize 
credit losses and maximize post charge-off recovery
dollars. Our collection strategy employs a delinquency bucket segmentation 
approach, where certain collectors are assigned to accounts based on their
delinquency status. We
also stratify and assign our accounts 
to collectors based on other relevant criteria, such as customers with an early
missed payment, risk profile and transaction size. This 
segmentation approach allows us to assign our more experienced collectors
to the late stage delinquent accounts. In addition, the 
collections department also focuses on collecting delinquent late fees,
property taxes, and other outstanding amounts due under the 
customer’s contracts. 

Access to Multiple Funding Sources.

We have established
and maintained diversified funding sources, with our wholly-owned 
subsidiary, MBB.
MBB is currently our primary funding source through the issuance of fixed and
variable rate FDIC-insured deposits 
raised nationally through direct platforms, listing services, and through
various deposit brokers. We
believe that our proven ability to 
access funding consistently at competitive rates through various economic
cycles provides us with the liquidity necessary to manage 
our business. (See

Liquidity and Capital Resources

in Item 7). 

Experienced Management Team.

Our executive officers have an average of more than 20 years of
experience in financial services. As 
we have grown, we have expanded the management team with a group of
successful, seasoned executives.
