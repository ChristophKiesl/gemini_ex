Item 1. Business
Business Development
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 19, 1969. Following an involuntary dissolution for failure to file an annual report, the company was reinstated as a Wyoming corporation on October 14, 1999. On January 28, 2000, the company, through a majority shareholder vote, changed its domicile to Nevada through a merger with EMC Energies, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The Plan of Merger provided for the dissenting shareholders to be paid the amount, if any, to which they would be entitled under the Wyoming Corporation Statutes with respect to the rights of dissenting shareholders. The company also changed its par value to $.0001 and the amount of authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares.
 
Prior to 1990, the company was engaged in the business of exploring for and producing oil and gas in the Rocky Mountain and mid-continental areas of the United States. The company liquidated substantially all of its assets in 1990 and was dormant until June 30, 2000, when it acquired, in a stock-for-stock, tax-free exchange, all of the outstanding common stock of a privately held Virginia corporation, Metwood, Inc. ("Metwood"), which was incorporated in 1993.. Metwood has been in the metal and metal/wood construction materials manufacturing business since 1992. Following the acquisition, the company approved a name change from EMC Energies, Inc. to Metwood, Inc.
 
Effective January 1, 2002, Metwood acquired certain assets of Providence Engineering, PC ("Providence"), a professional engineering firm with customers in the same proximity as Metwood, for $350,000 and accounted for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting. As of June 30, 2012, Providence was no longer an operating segment of the Company. A decision was made that the majority of the engineering portion of the business could best be handled through a strategic partnership with an outside engineering firm. We believe that continuing research and development efforts will soon enable us to meet code requirements for our products and will eliminate the need for individual engineering seals. The operation of Providence Engineering was dissolved in 2010 due to lack of profitability and engineering arrangements with a larger firm.
 
On June 28, 2019, Metwood, Inc. entered into an Definitive Agreement with Emerge Nutraceuticals, Inc.(ENI), a Florida Corporation. Pursuant to the agreement, 100% of ENI’s common stock (500 shares) was to be transferred and a wire transfer within 60 days of $300,000 was to be paid to Metwood, Inc. In consideration, fifteen million (15,000,000) shares of Metwood common stock was issued which were valued at one million two hundred fifty thousand $1,250,000 dollars. This purchase excluded the formulas for the products produced by ENI, which were spun out of ENI prior to the acquisition. Upon closing, two the Company’s manager’s, officers and board of director members, Robert M. Callahan and Shawn A. Callahan, resigned after appointing Mr. Keith Thomas, Shawn Phillips and Raffaela Thomas to the Board of Directors.

On June 29, 2019, the Company, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Cahas Mountain Properties, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company, (“Cahas”) a majority shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, Cahas agreed to purchase from the Company the wholly owned subsidiary, Metwood of Virginia, Inc., a Virginia corporation, for nine million four hundred thousand (9,400,000) common shares of the Company’s common stock which it held at a value of seven hundred fifty-two thousand ($752,000) dollars. As part of this agreement, all assets and liabilities of Metwood of Virginia except, the convertible note payable to Cahas of $50,000 which remained an obligation of the Company. 
Discontinued Operations
 
In accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results when the component of an entity meets the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-10. In the period in which the component meets held-for-sale or discontinued operations criteria the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations.
 
The Company disposed of a component of its business pursuant to the terms of the Definitive Agreement entered on June 28, 2019 resulting in the Company no longer controlling the subsidiary, which met the definition of a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the operating results of the business disposed are reported as income (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and 2018, and its assets and liabilities are categorized as held for disposal on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 30, 2019.
