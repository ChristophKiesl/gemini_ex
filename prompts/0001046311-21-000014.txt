Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The evolving spread of COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to the global economy and the hospitality industry, including in the United States, where more than 80% of our franchised hotels are located. The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments and other authorities and businesses around the world to impose or recommend measures intended to control its spread, including temporary closures of many businesses, "shelter in place" orders, travel restrictions, cancellation of events including sporting events, conferences and meetings, social distancing measures and other governmental regulations. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms, which has had a material adverse impact on the hospitality industry and the Company both financially and operationally. The development of effective vaccines and initial distribution efforts are significant and positive developments. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the hospitality industry and our operations remains uncertain and will depend largely on future developments, including the rate and pace of vaccination in the broader population, the severity and duration of resurgences or variants of the virus, and the effectiveness of actions by government authorities and the public to contain the pandemic.
The impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's business were first experienced toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, with domestic occupancy levels ranging between 25.5% and 32.5% in the last ten days of March resulting in significant decreases in revenue per available room ("RevPAR"). Lower occupancy and RevPAR trends continued into the second quarter of 2020, with 
domestic RevPAR experiencing a decline of approximately 60.1% from the comparative prior year April. These trends have steadily improved, albeit remained significantly impacted, in the third and fourth quarters, with domestic RevPAR experiencing a decline of approximately 28.8% over the comparative prior year third quarter and 25.1% over the comparative prior year fourth quarter. For the reasons cited above, we expect significant impact on our results of operations to continue in 2021. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 10% of the Company's domestic hotel system that had temporarily suspended operations due to governmental restriction or a franchisee’s election, compared to less than 1% as of both December 31, 2020, and January 31, 2021.
While the ultimate impact and duration of COVID-19 is uncertain and will depend on future developments, which are difficult to predict, the Company believes that it will continue to benefit in the long-term from its primarily franchise-only business model, which has historically provided a relatively stable earnings stream and low capital expenditure requirements. Further, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $834.8 million in cash and additional borrowing capacity through its senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
Based on our business model, the financial mitigation measures described below, and information known at this time, the Company believes that cash flows from operations and available financing capacity are adequate to meet the expected future operating, investing and financing needs of the business.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented measures to focus on the safety of our customers, employees, franchisees and their staff, while at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact on franchisees' and our Company's financial position and operations. The duration of these measures cannot be predicted at this time. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Implemented fee-deferral programs for domestic and international franchisees.
•Reduced one-time reputation management fees and guest relations handling fees.
•Extended capital-intensive brand deadlines and created more flexible brand standard options to assist franchisees.
•Advocated to increase the benefits and eligibility requirements for government relief SBA programs and other CARES Act benefits to support franchisees in retaining employees and servicing debt.
•Established a proactive, ongoing multi-channel franchisee outreach and education program that is actively assisting our franchisees in accessing newly available capital.
•Revised the Company's guest cancellation policy to provide travelers greater flexibility during these challenging times.
•Implemented travel restrictions and work-from-home practices for the Company’s employees.
The Company made a priority of working closely with its franchisees to drive business to their hotels across a wide variety of industries and government and emergency-management agencies. Many of the Company's franchisees committed their rooms inventory at discounted rates, or on a complimentary basis, to support their communities in dealing with the effects of the pandemic, opening their hotels for hospital overflows and providing temporary housing for first responders, the National Guard, healthcare workers, critical infrastructure workers and others in dire need. In addition, the Company provided hotel room donations to Operation Homefront to help ill and injured service members that were displaced by the pandemic. The Company also teamed up with Serta, Inc. to contribute to its “Stay Home, Send Beds” initiative, which provided bed donations to help address nationwide shortages at hospitals and temporary medical facilities.
Since the onset of the pandemic, management and the Board of Directors have taken steps to adjust the Company’s cost structure and increase its financial flexibility, which include, but are not limited to, the following actions:
•Reduced the compensation of the Board of Directors, chief executive officer, and other executive officers.
•Reduced global workforce by approximately 18% since December 31, 2019 through a combination of layoffs and furloughs.
•Introduced a hiring freeze, except with respect to certain critical positions.
•Suspended associates’ 401(k) match through the end of 2020.
•Eliminated, reduced or deferred non-essential expenditures, discretionary capital expenditures and investments. We are actively working with vendors to achieve relief on fees or timing of fee payment.
•Temporarily suspended activity under the Company’s share repurchase program.
•Determined to temporarily suspend future, undeclared dividends while the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly impacting travel.
•Entered into a $250 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") on a precautionary basis, enhancing the Company’s financial flexibility by increasing its borrowing capacity.
•Offered $450 million of 3.70% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (the "2020 Senior Notes"), using net proceeds to repay the Term Loan in full and fund the $197.8 million purchase price of the cash tender offer (the "Tender Offer") for approximately $183.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2022 (the "2012 Senior Notes").
As disclosed above, domestic occupancy of the Company's branded hotels has been severely impacted. However, approximately 90% of the Company’s domestic hotels are in suburban, small town and interstate locations and have experienced less severe occupancy declines related to COVID-19 than hotels in urban centers or resorts. Based on industry data, the Company's brands have been performing ahead of its upper-midscale, midscale and economy chain scale competitors, and the Company’s hotels have experienced relatively stronger same-store RevPAR share gains versus their local competition from mid-March through the end of 2020.
Given the uncertainty as to the potential duration of the crisis, including a potential resurgence of the virus, and its severity, the Company does not expect material improvement in the industry until there is a sense that the spread of the virus has been contained, shelter-in-place orders have been lifted, and economic forecasts begin to improve. As the industry continues to recover, the Company believes it will continue to benefit from the expected faster rebound of leisure demand as a result of its higher share of leisure travel mix relative to competitors. The Company's properties are also well distributed in drive-to markets, which the Company believes will lead in the demand recovery for the industry.
While the Company believes that the long-term fundamentals of the business remain strong, it will continue to adjust business contingency plans as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Overview
We are primarily a hotel franchisor with franchise agreements and owned hotels representing 7,147 hotels open comprising 597,977 rooms and 1,022 hotels under construction, awaiting conversion or approved for development comprising 86,264 rooms as of December 31, 2020, located in 50 states, the District of Columbia and over 40 countries and territories outside the United States. Our brand names include Comfort Inn®, Comfort Suites®, Quality®, Clarion®, Clarion Pointe™, Ascend Hotel Collection®, Sleep Inn®, Econo Lodge®, Rodeway Inn®, MainStay Suites®, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel®, WoodSpring Suites®, Everhome Suites®, and Cambria® Hotels (collectively, the "Choice brands").
On January 27, 2020, we announced the launch of Everhome Suites, a new-construction midscale extended-stay brand offering. We expect to open the first Everhome Suites hotel in 2021.
The Company's primary segment is the hotel franchising business, which represents approximately 96% of the Company's total revenues. The Company's domestic operations are conducted through direct franchising relationships and the ownership of five Cambria hotels, while its international franchise operations are conducted through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising relationships. Master franchising relationships are governed by master franchising agreements which generally provide the master franchisee with the right to use our brands and sub-license the use of our brands in a specific geographic region, usually for a fee.
With a primary focus on hotel franchising, we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business. The fee and cost structure of our franchising business provides opportunities to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms and effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts resulting in increased initial and relicensing fee revenue, ongoing royalty fees, and procurement services revenues. In addition, our operating results can also be improved through our company-wide efforts related to improving property-level performance and expanding the number of partnerships with travel related companies.
The principal factors that affect the Company’s results are: the number and relative mix of hotel rooms in the various hotel lodging price categories; growth in the number of hotel rooms owned and under franchise; occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels in our system; the effective royalty rate achieved on our franchise agreements; the level of franchise sales and relicensing activity; the number of qualified vendor arrangements and travel related partnerships and the level of engagement with these partners by our franchisees and guests; and our ability to manage costs. The number of rooms in our hotel system and the occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the Company’s results because our fees are based upon room revenues or the number of rooms at owned and franchised hotels. All of these factors have been and we expect will continue to be materially disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The key industry standard for measuring hotel-operating performance is RevPAR, which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized. Our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises. Accordingly, over the long-term, any continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our annual 2020 results and anticipated trends are discussed above under the heading "Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic" and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We are required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation system fees we collect for system-wide marketing and reservation activities. These expenditures, which include advertising costs and costs to maintain our central 
reservations and property management systems, enhance awareness and consumer preference for our brands and deliver guests to our franchisees. Greater awareness and preference promotes long-term growth in business delivery to our franchisees and increases the desirability of our brands to hotel owners and developers, which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the Company. While we continue to actively manage and eliminate certain discretionary marketing and reservation system expenditures, as a result of lower occupancy and therefore, lower marketing and reservation system fees generated, we realized marketing and reservation expenditures in excess of fees in 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect significant impact to our marketing and reservation fees generated to continue in 2021.
Our Company articulates its mission as a commitment to our franchisees’ profitability by providing our franchisees with hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise. We have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees’ success that focuses on delivering guests to hotels and reducing hotel operating costs. The Company has taken numerous measures to combat the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These measures have been and remain an immediate priority in order to mitigate the financial impacts to our franchisees and the Company. We believe these immediate measures support the Company's preparedness and complement the strategic priorities we execute against to create value for our shareholders over the long-term.
In addition to our hotel franchising business, we have also developed or purchased five Cambria hotels. We intend to continue to strategically develop or purchase Cambria hotels to increase the presence of our Cambria Hotel brand in the United States, drive greater guest satisfaction and brand preference, and ultimately increase the number of franchise agreements awarded. When developing or purchasing hotels, we seek key markets with strong growth potential that will improve the recognition of the Cambria Hotel brand. We believe our owned Cambria hotels provide us the opportunity to support and accelerate growth of the brand. We do not anticipate owning these hotels on a permanent basis and expect to target dispositions to a franchisee in the future.
A key component of our strategy for owned hotels is to maximize revenues and manage costs. We strive to optimize revenues by focusing on revenue management, increasing guest loyalty, expanding Cambria Hotels' brand awareness with targeted customer segments, and providing superior guest service. We currently do not manage our owned hotels but utilize the services of third-party management companies who provide their own employees. We manage costs by setting performance goals for our hotel management companies and optimizing distribution channels. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of our owned hotels was significantly impacted in 2020 and we expect such impacts to continue in 2021.
Our capital allocation decisions, including capital structure and uses of capital, are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders. We believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position. We strive to maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to return value to our shareholders primarily through share repurchases, dividends and investing in growth opportunities. In light of uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, during the second quarter of 2020 we determined to suspend future, undeclared dividends and have temporarily suspended activity under the Company's share repurchase program. Given our long-standing commitment to returning value to shareholders, we expect to consider resuming payment of a quarterly dividend and/or resuming activity under the share repurchase program at such time that conditions are appropriate. We currently have no estimated time frame for when these may occur.
The Company also allocates capital to financing, investment and guaranty support to incent franchise development for certain brands in strategic markets; hotel ownership; and exploring growth opportunities in business areas that are adjacent or complementary to our core hotel franchising business, which leverage our core competencies and are additive to our franchising business model. The timing and amount of these investments are subject to market and other conditions. In light of uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to preserve liquidity, we have limited significant discretionary investments and intend to continue to do so until such time as we determine conditions are appropriate to resume any such activity.
Our direct real estate exposure is currently limited to activity in the United States, including our Cambria hotel assets open and under development and a commercial office building. In addition, our development activities that involve financing, equity investments and guaranty support to hotel developers create limited additional exposure to the real estate markets. For additional information, see the "Investing Activities" caption under the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The Company was incorporated in 1980 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
The Lodging Industry
Companies participating in the lodging industry primarily do so through a combination of one or more of the three primary lodging industry activities: ownership, franchising and management. A company’s relative reliance on each of these activities determines which drivers most influence its profitability.
•Ownership requires a substantial capital commitment and involves the most risk but offers high returns due to the owner’s ability to influence margins by driving RevPAR, managing operating expenses and providing financial leverage. The ownership model has a high fixed-cost structure that results in a high degree of operating leverage relative to RevPAR performance. As a result, profits escalate rapidly in a lodging up-cycle but erode quickly in a downturn as costs rarely decline as fast as revenue. Profits from an ownership model increase at a greater rate from RevPAR growth attributable to average daily rate ("ADR") growth, than from occupancy gains since there are more incremental costs associated with higher guest volumes compared to higher pricing.
•Franchisors license their brands to a hotel owner, giving the hotel owner the right to use the brand name, logo, operating practices, and reservations systems in exchange for a fee and an agreement to operate the hotel in accordance with the franchisor’s brand standards. Under a typical franchise agreement, the hotel owner pays the franchisor an initial fee, a percentage-of-revenue royalty fee and a marketing & reservation systems fee. A franchisor’s revenues are dependent on the number of rooms in its system and the top-line performance of those hotels. Earnings drivers include RevPAR increases, unit growth and effective royalty rate improvement. Franchisors enjoy significant operating leverage in their business model since it typically costs little to add a new hotel franchise to an existing system. Franchisors normally benefit from higher industry supply growth, because unit growth usually outpaces lower RevPAR resulting from excess supply. As a result, franchisors benefit from both RevPAR growth and supply increases which aids in reducing the impact of lodging industry economic cycles.
•Management companies operate hotels for owners that do not have the expertise and/or the desire to self-manage. These companies collect management fees predominately based on revenues earned and/or profits generated. Similar to franchising activities, the key drivers of revenue based management fees are RevPAR and unit growth. Similar to ownership activities, profit based fees are driven by improved hotel margins and RevPAR growth.
Similar to other industries, lodging experiences both positive and negative operating cycles. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms, which has had a material adverse impact on the hospitality industry and the Company both financially and operationally. The duration of the negative operating cycle resulting from the pandemic remains unknown, however we anticipate negative impacts to persist in 2021.
Independent of the present operating cycle, there are general trajectories and characteristics of positive and negative cycles. Positive cycles are characterized as periods of sustained occupancy growth, increasing room rates and hotel development. These cycles usually continue until either the economy sustains a prolonged downturn, excess supply conditions exist or some external factor occurs such as war, terrorism, pandemic or natural resource shortages. Negative cycles are characterized by hoteliers reducing room rates to stimulate occupancy and a reduction of hotel development. Industry recovery usually begins with an increase in occupancy followed by hoteliers increasing room rates. As demand begins to exceed room supply, occupancies and rates continue to improve. These factors result in increased hotel development.
Hotel room supply growth is cyclical as hotel construction responds to interest rates, construction and material supply conditions, capital availability and industry fundamentals. Historically, the industry has added hotel rooms to its inventory through new construction due largely to favorable lending environments that encouraged hotel development. Typically, hotel development continues during favorable lending environments until the increase in room supply outpaces demand. The excess supply eventually results in lower occupancies, which results in hoteliers reducing room rates to stimulate demand, and reduced hotel development. Over time, the slow growth in hotel supply results in increased occupancy rates and allows hotels to again raise room rates. The increase in occupancy and room rates serves as a catalyst for increased hotel development.
As a franchisor with 7,147 opened hotels, including ownership of five hotels, we believe we are generally well positioned in any stage of the lodging cycle as our fee-for-service business model has historically delivered predictable, profitable, long-term growth in a variety of lodging and economic environments. We have historically benefited from both the RevPAR gains typically experienced in the early stages of recovery, as our revenues are based on our franchisees’ gross room revenues, and the supply growth normally occurring in the later stages as we increase our portfolio size. The ultimate impact and duration of the present negative operating cycle resulting from the pandemic remains to be seen.
The Company’s portfolio of brands offers both new construction and conversion opportunities. Our new construction brands typically benefit from periods of supply growth and favorable capital availability and pricing. Our conversion brands also benefit from periods of supply growth as the construction of hotels increases the need for existing hotels to seek new brand affiliations. Furthermore, the Company's conversion brands generally benefit from lodging cycle downturns as our unit growth has been historically driven from the conversion of independent and other hotel chain affiliates into our system as these hotels endeavor to improve their performance, which typically outpace closures of hotels in our system resulting from the downturn.
The lodging industry can be divided into chain scale categories or groupings of generally competitive brands as follows:

Chain Scale | Brand Examples | Room Count | % of Total | | Avg. No. of Rooms Per Hotel
Luxury | Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, W Hotel, JW Marriott | 113,401 | | 2.1 | % | 316.8
Upper Upscale | Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton | 584,309 | | 11.1 | % | 313.1
Upscale | Cambria Hotels, Courtyard, Hyatt Place, Hilton Garden Inn | 812,110 | | 15.4 | % | 143.3
Upper Midscale | Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn, Fairfield Inn | 1,130,570 | | 21.4 | % | 97.4 
Midscale | Quality Inn, Sleep Inn, Best Western, Baymont | 428,025 | | 8.1 | % | 79.5 
Economy | Econo Lodge, Super 8, Days Inn, Motel 6 | 761,884 | | 14.4 | % | 75.2 
Sub-Total Brand Affiliated | | 3,830,299 | | 72.5 | % | 109.4
Independents | | 1,455,526 | | 27.5 | % | 65.9 
Total All Hotels | | 5,285,825 | | 100 | % | 92.6 

According to STR, the lodging industry consisted of over 57,000 hotels representing approximately 5.3 million rooms open in the United States at December 31, 2020. Approximately 78% of the new rooms opened during the year ended December 31, 2020 were positioned in the Upscale, Upper Midscale, Midscale and Economy chain scale categories in which we primarily operate.
The lodging industry consists of independent operators of hotels and those that have joined national hotel franchise chains. Independent operators of hotels not owned or managed by major lodging companies have increasingly joined national hotel franchise chains as a means of remaining competitive with hotels owned by or affiliated with national lodging companies. Over the years, the industry has seen a significant movement of hotels from independent to chain affiliation, with affiliated hotels increasing from 46% of the rooms in the market in 1990 to 72.5% of the market in 2020. However, the pace of this increase has moderated over the last several years and in 2020 the percentage of rooms in the market affiliated with a chain increased by approximately 70 basis points from 71.8% in 2019.
Due to the fact that a significant portion of the costs of owning and operating a hotel are generally fixed, increases in revenues generated by affiliation with a franchise lodging chain can improve a hotel’s financial performance. The large franchise lodging chains, including us, generally provide a number of support services to hotel operators designed to improve the financial performance of their properties including central reservation and property management systems, marketing and advertising programs, training and education programs, revenue enhancement services and relationships with qualified vendors to streamline purchasing processes and make lower cost products available. We believe that national franchise chains with a large number of hotels enjoy greater brand awareness among potential guests and greater bargaining power with suppliers than those with fewer hotels, and that greater brand awareness and bargaining power can increase the desirability of a hotel to its potential guests and reduce operating costs of a hotel. Furthermore, we believe that hotel operators choose lodging franchisors based primarily on the perceived value and quality of each franchisor’s brand and its services, and the extent to which affiliation with that franchisor may increase the hotel operator profitability. We believe these factors enhance the resiliency of hotels affiliated with brands, and as a result the value proposition of the franchise lodging chains, during a negative operating cycle.
Choice’s Franchising Business
As discussed above, the Company has taken numerous measures to combat the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These measures have been and remain an immediate priority in order to mitigate the financial impacts to our franchisees and the Company. We believe these immediate measures support the Company's preparedness and complement the strategic priorities, addressed below, we execute against to create value for our shareholders over the long-term. The impacts of the pandemic have not materially changed the fundamentals of the Choice franchising business nor our vision for deploying our family of fourteen brands, which represent both new construction and conversion brands and compete at various hotel consumer and developer price points.
Economics of Franchising Business. The fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities for us to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms, improving RevPAR performance and increasing the effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts. As a hotel franchisor, we derive our revenue primarily from various franchise fees. Our franchise fees consist primarily of an initial fee and ongoing royalty, marketing and reservation system fees that are typically based on a percentage of the franchised hotel’s gross room revenues. The initial fee and ongoing royalty portion of the franchise fees are intended to cover our operating expenses, such as expenses incurred in business development, quality assurance, administrative support, certain franchise services and to provide us with operating profits. The marketing and 
reservation system fees are used for the expenses associated with marketing, media, advertising, providing a central reservation system, property management systems, e-commerce initiatives and certain franchise services.
Our fees depend on the number of rooms in our system, the gross room revenues generated by our franchisees and effective royalty rates under our franchise contracts. We enjoy significant operating leverage since the variable operating costs associated with the franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises. We believe that our business is well positioned in the lodging industry since we generally benefit from both increases in RevPAR and unit growth from new hotel construction or conversion of existing hotel assets into our system. In addition, improving business delivery to our franchisees should allow us to improve the effective royalty rate of our franchise contracts.
Our family of well-known and diversified brand offerings positions us well within the lodging industry. Our new build brands such as Cambria Hotels, Comfort, Sleep Inn, WoodSpring, and our newly launched Everhome Suites brand offer hotel developers an array of choices at various price points for transient and extended stay business during periods of supply growth in the various hotel chain scale categories. Our brands such as Quality, Clarion Pointe, Ascend Hotel Collection and Econo Lodge offer conversion opportunities during both industry contraction and growth cycles to independent operators and non-Choice affiliated hotels who desire to affiliate with our brands and take advantage of the services we have to offer. 
Strategy. Our mission is a commitment to franchisee profitability by providing our franchisees with hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise. Our business strategy is to create franchise system growth by leveraging Choice’s large and well-known hotel brands, franchise sales capabilities, effective marketing and reservation delivery efforts, training and education programs, RevPAR enhancing services and technologies and financial strength created by our significant free cash flow. We believe our brands’ growth will be driven by our ability to create a compelling return on investment for franchisees. Our strategic objective is to improve profitability of our franchisees by providing services which increase business delivery, enhance RevPAR, reduce hotel operating and development costs, and/or improve guest satisfaction. Specific elements of our strategy include: building strong brands, delivering exceptional services, reaching more consumers and leveraging our size, scale and distribution to reduce costs for hotel owners. We believe that by focusing on these elements we can increase the gross room revenues generated by our franchisees by increasing the business delivered to existing franchisees and expanding our market share of franchised hotels in the chain scale categories in which we operate or seek to operate. Improving the desirability of our brands should also allow us to continue to improve the effective royalty rate of our contracts.
Building Strong Brands. Each of our brands has particular attributes and strengths, including awareness with both consumers and developers. Our strategy is to utilize the strengths of each brand for room growth, RevPAR gains and royalty rate improvement that create revenue growth. We believe brand consistency, brand quality and guest satisfaction are critical in improving brand performance and building strong brands.
We have multiple brands that are positioned to meet the needs of many types of guests. These brands can be developed at various price points and are suitable for both new construction properties and conversion of existing hotels. This flexibility ensures that we have brands suitable for creating room growth in various types of markets, with various types of customers, and during both industry contraction and growth cycles. During times of lower industry supply growth and tighter capital markets, we can target conversions of existing non-Choice affiliated hotels seeking the awareness and proven performance provided by our brands. During periods of strong industry supply growth, we expect a greater portion of our room growth to come from our new construction brands. We believe that a large number of markets can still support our hotel brands and that the growth potential for our brands remains strong.
We strive to maintain the strength of our brands by enhancing product consistency and quality. We attempt to achieve consistency and quality for new entrants into the franchise system by placing prospective hotels in the appropriate brand based on the physical characteristics, performance and amenities of the hotel and by requiring property improvement plans, when necessary, to ensure the new hotel meets the quality standards of the brand. Furthermore, we may require hotels currently in our franchise system to execute property improvement plans at specified contractual windows to ensure that they continue to maintain the product consistency and quality standards of the brand. 
We believe each of our brands appeals to targeted hotel owners and guests because of unique brand standards, marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, reservation delivery, revenue enhancing programs, service levels and pricing.
Delivering Exceptional Services. We provide a combination of services and technology based offerings to help our franchisees improve performance. We have field services staff members located nationwide that help franchisees improve RevPAR performance, efficiency of their hotel operations and guest satisfaction. In addition, we provide our franchisees with education and training programs as well as revenue management technology and services designed to improve property-level performance. These services and products promote revenue gains for franchisees and improve guest satisfaction which translate into both higher royalties for the Company and improved returns for owners, leading to further room growth by making our 
brands even more attractive to prospective franchisees. We develop our services based on customer needs and focus on activities that generate high return on investment for our franchisees.
Reaching More Consumers. We believe hotel owners value and benefit from the large volume of guests we deliver through a mix of activities including brand marketing, reservation systems, account sales (corporate, government, social, military, educational and fraternal organizations), and the Company’s loyalty program, Choice Privileges®. Our strategy is to maximize the effectiveness of these activities in delivering both leisure and business travelers to Choice-branded hotels.
The Company intends to continue to increase awareness of its brands through its national marketing campaigns and its Choice Privileges loyalty program promotions. These campaigns are intended to generate a compelling message to consumers to create even greater awareness for our brands with the ultimate goal of driving business through our central reservation system. Local and regional co-op marketing campaigns will continue to be utilized to leverage the national marketing programs to drive business to our franchised properties at a local level. We expect our efforts at marketing directly to individual guests and corporate customers will continue to be enhanced through the use of our customer relationship management technology and programs, as well as our field based sales agents that are focused on increasing our share of business travelers. Our continued focus on overall brand quality coupled with our marketing initiatives is designed to stimulate room demand for our franchised hotels through improved guest awareness and satisfaction.
Our central reservations system is a critical technology used to deliver guests to our franchisees through multiple channels, including our call centers, proprietary web and mobile sites, global distribution systems (e.g., SABRE, Amadeus), online travel agents ("OTAs") (e.g., Expedia, Booking.com) and internet referral or booking services (e.g., Kayak, Trip Advisor). We believe our well-known brands, combined with our relationships with many internet distribution web sites, benefits our franchisees by facilitating increased rate and reservations delivery, and reducing costs and operational complexity.
Leveraging Size, Scale and Distribution. We continually focus on identifying methods for utilizing our significant platform of hotels in our system, our relationships with hospitality related vendors and partnerships with travel related providers to reduce costs and increase returns for our franchisees. We are focused on expanding our platform business, which is reflected in our procurement services revenues, through key partnerships, new technology and other key franchisee resources. The expansion of these relationships has enabled us to further drive our top-line revenue and deliver tangible value-added solutions to our hotel owners and customers. For example, we create relationships with qualified vendors to: (i) make low-cost products available to our franchisees; (ii) streamline the purchasing process; and (iii) maintain brand standards and consistency. We also create relationships with key partners to market their services directly to our guests. These relationships provide value-added travel-related services to our guests and generate revenues for the Company. We continue to expand these relationships and identify new methods for decreasing hotel operating costs by increasing penetration within our existing franchise system and enhancing our existing vendor relationships and/or creating new vendor relationships. We believe our efforts to leverage the Company’s size, scale and distribution benefit the Company by enhancing brand quality and consistency, improving our franchisees returns and satisfaction, and creating procurement services revenues.
Domestic Franchise System
Our standard domestic franchise agreements grant franchisees the non-exclusive right to use certain of our trademarks and receive other benefits of our franchise system to facilitate the operation of their franchised hotel at a specified location. The majority of our standard domestic franchise agreements are 10 to 30 years in duration with certain rights for each of the franchisor and franchisee to terminate the agreement, such as upon designated anniversaries of hotel opening, before the stated duration. Our franchisees operate domestically under one of fourteen Choice brands.
The following table presents key statistics related to our domestic franchise system over the five years ended December 31, 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company revised its calculation of Occupancy. Historically, Occupancy has excluded rooms unavailable to our guests for operational reasons, as reported by our franchisees. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in reduced travel and lesser demand, our franchisees began closing greater portions of inventory as compared to previous periods. To provide a more representative depiction of system occupancy and with reference to industry standards for RevPAR reporting for partially closed hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have revised our Occupancy calculation to be reflective of full room availability for open hotels. Additionally, the Company made minor revisions to the calculation of ADR with respect to complimentary rooms. The revised ADR, Occupancy, and RevPAR are reflected in the table below for all periods noted.

International Franchise Operations
The Company conducts its international franchise operations through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising or master development (collectively, "master franchising") relationships. Master franchising relationships are governed by agreements that generally provide the master franchisee with the right to use and sub-license the use of our brands in a specific geographic region, usually for a fee.
Our business strategy has been to conduct direct franchising in those international markets where both franchising is an accepted business model and we believe our brands can achieve significant distribution. We typically elect to enter into master franchise agreements in those markets where direct franchising is currently not a prevalent or viable business model. When entering into master franchising relationships, we strive to select partners that have professional hotel and asset management capabilities together with the financial capacity to invest in building the Choice brands in their respective markets. Master franchising relationships typically provide lower revenues to the Company as the master franchisees are responsible for managing certain necessary services (such as training, quality assurance, reservations and marketing) to support the franchised hotels in the assigned development territory and, therefore, retain a larger percentage of the hotel franchise fees to cover their expenses. In certain circumstances, the Company has and may continue to make equity investments in our master franchisees.
In some territories outside the United States, hotel franchising has less prevalence in favor of independent operators. We believe chain and franchise affiliation will increase in certain international markets as local economies grow and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservations systems and marketing programs. We believe that international franchise operations will provide a long-term growth opportunity for the Company and as a result we continue to make investments which are expected to enhance the value proposition for prospective international franchisees.
The following chart summarizes our franchise system and operating results outside of the United States(1). The 2020 operating results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate impacts of the pandemic on international operating results to persist in 2021.

Franchise Sales
Brand growth is important to our business model. The number of franchise agreements awarded in 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate negative impacts to franchise sales activity to persist during the duration of the pandemic.
We have identified key market areas for hotel development based on supply/demand relationships and our strategic objectives. Development opportunities are typically offered to: (i) existing franchisees; (ii) developers of hotels or multi-family housing; (iii) owners of independent hotels and motels; (iv) owners of hotels leaving other franchisors’ brands; and, (v) franchisees of non-hotel related products such as restaurants.
Our franchise sales organization is structured to support the continued growth of the Company through awarding franchise agreements with a focus on revenue-intense chain scales and markets. The franchise sales organization employs both sales managers as well as franchise sales directors. This organization emphasizes the benefits of affiliating with the Choice system, our commitment to helping hotels improve profitability, our central reservation delivery services, our marketing and customer loyalty programs, our revenue management services, our training and support systems (including our proprietary property management systems) and our Company’s track record of delivering growth and profitability. Franchise sales directors are assigned to specific brands to leverage their brand expertise to enhance product consistency and deal flow. Our sales managers ensure each prospective hotel is placed in the appropriate brand, facilitate teamwork and information sharing amongst the sales directors and provide better service to our potential franchisees. The structure of this organization integrates our brands and strategies, and allows our brand teams to focus on understanding, anticipating and meeting the unique needs of our customers.
Our objective is to continue to strategically grow our portfolio by selling the Choice brands spanning the various lodging categories. Based on market conditions and other circumstances, we may offer certain incentives to developers to increase development of our brands, such as discounting various fees including the initial franchise fee, royalty fee and system fee, and providing franchise agreement acquisition payments to support development, property improvements and other hotel expenditures.
Because retention of existing franchisees is important to our growth strategy, we have a formal impact policy. This policy offers existing franchisees protection from the opening of a same-brand property within a specified distance, depending upon the market in which the property is located. The policy applies to most, but not all, of the Choice brands.
Investment, Financing and Guaranty Franchisee Support
Our board of directors authorized a program which permits us to offer financing, investment, and guaranty support to qualified franchisees as well as allows us to acquire and resell real estate to incent franchise development of the Cambria Hotels brand in strategic markets. We deploy capital pursuant to this program opportunistically to promote growth of the brand. The amount and timing of the investment in this program will be dependent on market and other conditions and we generally expect to recycle these investments within a five year period.
Franchise Agreements
Our standard domestic franchise agreements grant franchisees the non-exclusive right to use certain trademarks we own and receive other benefits of our franchise system to facilitate the operation of their franchised hotel at a specified location. Our standard domestic franchise agreements generally have terms ranging between 10 and 30 years. Generally, either party to our standard domestic franchise agreement can terminate the agreement prior to the conclusion of the agreement’s term under certain circumstances, such as upon designated anniversaries of the agreement, subject to applicable law. Early termination options give us flexibility in eliminating or re-branding properties for reasons other than contractual failure by the franchisee. This allows us the opportunity to strengthen our brand portfolio in various markets by replacing weaker performing hotels. We also have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if a franchisee fails to bring the property into compliance with contractual or quality standards within specific time periods. The franchise agreements typically contain liquidated damages provisions addressing franchisee termination at intervals other than those specified in the agreement which represent a fair and reasonable measure of damages that both parties agree should be paid to us.
The Company utilizes master development agreements (“MDA”) with respect to the WoodSpring Suites and Everhome Suites brands (and on occasion other brands). In exchange for a non-refundable fee, developers are provided geographic exclusivity to enter into a specified number of franchise agreements and develop properties of the specified brand. The upfront fees received on signing of the MDA are non-refundable and are allocable to the affiliation fees due upon the execution of each franchise agreement between the parties in the regions covered by the MDA. The MDA specifies development schedules the developer must maintain; if not met, the Company can terminate the geographic exclusivity, however the upfront fees remain allocable to future franchise agreement affiliation fees as long as the MDA remains in effect.
When the responsibility for development is transferred to a master franchisee in an international market, that party has the responsibility to develop and grow our brands in the covered region. The international master franchisee generally must manage the delivery of certain necessary services (such as quality assurance, reservations and marketing) to support the franchised hotels in the covered region. The international master franchisee collects the fees paid by the local franchisee and remits an agreed upon share to us. International master franchise agreements generally have a term of at least 10 years.
Franchise agreements are generally individually negotiated and vary among the different Choice brands and franchises, but we believe they are competitive with the industry standard within their market group. Franchise fees usually have three primary components: an affiliation fee; a royalty fee; and a system fee (for the marketing and reservation system). Our standard franchise fees are as follows:
QUOTED FEES BY BRAND AS OF December 31, 2020

 | Initial Fee PerRoom/Minimum | Relicensing and Renewal Fee Per Room/Minimum | Royalty Fees (1) | | Marketing and Reservation SystemFees (1)
Cambria Hotels | $500/$60,000 | $750/$65,000 | 6.00 | % | | 3.00 | %
Comfort | $500/$50,000 | $750/$65,000 | 6.00 | % | | 3.50 | %
Quality Inn | $400/$40,000 | $550/$45,000 | 5.25 | % | | 3.50 | %
Ascend Hotel Collection | $525/$45,000 | N/A/$45,000 | 5.00 | % | | 2.50 | %

Econo Lodge | $250/$25,000 | $500/$35,000 | 5.00 | % | | 3.00 | %
Rodeway Inn | $125/$15,000 | $375/$15,000 | 5.00 | % | | 3.00 | %
Suburban Extended Stay Hotel(2) | $225/$30,000 | $475/$30,000 | 6.00 | % | | 2.50 | %
WoodSpring Suites | N/A/$50,000 | N/A/$50,000 | 6.00 | % | | 2.50 | %
Everhome Suites(3) | $300/$50,000 | $550/$50,000 | 6.00 | % | | 2.50 | %

(1)Fees are based on a percentage of gross room revenue.
(2)For dual brand hotels that combine either the Mainstay Suites or Suburban Extended Stay Hotel brand with another Choice brand, we may increase the Royalty Fee and/or System Fee up to the standard amount for such other Choice brand.
(3)The initial fee is $50,000 for properties with 113 rooms or less. Each additional room is $300/per room for initial fees and $550/per room for transfers or renewals.
The Company’s franchise agreements are generally individually negotiated and, therefore, actual fees may differ from those noted above. From time to time, the Company may discount the standard Royalty fee and/or System fee in the initial years of the agreement as a franchisee acquisition strategy. Typically, these discounts expire as the contract matures until the contractual fees reach the standard franchise fees in effect at the time the agreement was executed.
Franchise Operations
Our operations are designed to help our franchisees improve RevPAR and lower their operating and development costs, as these are the measures of performance that most directly impact franchisee profitability. Our focus is not only to help increase the number of reservations delivered to our franchisees, but also to help increase the percentage of guest reservations processed through our proprietary channels. We believe that our proprietary channels, which include our loyalty program, propriety internet sites (including mobile and tablet applications), global sales programs and interfaces with global distribution systems, help deliver guests to our franchisees' hotels at the lowest cost to the franchisee. We believe that by helping our franchisees become more profitable we will enhance our ability to retain our existing franchisees, attract new franchisees, and improve the pricing of our franchise agreements. The key aspects of our franchise operations are:
Brand Name Marketing and Advertising. Our franchised hotels are typically located in areas conveniently accessible to business and leisure travelers, and therefore, a significant portion of hotel room nights are sold to guests who either walk-in or contact the hotel directly. As a result, we believe that brand name recognition and the strength of the brand reputation are important factors in influencing business and leisure traveler hotel accommodation choices.
Our marketing and advertising programs are designed to heighten consumer awareness and preference for our brands as offering the greatest value and convenience in the lodging categories in which we compete. Marketing and advertising efforts include national television, social media and digital advertising, online radio advertising, print advertising in trade media, and 
promotional events which include joint marketing promotions with qualified vendors and corporate partners. We also actively seek to reach travelers who are shopping for travel online by purchasing key search related terms and meta search ads from the various search engine providers to help ensure that our franchisees' hotels are prominently displayed to potential guests.
We conduct numerous marketing and sales programs and deploy field-based sales agents which target corporate, travel agency and group sales including business travelers, senior citizens, automobile club members, government and military employees, educational organizations, and meeting planners. Other marketing efforts include domestic and international trade show programs, targeted marketing campaigns (including print, digital, and social media), direct-mail programs, marketing e-mail programs, and centralized commissions for travel agents.
We operate a loyalty program, Choice Privileges, for all the Choice brands (except WoodSpring Suites) to attract and retain travelers by rewarding stays with points towards free hotel nights at Choice brand properties and through our partners that provide travel related accommodations. The loyalty program also offers guests the ability to redeem points for gift certificates at participating retailers, and earn airline miles from qualifying stays redeemable for flights with various airline partners. These programs allow us to conduct lower cost, more targeted marketing campaigns to our consumers; help us deliver business to our franchised hotels; and are an important selling point for our franchise sales personnel. The Choice Privileges program had approximately 47 million members worldwide as of December 31, 2020. Growing the membership of the Choice Privileges program as well as increasing the number of room nights consumed by existing members will continue to be a focus of the Company.
Marketing and advertising programs are directed by our marketing department, which utilizes the services of independent advertising agencies. We also employ home-based sales personnel geographically located across the United States using personal sales calls, telemarketing and other techniques to target specific customer groups, such as potential corporate clients in areas where our franchised hotels are located, the group travel market, and meeting planners.
Our field-based franchise services area directors work with franchisees to help them maximize RevPAR and improve the efficiency of their hotel operations. These consultants advise franchisees on topics such as marketing their hotels, improving quality and maximizing the benefits offered by the Choice reservations system. Our proprietary property management system, choiceADVANTAGE, includes a rate and selling management tool to help our franchisees better manage rates and inventory which are designed to help them improve RevPAR by optimizing ADR and occupancy. In addition, we offer revenue management services to our franchisees to assist them in optimizing their room rates and minimizing costs of reservation delivery.
Central Reservation System ("CRS"). Our central reservation system consists of our toll-free telephone reservation system, our proprietary internet sites, mobile phone and tablet reservation applications, interfaces with global distribution systems, and other internet reservations sites. We strive to improve the percentage of business delivered by our CRS as room nights reserved through these channels are typically at higher average daily rates than reservations booked directly through the property. In addition, increasing the percentage of business delivered through the CRS improves our value proposition to a hotel owner and therefore assists in retention of existing franchisees and acquisition of new franchisees.
Our CRS provides a data link to our franchised properties as well as to travel reservation systems such as Amadeus, Galileo, SABRE and Worldspan that facilitate the reservation process for travel agents and corporate travelers. We also offer rooms for rent on our own proprietary internet site (www.choicehotels.com) and mobile applications as well as those of OTA's and other third-party internet referral or booking services.
Our toll-free telephone reservation system primarily utilizes third-party call center service providers. Reservation agents trained on the reservation system have the goal of matching each caller with a Choice-branded hotel meeting the caller’s needs. We also operate a call forwarding program through which our franchisees can leverage our central reservation system capabilities by forwarding reservation calls received directly by the property to one of our reservation centers. Typically, this helps reduce the hotel’s front desk staffing needs, improves customer service and results in a higher average daily rate than reservations booked directly through the property.
We continue to implement our integrated reservation and distribution strategy to help improve reservations delivery, reduce franchisee costs and improve franchisee satisfaction by enhancing our website, www.choicehotels.com. We design our marketing campaigns to drive reservation traffic directly to our proprietary channels to minimize the impact that third party reservation sites may have on the pricing of our franchisees' inventory. In addition, we have introduced programs such as our Lowest Price Guarantee program which has greatly reduced the ability of the travel intermediaries to undercut the published rates at our franchisees' hotels. Further, we selectively distribute our franchisees' inventory to key third-party travel intermediaries that we have established agreements with to help drive additional business to our franchisees' hotels. These agreements typically offer our brands preferred placement on these third-party sites at reduced transaction fees. We continue to educate our individual franchisees about the risk of an unfavorable impact to their business from contracting with sites with 
which we do not have preferred agreements. We currently have agreements with many, but not all, major online third-party booking sites.
We also continue to upgrade our technology to ensure that our CRS can effectively handle the current and future volume on digital channels and support the industry's shift toward accelerated digital communications and guest experience personalization. In support of these initiatives, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company transitioned to choiceEDGE, a cloud-based software developed by the Company to manage all distribution for the Company by optimizing rate, inventory, availability, shopping, booking and reservations for its website, mobile apps and third-party distribution partners. 
Property Management Systems. Our proprietary property and yield management system, choiceADVANTAGE, is designed to help franchisees maximize profitability and compete more effectively by assisting them in managing their room inventory, rates and reservations. choiceADVANTAGE synchronizes each hotel’s inventory with our central reservation system, giving our reservation sales agents and other proprietary channels last room sell capabilities at every hotel. Our property management system also includes a proprietary revenue management feature that calculates and suggests optimum rates based on each hotel’s past performance and projected occupancy. These tools are critical to business delivery and yield improvement as they facilitate a franchisee's ability to effectively manage hotel operations, determine appropriate rates, help drive occupancy and participate in our marketing programs. As a cloud-based solution, the choiceADVANTAGE system helps reduce each hotel’s investment in on-site computer equipment, typically resulting in a lower total cost of ownership for property management systems than traditional on-site solutions.
Quality Assurance Programs. Consistent quality standards are critical to the success of a hotel franchise. We have established quality standards for all of our franchised brands that cover cleanliness, condition, brand standards and minimum service offerings. We inspect most properties for compliance with our quality standards before allowing a property to open as one of our franchised brands. The compliance of existing franchisees with quality standards is monitored through scheduled and unannounced quality assurance reviews conducted by a third-party periodically at the property and through the use of guest surveys. Properties that fail to maintain a minimum score are reinspected on a more frequent basis until deficiencies are cured, or until such properties are terminated. To encourage compliance with quality standards, various brand-specific incentives and awards are used to reward franchisees that maintain consistent quality standards. We identify franchisees whose properties operate below minimum quality standards and assist them to comply with brand specifications. Franchisees who fail to improve on identified quality issues may be subject to consequences ranging from written warnings, the payment of re-inspection, non-compliance and guest satisfaction fees, attendance at mandatory training programs and ultimately to the termination of the franchise agreement. Actual consequences, if any, are determined in the Company’s discretion on a case-by-case basis and may take into account a variety of factors apart from a franchisee’s level of compliance with our quality standards and brand specifications.
Training. We maintain a training department that conducts mandatory and voluntary training programs for all franchisees and general managers. Regularly scheduled regional and national training meetings are also conducted for owners and general managers. We offer an interactive computer and mobile-based training system to help train hotel employees in real-time as well as at their own pace. Additional training is conducted through a variety of methods, including group instruction seminars and live online instructor-led programs.
Opening Services. We maintain an opening services department that ensures incoming hotels meet or exceed brand standards and are properly displayed in our various reservation distribution systems to help ensure that each incoming hotel opens successfully. We also maintain a design and construction department to assist franchisees in refurbishing, renovating, or constructing their properties prior to or after joining the system. Department personnel assist franchisees in meeting our brand specifications by providing technical expertise and cost-savings suggestions.
Competition
Competition among franchise lodging brands is strong with regard to attracting potential franchisees, retaining existing franchisees and generating reservations for franchisees. Franchise contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow either the hotel owner or the Company to opt-out of the agreement at mutually agreed upon anniversary dates.
We believe that hotel operators choose lodging franchisors based primarily on the value and quality of each franchisor’s brand(s) and services and the extent to which affiliation with that franchisor may increase the franchisee’s reservations and profits. We also believe that hotel operators select a franchisor in part based on the franchisor’s reputation among other franchisees and the success of its existing franchisees.
Since our franchising revenues are generated primarily from a percentage of franchisees’ gross room revenues, our prospects for growth are largely dependent upon the ability of our franchisees to compete in the lodging market, our ability to retain existing franchises, our ability to convert competitor franchises and independent hotels to our brands and the ability of existing and potential franchisees to obtain financing to construct new hotels.
The ability of a hotel to compete may be affected by a number of factors, including the location and quality of the property, the abilities of the franchisee, the number and quality of competing lodging facilities nearby, its affiliation with a recognized name brand and general regional and local economic conditions. While the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the operating results of the Company in 2020, we generally believe the effect of local economic conditions on our results is substantially reduced by our range of products and room rates and the geographic diversity of our franchised properties, which are open and operating in 50 states, the District of Columbia and over 40 countries and territories outside the United States.
We believe that our focus on core business strategies, combined with our financial strength and size, geographic diversity, scale and distribution will enable us to remain competitive.
Service Marks and Other Intellectual Property
The service marks Choice Hotels, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Quality, Clarion, Clarion Pointe, Sleep Inn, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn, MainStay Suites, Cambria, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel, Ascend Hotel Collection, WoodSpring Suites, Everhome Suites, Choice Privileges, and related marks and logos are material to our business. We, directly and through our franchisees, actively use these marks. All of the material marks are registered or have registrations pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We seek to protect our brands and marks throughout the world, although the strength of legal protection available varies from country to country. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and other registered marks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic.
Seasonality
The hotel industry is seasonal in nature. For most hotels, demand is lower from November through February than during the remainder of the year. Our principal source of revenues is franchise fees based on the gross room revenues of our franchised properties. The Company's franchise fee revenues reflect the industry's seasonality and historically have been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, historical trends may not be reliable to predict future performance.
Regulation
Our business subject to various U.S. and international regulations, including regulations of the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), various states and certain other foreign jurisdictions (including Australia, France, Canada, and Mexico) that relate to the sale of franchises. The FTC requires franchisors to make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees and a number of states in which our franchisees operate require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have "franchise relationship laws" that, among other things, limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of franchise agreements.
Our franchisees are responsible for compliance with all laws and government regulations applicable to the hotels they own or operate. 
In addition, our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages (such as health and liquor license laws), safety and health standards, building and zoning requirements, tax laws, and laws governing employee relations, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements.
Further, we are also subject to various U.S. and international privacy and data protections laws, including the California Consumer Protection Act and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.
Impact of Inflation and Other External Factors
Franchise fees can be impacted by external factors, including, in particular, the supply of hotel rooms within the lodging industry relative to the demand for rooms by travelers and inflation.
We expect to benefit in the form of increased franchise fees from future growth in consumer demand for hotel rooms as well as growth in the supply of hotel rooms, to the extent it does not result in excess lodging industry capacity. However, a prolonged decline in demand for hotel rooms would negatively impact our business.
Although we believe that increases in the rate of inflation will generally result in comparable increases in hotel room rates, severe inflation could contribute to a slowing of the economies in which we operate. Such a slowdown could result in reduced travel by both business and leisure travelers, potentially resulting in less demand for hotel rooms, which could result in a reduction in room rates and fewer room reservations, negatively impacting our revenues. A weak economy could also reduce demand for new hotels, negatively impacting the franchise fees received by us.
Among other unpredictable external factors, which may negatively impact us, are wars, acts of terrorism, pandemics, airline strikes, gasoline shortages, severe weather and the risks described below under the Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Human Capital Management
The strength of our people is one of our greatest assets as a franchisor. We seek to attract and retain the best talent in the hospitality, franchising, and technology industries and provide an open and inclusive environment. We believe these objectives will yield a high performing organization that drives positive business outcomes for the Company, our shareholders, and our franchisees.
Our board of directors provides oversight on certain human capital matters, including through its Diversity Committee that seeks to assist and advise management and the board of directors in developing a workplace culture that values working with diverse groups of people, offering diversity of thought and perspective.
Career Development 
We empower our 1,498 associates across the globe to advance their careers by providing a career framework that allows them to understand and proactively manage their career path potential. Guided by a personalized development plan, each associate is empowered to identify and develop the skills and competencies necessary to prepare for their next, and future, desired roles. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has 1,353 domestic and 145 international employees.
Leadership development programs offer level specific career-building experiences, increasing the potential for broader levels of responsibility and leadership. These programs focus on competency-based self-development, creating customized action plans to grow and develop leaders, and the transformation of functional managers to business leaders, increasing their potential for broader levels of leadership responsibility.
The Company conducts talent review and succession planning discussions across all leadership levels. These are conducted with the board of directors semi-annually, focusing primarily on senior leadership levels.
Further, eleven Corporate Resource Groups (“CRGs”) allow groups of associates to join together based on shared characteristics, life experiences or interests. The CRGs are open to all associates to join. CRGs provide support, enhance career development, contribute to personal development, and provide networking opportunities.
Choice Culture and Diversity
At Choice, we are committed to nurturing an environment where every associate feels welcome, wanted, and respected – that’s our brand promise. Part of how we deliver on this promise is by weaving deliberate diversity initiatives throughout all levels of the enterprise, focusing on three core commitments:
•Diversity – Ensuring that the Choice workforce is an authentic representation of the world we live in where associates from different backgrounds may thrive.
•Equity - Providing fair and competitive pay regardless of gender, race, or other demographics.
•Trust, Belonging, and Engagement – Fostering a culture of belonging where associates are inspired and engaged and feel welcome, wanted, and respected.
At the end of fiscal year 2020, our domestic workforce was 35% diverse and 43% female. Our leadership, defined as Senior Director level and above was 11% diverse and 38% female. For these purposes, we define diverse as the self-identified demographic categories of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and other.
We are committed to providing fair and competitive pay. To ensure that we are delivering on our commitment to equitable compensation decisions, Choice conducts a gender and diversity pay parity study annually on all U.S. based roles and reports the results of this analysis to the board of directors. During 2020, we conducted this analysis and promptly resolved discrepancies identified between diverse / female base salary versus non-diverse / male base salary for positions of similar value (i.e., by career track, level, and salary grade) that cannot be sufficiently explained by the level of experience, performance, or other pay-related attributes.
The board of directors biannually reviews a diversity report focused on success against the Company’s annual diversity, equity, belonging objectives in workplace practices, franchisee development, advertising and marketing goals. The board of directors also receives updates on the Diversity Advisory Council (“DAC”), CRGs, and general inclusion activities. Our Diversity Framework that supports all our efforts is shown below.
The Company is proud to have been named as one of the Best Employers for Diversity, as well as one of the Best Employers for Veterans in 2020 by Forbes magazine. The Company has also been named one of the "Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities” with a top score in the 2020 Disability Equality Index and “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality” with a 100% Corporate Equality Index designation from the Human Rights Campaign in 2020. The Company offers a generous benefits package including a 401(k) matching program, paid family leave, paid caregiver leave, a monthly fitness subsidy, commuter benefits, a legal services plan, charitable gift matching, a LEED certified workspace, and paid volunteer leave.
COVID-19 Related Human Resource Matters
2020 was obviously an unusual year. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our 2020 human capital management. As of December 31, 2019, the Company employed 1,833 associates; on December 31, 2020, the Company employed 1,498 associates, resulting in a year-over-year reduction of 18% of its workforce. Given the cost management required to effectively respond to the pandemic and the accompanying economic slowdown, Choice rightsized its workforce, evaluating key positions and re-prioritizing associate focus on matters that most effectively supported franchisees and drove targeted business outcomes.
One of our highest priorities has been to safeguard the physical health and emotional well-being of our associates, all of whom showed incredible dedication to the needs of our franchisees, guests, and each other amid rapidly evolving circumstances all while caring for their own families. Key features include mental health support, including employee assistance and financial wellness programs, as well as creating opportunities for belonging and connections within the organization.
