Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
 We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Sesame Place and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests.
 We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other items, primarily within our theme parks. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the oceans, environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Culture and Social Responsibility” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Recent Developments
 Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic
 In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with enhanced health, safety and sanitizing measures, capacity limitations, modified/limited operations, reduced hours and/or reduced operating days.  In particular, on June 6, our Aquatica water park in Texas reopened; on June 11, all five of our Florida parks reopened; on June 19, our SeaWorld park in Texas reopened; on July 24, our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania reopened; on August 5, our Busch Gardens park in Virginia reopened and on August 28, our SeaWorld park in California reopened on a limited basis, following the State of California’s guidance for reopening zoos.  In compliance with revised state government restrictions issued late in the fourth quarter in California, we once again closed our SeaWorld park in California effective December 7, 2020.  Separately, we were unable to open our Aquatica water park in California and our Water Country USA water park in Virginia for the 2020 operating season.  Additionally, during the third quarter, the state of Virginia had a state mandated capacity restriction of 1,000 guests at a time which significantly restricted attendance for our Busch Gardens park in that state. On October 29, 2020, the State of Virginia revised its theme park guidance and modified the methodology for calculating capacity at theme parks.  As a result, capacity at this park increased from 1,000 guests to approximately 4,000 guests at a time. On February 1, 2021, in consultation with the State of Virginia, we increased capacity to approximately 6,000 guests at a time based on revisions to the methodology for calculating restricted capacity at theme parks.   On January 15, 2021, while our SeaWorld San Diego park remained closed, we introduced a limited time drive-through only experience for guests at this park. Subsequently, based on updated state government guidance issued in January 2021, we have since reopened our SeaWorld park in California on February 6, 2021 on a limited basis, once again following the State of California’s guidance for reopening zoos. In 2021, we have also begun year-round operations at our SeaWorld park in Texas and have begun to operate on select days at both our Busch Gardens park in Virginia and our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania.  These parks are now open primarily on the weekend and holidays during the winter season, weather permitting. We continue to monitor guidance from, and engage with, federal, state and local authorities and may adjust our plans accordingly.  
 Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have taken proactive measures for the safety of our guests, employees and animals, to manage costs and expenditures, and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these measures included, but were not limited to: (i) increased our revolving credit commitments on March 10th; (ii) issued $227.5 million in first-priority senior secured notes and $500.0 million in second-priority senior secured notes to raise additional capital and further enhance available liquidity; (iii) entered into amendments to our existing senior secured credit facilities to amend our financial covenants; (iv) initially furloughed approximately 95% of our employees upon closing all of our parks; (v) obtained payroll tax credits and deferred certain social security payroll taxes under the CARES act; (vi) temporarily reduced executive officers’ base salary by 20% through November 2020; (vii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of our parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managing operating expenses; (viii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managing marketing spend as parks reopened; (ix) substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (x) worked with certain vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments and; (xi) added additional levels of review and approval for payments and cash disbursements which remains in place.

Concurrent with the reopening of some of our parks, we began to prudently bring some employees back from furlough. Some of our employees remain on furlough while others have been transitioned from a furloughed status to a permanent layoff. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, resulting park closures and limited park reopenings have had, and are likely to continue to have, a material impact on our financial results.  See further discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Leadership Changes
 Effective April 4, 2020, Sergio D. Rivera resigned from his position of Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board.  As a result, the Board appointed Marc G. Swanson, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Elizabeth C. Gulacsy, our Chief Accounting Officer, to serve as Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in addition to her role of Chief Accounting Officer. Also on April 4, 2020, the Board appointed Walter Bogumil to serve as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Rivera was not entitled to any severance benefits in connection with his departure and forfeited his outstanding equity awards.
 The Board increased its size from eight to ten directors and elected Timothy J. Hartnett and Kimberly K. Schaefer to serve as directors of the Company on December 9, 2020.
 Our Competitive Strengths 
  
• | Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands, intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various consumer product offerings, including toys, books, apparel, and technology accessories as well as our websites and advertisements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks which deliver high-quality educational experiences, entertainment offerings, aesthetic appeal, and shopping and dining experiences. Our portfolio includes theme parks ranked among the most highly attended in the industry, including three of the top 20 theme parks and four of the top 10 water parks in North America, as measured by attendance (TEA/AECOM 2019 Report). Our combined theme park portfolio has over 650 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 88 animal habitats, 114 programs and 204 rides. In addition, we have over 350 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from educational animal encounters and presentations, to thrilling rides and exciting shows. In fact, we have won numerous awards and recognition. See further details in our theme park portfolio table located in the Our Theme Parks section which follows. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which at times can help protect us from the impact of localized events. Many of our theme parks showcase a different mix of thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions including rides, educational presentations and/or shows. This varied portfolio of offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our portfolio of theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We provide care for what we believe is one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our highly unique zoological collection and ability to present our animals in a differentiated, interactive and educational manner. Through opportunities to explore and interact with these amazing animals in our parks, each year we educate millions of guests with the goal of inspiring them to care and protect animals and their habitats in the wild. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote their health. We also lead, partner with and/or sponsor research efforts that have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help protect and sustain species in their natural habitats around the world. See the “—Conservation & Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our six decades of caring for animals, would be extremely difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our new rides and attractions). We believe that the limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed.

• | Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, currently led by Marc Swanson, Interim Chief Executive Officer, have an average tenure of approximately 16 years in relevant industries. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product and business development, hospitality, finance and accounting. Additionally, our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making us a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers and/or tourism destinations across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and vacation packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant Cash Flow Generation. We believe that our disciplined approach to capital expenditures, cost management and working capital management historically has enabled us to generate significant annual operating cash flow, even in years of declining performance. In addition, typically five of our 12 theme parks are open year-round, which helps reduce seasonal cash flow volatility. Due to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our cash flow in 2020 was materially impacted. We have taken significant actions to carefully manage our cash flow, reduce our costs and strengthen our liquidity as we navigate through this environment. For more details, refer to the “—Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” section. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are educational, fun and meaningful. Additionally, our Sesame Place park was the first theme park in the world to have achieved the designation of Certified Autism Center from the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (the “IBCCES”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided complimentary distance learning resources for students, teachers and parents to use as schools shifted to virtual classrooms.  These resources included standards-aligned classroom activities, teacher’s guides, videos, and animal information books.  By providing these distance learning resources, we were able to help families explore, discover, and stay connected virtually in a fun and inspiring environment even while our parks were temporarily closed.
 We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work.  For example, we are one of the primary supporters and a corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 38,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts.  
 Our Theme Parks 
 Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased property in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to both thrilling and family-friendly rides, educational presentations and spectacular shows. Our theme parks are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. 
 We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which we believe improves our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs.  Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names (see the theme park portfolio table which follows for more details on each of these parks and a summary of our recent awards and recognitions):

Capital Improvements
 We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay.  
 We previously announced a strong lineup of attractions which were scheduled to open in 2020 including 5 of the 10 most anticipated roller coasters of 2020 (USA Today, 2020).  In order to manage costs and expenditures and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic,  we substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of certain rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020. We were able to open certain new attractions in 2020 prior to the park closures including our award-winning Texas Stingray coaster at SeaWorld San Antonio. We are currently assessing the opening timelines for our new rides and attractions in light of capacity restrictions in place and may adjust our plans accordingly. We expect to open the following new rides and attractions in our parks:

• | Ice Breaker (SeaWorld Orlando): The first quadruple swing launch coaster in North America, featuring four airtime filled launches, both backwards and forwards, culminating in a reverse launch up a 93-foot vertical spike leading to the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Emperor (SeaWorld San Diego): The tallest, fastest, longest and first floorless dive coaster on the West Coast. After climbing more than 150 feet, the coaster car will dangle at a 45-degree angle before plunging into a 143-foot vertical drop that will accelerate riders to more than 60 miles per hour.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Iron Gwazi (Busch Gardens Tampa Bay): The tallest hybrid coaster in North America and the world’s fastest and steepest hybrid coaster, with the world’s tallest drop. Riders will climb more than 200 feet before plunging into a beyond vertical drop, reaching speeds of 76 miles per hour, and experiencing a dozen airtime moments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pantheon (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): The world’s fastest multi-launch coaster, will accelerate riders to a speed of 73 miles per hour and will include a 95-degree drop, four launches, two inversions, 15 air-time moments and a height of 180 feet.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Riptide Race (Aquatica Orlando): The first dueling pipeline slide in the state of Florida that will send riders racing through nearly 650 feet of slide all while navigating tight turns and accelerations alongside their opponents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Aquazoid Amped (Water Country USA): The first of its kind in Virginia, this new water slide experience will take guests in rafts through 59 fully enclosed color changing rings with dynamic sound spread over 219 feet of slide, providing a new thrill each time you ride.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Big Bird’s Tour Bus (Sesame Place): The whole family will enjoy a ride on this oversized, red double-decker bus with Big Bird and some of his furry friends. The bus goes around and around with a Sesame Street-inspired cityscape as the backdrop. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ride Conservation Partnerships
 We are pleased to announce partnerships with the following conservation organizations in conjunction with our new and planned rides, including: the Alaska SeaLife Center on our new Ice Breaker ride which will highlight animal rescue and climate change in the Arctic region; Penguins International on our new Emperor ride which will focus on penguin awareness and conservation; the Harte Research Center at Texas A&M on our new Texas Stingray ride which focuses on habitat protection in the Gulf of Mexico; and the Wilderness Foundation Africa on our new Iron Gwazi ride which will highlight the plight of endangered African wildlife.
 Safety, Maintenance and Inspection
 Safety is of utmost importance to us.  Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees.
 Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors, and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within, and that maintenance is conducted according to, the manufacturer’s criteria, internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation.
 A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials.
 In addition to our day-to-day maintenance and inspection practices for the existing rides in our parks, before new rides are introduced to our guests, an extensive review of the ride, from design through installation, is conducted by the ride manufacturer, internal technical and operational experts, local authorities, as well as competent third party inspectors and engineers.  Additionally, all new rides are analyzed according to a standardized, internal evaluation and acceptance process, which reviews, among other things, that the new ride operates safely and as intended, that the associated site and facility requirements for the ride operation are met, that the appropriate training of our employees is conducted, and that operational and maintenance procedures are documented.
 Our Culture and Social Responsibility
 As a purpose-driven company, our culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for our guests and, in many of our parks, inspiring our guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to social responsibility and strive to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. We create an environment in our theme parks, where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success.
Animal Care and Rescue 
 We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care, while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. During our temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, essential personnel, including our animal care experts, continued to provide for the health, safety, and nutritional needs of all of the animals in our care.  Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care. 
 10

The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, our parks are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third-party organization American Humane.
 We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians, and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. 
 We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations, including ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies, and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. 
 We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations around the world. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our population. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats.
 We are also a leader in animal rescue. During the time we closed our parks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our animal rescue and rehabilitation operations continued to operate to help wildlife in need. Over the last five decades, through December 31, 2020, we have helped more than 38,000 ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, including during our temporary park closures. 
 Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “—Conservation & Community Relations” section which follows.
 Conservation and Community Relations
 Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits, “Inside Look” events, educational presentations, and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through numerous national media and public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places.  We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. 
 We support conservation organizations such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started over 55 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet.
 11

Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more.  We also provide complimentary tickets and discounts to educators as well as active and former military and their families.
 Sustainable Operations 
 Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate. For example, in 2019, the first full year of the elevated solar panel project at Aquatica San Diego, the panels generated nearly 100% of the park’s annual energy use.
 We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks, including a natural biofiltration system in 2019 at SeaWorld San Antonio, which is the first of its kind in a zoological setting.  Many of our water conservation efforts incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings, and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere.
 We see the impacts of marine debris and litter along shorelines and in coastal waters, estuaries, and oceans – a visible reminder of the need to reduce waste. We have implemented programs to generate less waste in our parks and to increase our recycling efforts. For example, in 2019, we replaced polystyrene foam dinnerware products with products made from 100% recycled materials at all of our parks. We also have removed all single use plastic drinking straws and shopping bags, have an extensive recycling infrastructure in place in all our parks and actively encourage our guests to recycle.  Several of our parks have been externally recognized for their recycling programs.  In 2018, for example, SeaWorld San Diego was selected by the City of San Diego’s Environmental Services Department as a “Recycler of the Year” – the 20th time the park has received this award.  We raise awareness with our employees and guests about the need for all of us to do our part to address this global challenge.
 Responsible Sourcing
 Corporate responsibility extends to how we source the goods and services needed to operate our parks and to serve our guests. We have established a Responsible Food Sourcing Policy, which outlines our commitment to partner with food suppliers that deliver products that meet or exceed sustainable, healthy and humane food standards. For example, our parks have converted to 100% cage-free eggs.  We have also made a variety of commitments related to the sourcing of particular products. We have also set a goal of purchasing from suppliers that have announced a commitment and published targets to convert to group-housed humane farming. In response to growing guest demand, we have also taken steps to expand the number of plant-based food offerings on our menus across our parks. As part of these efforts, in 2019, we added a sustainable, plant-based burger to our menus at all of our parks. We have also taken additional steps, where possible, to identify and partner with brands and products in our parks which share our commitment to giving back to communities, animals, and / or our broader environment. 
Human Capital Management
 We have a diverse and mission-driven team of employee Ambassadors. Our team makes it possible each day to provide our guests with experiences that matter and to inspire them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,300 full-time employees and approximately 8,200 part-time and seasonal employees.  During our peak operating season in 2020, we employed additional part-time and seasonal employees, including high school and college students. Due to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of employees and the mix of employees in 2020 was impacted as parks are operating with limited capacity and limited operating days and/or hours. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  
 Our focus on recruiting and developing diverse talent has resulted in a management team that is approximately 50% female and 40% of a minority ethnicity.  Similarly, our overall workforce is 53% women and 50% of a minority ethnicity.  We don’t simply view diversity as a target, but rather a continual commitment to focus on creating the best and most inclusive workplace possible by recognizing and celebrating our unique backgrounds.  
 12

We strive to provide our Ambassadors with a competitive compensation package using market data including comprehensive benefits.  We provide market-competitive benefits including health, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, retirement, paid time-off, complimentary tickets and various other benefits.  
 In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and for the safety of our Ambassadors, we implemented new procedures which included remote work places when possible, social distancing, daily temperature checks, COVID-19 specific training and contact tracing to help protect our employees from the spread of the virus.  
 Safety is not just important as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide training and require certifications for certain positions.  We routinely review all procedures and safety requirements to promote a safe working environment for our Ambassadors, guests and animals.
 We believe that working for our Company is more than a job – it is a commitment to the protection of animals and the wild wonders of our world, while also providing a fun and meaningful experience for our guests that will be remembered long after they leave our parks.  We create memories that matter.  Our human capital programs, policies, and initiatives will continue to reinforce this belief in the years ahead. 
 Our Products and Services
 Admission Tickets
 We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. 
 Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours and educational animal encounters, specialty dining packages, and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience.
 We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. Additionally, in 2020, we introduced an online reservation system to help manage capacity and we are managing the number of operating days, operating hours and staffing needs by park to optimize cash flow.
 Culinary Offerings 
 We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences for our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal, and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions.
Merchandise 
 We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends, and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age.  Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient, and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs.
Consumer Products and Licensing
 To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a significant percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty.  In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street. We have also incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer™ and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC, which currently runs through January 2024.

Group Events
 At times we host a variety of different group events and meetings at our theme parks, both during the day and at night.  Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (e.g. family reunions) and fraternal groups, as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees.  
 Park buy-outs have historically allowed groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings, educational presentations and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, educational presentations, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, or a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts on the travel industry, group events in 2020 were impacted.  See the “—Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance.  
 Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances 
 We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value, and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund.  Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “—Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Seasonality
 See the seasonality discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Markets, Guests and Customers 
 Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States and 8 of the top 25 Best Destinations in the United States (U.S. Census, 2020; TripAdvisor, 2020). Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, historically our guests have included local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, travel from domestic and international markets were impacted in 2020.  See the “—Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

 Sesame License Agreement 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with a second Sesame Place® theme park scheduled to open no later than mid-2021. On October 21, 2019, we announced that we will open our second Sesame Place theme park at the site of the current Aquatica San Diego in the spring of 2021. While construction began in the fall of 2019, it was temporarily paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to open this park in 2022. After the opening of Sesame Place San Diego, we will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States, including the recently announced Sesame Street San Diego (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street® Land at SeaWorld Orlando, which opened in spring of 2019, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street-themed attractions. 
 In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. 
 The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “Sesame Street” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “Sesame Street” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “Sesame Place” and “Sesame Land,” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” 
 Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event.

International Development Strategy 
 We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. Construction for the Middle East Project is on track and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022. 
 For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.”
 Our Industry
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the theme park industry causing complete shutdowns or extended periods of closure.  Some theme parks have chosen to partially reopen with capacity limitations and enhanced safety protocols, which have allowed them to resume operations but with lower levels of attendance.  With the widespread introduction and reception of vaccines to fight COVID-19, we believe the industry will eventually return to its pre-COVID-19 levels of significant cash flow generation and growth. We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that over the long-term generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions.  
Competition
 Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies.
 Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), availability and cost of transportation to a theme park, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the level of attendance at theme parks has been and will continue to be impacted by public concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported local cases of COVID-19, travel restrictions, federal, state and local regulations related to public places, limits on social gatherings and overall public safety sentiment. 
 We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, diversity of product offerings and locations, targeted capital investments, guest sentiment related to our rescue and conservation efforts, and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment.

Regulatory
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to comply with rapidly changing local, state and federal rules, orders and regulations.  Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.  
Recent Regulatory Developments 
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”).  The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016.  We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations.  The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. These Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as a priority for APHIS indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter.  However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future.
 In December 2020, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs released its latest Semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for Fall 2020 (the “Fall 2020 Unified Agenda”).  APHIS did include on the Fall 2020 Unified Agenda a notice that it was planning to release a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in or around June 2021 related to contingency plans for the handling of animals.  This rulemaking would amend Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action would heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur.  Likewise, the full impact of these Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are released.
 For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.”
 We face a rapidly changing regulatory environment across our business, including responses to COVID-19, wages and hour regulations, employee health and benefit requirement and the policy agenda of the new U.S. President and his administration to name a few.  For more detailed discussion,  see the “Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” section and the following under the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and will adversely affect our results of operations and various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations; and The policies of the recently elected U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.”
 Insurance
 We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $100.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage which we believe is appropriate for our business. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions or co-insurance we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage 
 17

available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. For example, we expect that most of our losses related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be covered by insurance available to us and/or insurers may contest coverage.
 Corporate History
 Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states.  On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012.  We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”.  
 On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD. (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”).  ZHG pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of ZHG (the “Pledged Shares”).  ZHG subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain lenders (the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019.  On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with us pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent (the “SEAS Repurchase”). On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent. The purchase closed on May 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Hill Path owned approximately 34.7% of our total outstanding common stock.
