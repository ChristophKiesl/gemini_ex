Item 1 - Business
 
Bank of Commerce Holdings (“Company,” “Holding Company,” “we,” or “us”) is a corporation organized under the laws of California and a bank holding company (“BHC”) registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”) with its principal offices in Sacramento, California. The Holding Company’s principal business is to serve as a holding company for Merchants Bank of Commerce (the “Bank” and together with the Holding Company, the “Company”) and Bank of Commerce Mortgage (inactive). The Bank, which previously operated under three separate names, changed its name for all operations to Merchants Bank of Commerce effective May 20, 2019. We have an unconsolidated subsidiary in Bank of Commerce Holdings Trust II, which was organized in connection with our prior issuance of trust-preferred securities. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “BOCH.”
 
We commenced banking operations in 1982 and grew organically to four branches before purchasing five Bank of America branches in 2016 and acquiring Merchants Holding Company in 2019. In December of 2020, we expanded to San Francisco’s North Bay markets through the opening of a Loan Production Office (“LPO”) in Santa Rosa. We now operate ten full service facilities, one limited service facility and one loan production office in northern California. We also operate a “cyber office” as identified in our summary of deposits reporting filed with the FDIC. We provide a wide range of financial services and products for business and retail customers which are competitive with those traditionally offered by banks of similar size in California. As of December 31, 2020, we operated under one primary business segment: Community Banking. Additional information regarding operating segments can be found in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document.
 
We continuously seek expansion opportunities through internal growth, strategic alliances, acquisitions, establishing new offices or the delivery of new products and services. Periodically, we reevaluate the short and long-term profitability of all of our lines of business, and do not hesitate to reduce or eliminate unprofitable locations or lines of business. We remain a viable, independent bank committed to enhancing shareholder value. This commitment has been fostered by proactive management and dedication to staff, customers and the markets we serve.

On January 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Merchants Holding Company, to extend our presence in the Sacramento marketplace. Merchants Holding Company, headquartered in Sacramento, California, was the parent company of The Merchants National Bank of Sacramento (“Merchants National Bank of Sacramento”), a 97-year-old bank with approximately $211.7 million in assets as of January 31, 2019. See Note 21 Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this acquisition.
 
Our governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of our business effectively through an integrated process that includes financial, strategic, risk and leadership planning. Our management processes, structures and policies and procedures help to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines of authority for decision-making and accountability. Results are important, but we are equally concerned with how we achieve those results. Our core values and our commitment to high ethical standards are material to sustaining public trust and confidence in our Company.
 
Our primary business strategy is to provide comprehensive banking and related services to businesses, not-for-profit organizations, professional service providers and consumers in northern California. We continue to emphasize the diversity of our product lines and high levels of personal service. Through our technology, we offer convenient access typically associated with larger financial institutions, while maintaining the local decision-making authority and market knowledge, typical of a local community bank. Management intends to continue to pursue our business strategy through the following initiatives:
 
Utilize the Strength of Our Management Team. We believe the experience and depth of knowledge of our management team represents one of our greatest strengths and competitive advantages.
 
Leverage Our Existing Foundation for Additional Growth. Based on certain infrastructure investments, we believe that we will be able to take advantage of certain economies of scale typically enjoyed by larger organizations to expand our operations both organically and through strategic cost-effective opportunities. We have made investments in data processing, our staff, our risk and compliance function, and our branch network to support a much larger asset base. We are committed, however, to limit additional growth within acceptable risk parameters and to maintain appropriate capital ratios.
 
Maintain Local Decision-Making and Accountability. We believe we have a competitive advantage over larger national and regional financial institutions by providing superior customer service with experienced, knowledgeable management, localized decision-making capabilities and prompt credit decisions.
 
Focus on Asset Quality and Strong Underwriting. We consider asset quality to be of primary importance and have taken measures to ensure that credit risks are managed effectively to safeguard shareholder value. As part of our efforts, we utilize a third party loan review service to evaluate our loan portfolio on a semiannual basis and recommend action on specific loans if deemed appropriate.
Build a Stable Core Deposit Base. We continue to focus on increasing our stable core deposit base of business and retail customers. Our branch acquisition in 2016 allowed us to reduce our historic reliance on Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB”) borrowings and our former reliance on nonlocal time deposits. Our acquisition of Merchants National Bank of Sacramento in 2019 further enhanced our core deposit base by adding $152.2 million in demand and savings accounts. We intend to continue our practice of pursuing full deposit relationships with each of our loan customers, their business partners, and key employees.
Principal Market
 
We operate under the name Merchants Bank of Commerce in northern California along the Interstate 5 corridor from Sacramento to Yreka and in the wine region north of San Francisco.
Principal Products and Services
 
Most of our current customers are small to medium-sized businesses and retail consumers. No single person or group of persons provides a material portion of the Bank’s deposits or loans, the loss of any one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on the business of the Bank.
 
We provide a wide range of financial services and products for businesses and consumers. The services we offer include those traditionally offered by banks of similar size and character in California. Our principal deposit products include the following types of accounts; checking, interest-bearing checking, money market, savings and certificates of deposit. We also offer sweep arrangements, commercial loans, construction loans, term loans, consumer loans, safe deposit boxes, and electronic banking services. We currently do not offer trust services or international banking services.
 
The majority of the loans we originate are direct loans made to small businesses and individuals in our principal market. We accept as collateral for loans, real estate, listed and unlisted securities, savings and time deposits, automobiles, machinery and equipment and other general business assets such as accounts receivable and inventory. In addition to direct lending, our loan portfolio includes loans that were purchased as pools of loans, or participations where a portion of a loan was originated by another lending institution.

Regulatory Capital
 
Our regulators measure our capital adequacy and compliance with minimum leverage ratio guidelines. As of December 31, 2020, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s risk category. See Item 7 - Management’s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations and Note 17 Regulatory Capital in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for a discussion of the regulatory capital guidelines.
 
Competition
 
We engage in the highly competitive financial services industry. Generally, our market and our lines of activity involve competition with other banks, thrifts, credit unions and other non-bank financial institutions, such as investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies and insurance entities which offer financial services, both in “brick and mortar” locations and through alternative delivery channels such as the Internet. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures. Our ability to compete is focused on various factors such as physical locations, customer service, interest rates, lending limits, customer convenience and technological convenience.
 
Securities firms, insurance companies and brokerage houses that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type have significantly changed the competitive environment in which we conduct business.
 
In order to compete with major banks and other competitors in our primary service areas, we rely upon;
 

● | The experience of our executive and senior officers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our specialized services and local promotional activities; 
● | The personal contacts made by our officers, directors and employees;
● | Third party referral sources. 

Human Capital Disclosure
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 206 full-time equivalent employees. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and management believes its relations with employees to be good. See Note 15 Employee Benefits and Retirement Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for further detail on employee relations. Information regarding employment agreements with our executive officers is contained in Item 11 – Executive Compensation below, which is incorporated by reference to our proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.
 
At our Company, we have a strong commitment to human capital resource management. Our employees are central to everything we do and critical to our long-term success as a company. Accordingly, we are committed to ensuring our Company is a rewarding place to work. We deliver on this commitment by being an inclusive workplace for all of our employees, creating opportunities for growth and development, recognizing and rewarding performance, and supporting our employees' physical, emotional and financial wellness.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
Being a diverse and inclusive company is one of our core values. We are strengthened by the diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives of our employees and we strive to ensure our workforce represents the communities we serve - in thought, style, experience, culture, race, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. At our Company, we strive for diversity and inclusion at all levels.
Fair Wages and Benefits
 
Paying fair and competitive wages and supporting employee wellness are critical components of being a rewarding place to work. We pay our employees competitively based on market rates for their roles and how they perform, and we regularly benchmark against other companies within our industry to ensure our pay is competitive in the market for comparable roles. Our Company is committed to compensating all of our employees fairly and equitably based on performance, with equal pay for equal work, regardless of race or gender.
Emergency Preparedness
 
It is our goal to maintain essential business services and operations during any incident or emergency while providing safety for customers and employees. Emergencies may arise from severe weather or natural disaster, mass casualty, fire, bomb threats, acts of terrorism, pandemic or other events. We are dedicated to supporting our communities through the emergencies by providing loan assistance and donations of essential items.

We have developed the following internal policies to provide guidance during a business disruption:
 

● | Business Continuity Program (BCP); 
--+--------------------------------------------------
● | Pandemic Planning; 
● | Physical Safety & Security Management Policy; and
● | Teleworking Policy. 

Volunteering
 
Taking action to improve the well-being of others is a community responsibility and a commitment we have upheld since our founding. We are committed to being a socially responsible employer by fostering an environment of diversity and inclusion across our business and supporting our local communities. We provide direct financial support to those in need and also provide support to employees who generously give their time and talent to local civic and nonprofit organizations in the communities where we operate.
Environmental and Social Governance
 
We consider responsible growth and environmental and social governance leadership to be integral parts of our business. Responsible growth means we strive to grow and be successful in the marketplace by developing strong relationship with clients and by providing top tier service while maintaining our commitment to environmental and social stewardship. We realize that we must do this in a way that appropriately manages risk, ensures our growth is sustainable and enables us to continue to invest in our people, company and communities. Our commitment to environmental and social stewardship requires us to balance our pursuit of business opportunities against the need to address our state’s significant environmental and social challenges. In part, it defines how we deploy our capital and resources, forms our business practices and helps determine how and when we use our voice in support of our values. Integrated across our lines of business, our environmental and social focus reflects how we hold ourselves accountable and allows us to create shared success with our clients and communities.
 
On February 16, 2021, we adopted an Environmental and Social Risk Policy (“ESRP”) Framework. The ESRP Framework outlines our approach to environmental and social issues, and how that approach aligns with our fundamental business strategy of responsible growth. The ESRP Framework addresses issues including risk management, governance structure, public disclosure, external standards and enforcement. Moving forward, we will review this framework in light of feedback from stakeholders, future materiality assessments, market developments, evolving best practices and regulatory developments.
 
Government Supervision and Regulation
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
The Holding Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state law. In general, this regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund (the “DIF”) and the federal and state banking system as a whole; it does not exist for the protection of shareholders. As the breadth and scope of regulatory requirements increase, our costs to identify, monitor and comply with these requirements increase, as well.
 
This section provides a general overview of the federal and state regulatory framework applicable to the Holding Company and the Bank. It is not intended to summarize all applicable laws and regulations. To the extent this section describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified by reference to those provisions. These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, continue to be subject to change (or interpretation) by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulators. Numerous changes to the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to us (including their interpretation or implementation) have been proposed but cannot be predicted and could have a material effect on our business or operations.
 
The Holding Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve (as a bank holding company) and regulation by the State of California (as a California corporation). The Holding Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both of which are administered by the SEC. As a listed company on the NASDAQ Global Market, the Holding Company is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies. The Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (“CDFPI”).
 
Bank Holding Company Regulation – Federal and State
 
General
 
As a bank holding company, the Holding Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve” or “FRB”). In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to owning or controlling banks and engaging in other activities closely related to the business of banking. In addition, the Holding Company must file reports with the Federal Reserve and provide the agency with such additional information as it may require.
 
    8 

  
  BANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES 


Holding Company Bank Ownership
 
The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
Holding Company Control of Nonbanks
 
With some exceptions, the BHC Act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities that, by federal statute, agency regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks.
Transactions with Affiliates
 
Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the holding company or its subsidiaries, on investments in their securities and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) further expanded the definition of an “affiliate” and treats credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities lending, and borrowing transactions as a covered transaction under the regulations. It also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized, requires collateral to be maintained at all times for covered transactions required to be collateralized, and places limits on acceptable collateral. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Holding Company’s ability to obtain funds from the Bank for its cash needs, including funds for payment of dividends, interest and operational expenses.
Tying Arrangements
 
We are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither the Holding Company nor its subsidiaries may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either (i) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by us; or (ii) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor.
Support of Subsidiary Banks
 
Under Federal Reserve policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Holding Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. This means that the Holding Company is required to commit, as necessary, capital and resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Holding Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, or when it may not be in the Holding Company's or its shareholders' best interests to do so. Any capital loans a bank holding company makes to its subsidiary banks are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of those subsidiary banks.
State Law Restrictions
 
As a California corporation, the Holding Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable California corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in California include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records and minutes and observance of certain corporate formalities.
Bank Regulation – Federal and State
 
General
 
Deposits in the Bank, a California chartered commercial bank, are insured by the FDIC. As a result, the Bank is subject to supervision and periodic examination and regulation by the CDFPI and the FDIC. These agencies have the authority to prohibit banks from engaging in what they believe to be unsafe or unsound banking practices. The federal laws that apply to the Bank regulate, among other things, the scope of its business, its investments, its reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature, amount of, and collateral for loans. Federal laws also regulate community reinvestment and insider transactions and impose safety and soundness standards. In addition to these federal laws, the Bank is also subject to the laws of the State of California.

Consumer Protection
 
Although the Bank is not supervised directly by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), our consumer banking activities are subject to regulation by the CFPB. The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern its relationships and interactions with consumers including laws and regulations that impose certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we take deposits, make and collect loans, and provide other services. In recent years, examination and enforcement by state and federal banking agencies for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations have increased and become more intense. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank has established a compliance system to ensure consumer protection.
Community Reinvestment
 
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdictions, federal bank regulators evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A bank’s community reinvestment record is also considered by the applicable banking agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. In some cases, a bank's failure to comply with the CRA or CRA protests filed by interested parties during applicable comment periods, can result in the denial or delay of such transactions. The Bank received a "satisfactory" rating in its most recent CRA examination.
Insider Credit Transactions
 
Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral) and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lending bank; and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. The Dodd-Frank Act and federal regulations place additional restrictions on loans to insiders and generally prohibit loans to senior officers other than for certain specified purposes.
Regulation of Management
 
Federal law (i) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution’s federal supervisory agency; (ii) as discussed above, places restraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests; and (iii) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area.
Safety and Soundness Standards 
 
Safety and soundness standards unrelated to capital are also imposed upon banks. These standards cover, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. In addition, each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. An institution that fails to meet these standards may be required to submit a compliance plan, or be subject to regulatory sanctions, including restrictions on growth. The Bank has established policies and risk management procedures to ensure the safety and soundness of the Bank.
State Law Restrictions
 
California state-chartered banks are subject to various requirements relating to operations and administration (including the maintenance of branch offices and automated teller machines), capital and reserve requirements, declaration of dividends, deposit taking, shareholder rights and duties, borrowing limits, and investment and lending activities.
 
    10 

  
  BANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES 


Under California law, the amount a bank generally may borrow may not exceed its shareholders’ equity without the consent of the CDFPI, except for borrowings from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank is required to invest its funds as limited by California law in investments that are legal investments for banks, subject to any other limitations under general law. The Commissioner of the CDFPI may take possession of the Bank if certain conditions exist, such as insufficient shareholders’ equity, unsafe or unauthorized operations, or violations of law.
Interstate Banking and Branching
 
The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Interstate Act"), and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by state and federally chartered banks. Federal regulators now have authority to approve applications by such banks to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if the host state's banks could establish a branch at the same location. The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area. Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production, and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.
Cash Dividends
 
Our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders is dependent on having sufficient cash and satisfying various regulatory and contractual requirements and restrictions. Our principal source of cash is dividends received from the Bank. Regulatory authorities prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice or would reduce capital below an amount necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. Basel III (discussed below) introduces additional restrictions on dividends.
 
Our ability to pay dividends from the Bank to the Holding Company is also subject to certain requirements under California law. Banks chartered under California law generally may only pay a cash dividend to the extent such payment does not exceed the lesser of (i) retained earnings of the bank or (ii) the bank's net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders during such period. As a result, future dividends from the Bank to the Holding Company will generally depend on the level of earnings at the Bank.
 
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies which expresses the view that although no specific regulations restrict dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends unless the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a prospective rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the bank holding company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
 
On December 10, 2015, we issued and sold $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes. The Subordinated Notes limit the payment of cash dividends to our common shareholders if the Company is not well capitalized, or if there is an event of default as described by the note agreement.
 
Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action
 
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal regulatory agencies, which involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The capital requirements are intended to ensure that institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments and are applied separately to the Holding Company and the Bank.
 
Under the guidelines of Basel III, federal regulations require insured depository institutions and bank holding companies to meet certain capital standards (these standards include a capital conservation buffer), including: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 7%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.50%; (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 10.5%; and (iv) a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These minimum capital requirements became effective in January 2015 and were the result of final rules implementing certain regulatory amendments based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Final Rules").
 
The Final Rules contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on an insured depository institution if its capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following capital level requirements to qualify as “well capitalized”: (i) a Tier 1 common equity capital ratio of at least 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of at least 10%; (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%; and (v) not be subject to any order or written directive requiring a specific capital level. The FDIC’s rules (as amended by the Final Rules) contain other capital classification categories, such as “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” each of which are based on certain capital ratios. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain mandatory restrictions, including on capital distributions and growth. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional restrictions. An institution may be downgraded to a category lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. As of December 31, 2020, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as “well capitalized”.

  BANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES 


The so-called “Crapo Bill” (i.e., the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act) was signed into law by President Trump in May 2018. The Crapo Bill simplified the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and instructed the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) of between 8% and 10%. On September 17, 2019, the FDIC issued its final rule relating to the CBLR framework and established the CBLR at 9% for qualifying financial institutions. A qualifying institution that opts into the CBLR framework (and meets all requirements under the framework) will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements under the prompt corrective action rules discussed above and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. We are a qualifying institution; however, we have opted to continue reporting under the Basel III requirements. We can opt-in to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at any time in the future.
Regulatory Oversight and Examination
 
Inspections
 
The Federal Reserve conducts periodic inspections of bank holding companies to ascertain whether the financial strength of the bank holding company is being maintained on an ongoing basis and to determine the effects or consequences of transactions between a bank holding company or its non-banking subsidiaries and its subsidiary banks. For holding companies under $10 billion in assets, the inspection type and frequency typically varies depending on the complexity of the organization, and the bank holding company’s rating at its last inspection. The most recent inspection of the holding company was conducted in January of 2020.
Examinations
 
The Bank is subject to periodic examinations by its regulators, the FDIC and the CDFPI. In assessing a bank's condition, bank examinations have evolved from reliance on transaction testing in assessing a bank’s condition to a risk-focused approach. These examinations are extensive and cover the entire breadth of operations of the bank. Generally, safety and soundness examinations occur on an 18-month cycle. Examinations alternate between the federal and state bank regulatory agencies, and in some cases they may occur on a combined schedule. The frequency of consumer compliance and CRA examinations is linked to the size of the institution and its compliance and CRA ratings at its most recent examinations. However, the examination authority of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC allows them to examine supervised institutions as frequently as deemed necessary based on the condition of the bank or as a result of certain triggering events.
Commercial Real Estate Ratios
 
The federal banking regulators have issued guidance reminding financial institutions to re-examine existing regulations regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The purpose of the guidance is to encourage banks to develop risk management practices and maintain capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of their real estate concentrations. The banking agencies are directed to examine each bank’s exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on cash flows from the real estate held as collateral and to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in evaluating capital adequacy but does not specifically limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending to a specified concentration level.
Corporate Governance and Accounting
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SOX Act”) addressed, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information, and penalties for non-compliance. Generally the SOX Act, among other matters, (i) requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the accuracy and completeness of periodic reports filed with the SEC, and to certain matters relating to disclosure and accounting controls at public companies; (ii) imposes specific and enhanced corporate disclosure requirements; (iii) accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies; and (iv) requires companies to adopt and disclose information about corporate governance practices.
 
As a public reporting company with the SEC, we are subject to the requirements of the SOX Act and related rules and regulations issued by the SEC and NASDAQ.

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism
 
The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act of 2001 
 
The Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”) requires all financial institutions to (among other requirements) establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA also sets forth various recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as reporting suspicious activities that may signal criminal activity), and certain due diligence and "know your customer" documentation requirements. These requirements have been expanded, and banks are now required to establish and maintain written procedures that are designed to identify and verify beneficial owners of legal entity customers.
 
Further, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, intended to combat terrorism, was renewed with certain amendments in 2006 (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act, in relevant part, (i) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; (ii) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; (iii) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money-laundering compliance program; and (iv) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. The Patriot Act also includes provisions providing the government with power to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to bank account records. Regulators are directed to consider a bank holding company’s and a bank’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing and ruling on applications under the BHC Act and the Bank Merger Act. The Holding Company and the Bank have established compliance programs designed to comply with the requirements of the BSA and Patriot Acts.
 
Financial Services Modernization
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) brought about significant changes to the laws affecting banks and bank holding companies. Generally, the GLBA (i) repealed historical restrictions on preventing banks from affiliating with securities firms; (ii) provided a uniform framework for the activities of banks, savings institutions and their holding companies; (iii) broadened the activities that may be conducted by national banks and banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies; (iv) provided an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumer information and requires notification to consumers of bank privacy policies; and (v) addressed a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day-to-day operations and long-term activities of financial institutions. The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require a bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of the bank’s information sharing practices and their right to opt out of certain practices.
The Dodd-Frank Act
 
General
 
The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July of 2010. It significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Holding Company and the Bank. Some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that impact us are summarized below.
Corporate Governance
 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to provide their shareholders with (i) a non-binding shareholder vote on executive compensation, (ii) a non-binding shareholder vote on the frequency of such vote, (iii) disclosure of “golden parachute” arrangements in connection with specified change in control transactions, and (iv) a non-binding shareholder vote on golden parachute arrangements in connection with these change in control transactions. In 2015, the SEC adopted a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that requires a public company to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") to the median compensation of its employees. This rule is intended to provide shareholders with information that they can use to evaluate a CEO's compensation.
Prohibition Against Charter Conversions of Troubled Institutions
 
The Dodd-Frank Act generally prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to federal charter, or vice versa, while it is the subject to an enforcement action unless the depository institution seeks prior approval from its primary regulator and complies with specified procedures to ensure compliance with the enforcement action.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
 
The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally not subject to direct supervision and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB has issued and continues to propose and issue regulations that may increase the compliance burden of the Bank including:

● | Positions taken by the CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory which could make it more difficult for lenders to charge different rates or to apply different terms to loans to different customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The CFPB’s final rule amending Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring most lenders to report expanded information in order for the CFPB to more effectively monitor fair lending concerns and other information shortcomings identified by the CFPB.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Positions taken by the CFPB regarding the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, which require companies to obtain consumer authorizations before automatically debiting a consumer’s account for pre-authorized electronic funds transfers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focused efforts on enforcing certain compliance obligations the CFPB deems a priority, such as automobile and student loan servicing, debt collection, mortgage origination and servicing, remittances, and fair lending, among others.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeal of Demand Deposit Interest Prohibition
 
The Dodd-Frank Act repealed federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
Board Composition
 
In 2018, the California “Women on Boards” bill was signed into law to advance equitable gender representation on certain California corporate boards. California is the first state in the nation to require all publicly-held domestic or foreign corporations whose principal executive offices are located in California to have at least one female director on their boards by December 31, 2019. Based on the size of our board, we will be required to have three women directors as of December 31, 2021. We had one female serving on our board as of December 31, 2020, and in support of equitable gender representation we will be adding two additional female directors to our board in 2021.
 
In 2020, California’s Assembly Bill (“AB”) 979 was signed into law to increase diversity to California corporate boards. The bill requires public companies to have at least one director who is from an underrepresented community on their board by December 31, 2021 and, for companies with nine or more directors, to have a minimum of three directors from underrepresented communities on the board by December 31, 2022. The bill defines members of underrepresented communities to include those who self-identify as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native, or as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. We strive to be a diverse and inclusive company, and we intend to add additional directors from underrepresented communities to our board in accordance with this bill.
 
Recent and Proposed Legislation
 
The economic and political environment in recent years has led to a number of proposed legislative, governmental and regulatory initiatives that may significantly impact the banking industry. We cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact of any such initiatives on our operations, competitive situation, financial condition, or results of operations. Past history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations typically result in a greater compliance burden which increases the general cost of doing business. The new administration under President Biden has expressed a general intent to regulate the financial services industry more strictly than the administration of his predecessor.
COVID-19 Legislation and Regulation
 
Governments at the federal, state, and local levels continue to take steps to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 27, 2020, the historic $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law, which included $350 billion in stimulus for small businesses under the so-called “Paycheck Protection Program,” along with direct stimulus payments (i.e., “economic impact payments” or “stimulus checks”) for many eligible Americans. The initial amounts available under the Paycheck Protection Program were quickly exhausted in less than two weeks, which prompted Congress to allocate additional funding. On April 24, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enforcement Act was signed into law to replenish funding to the Paycheck Protection Program and to provide other spending for hospitals and virus testing. Further, on July 3, 2020, the President extended the deadline for potential borrowers to apply for Paycheck Protection Program funds until August 8, 2020. And recently, on December 21, 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law by the President on December 27th, and included another $284 billion to fund an expansion of the Paycheck Protection Program, subject to certain changes in eligibility requirements and program design. During 2020, the Bank funded 606 PPP loans totaling $163.5 million. The Bank is currently taking additional loan applications, and making new loans, under the program, as most recently updated. The legislative and regulatory landscape surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic continues to change, and neither the Holding Company nor the Bank can predict with certainty the impact it will have on our operations or business.

Deposit Insurance
 
FDIC Insured Deposits
 
The Bank’s deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, up to the maximum applicable limits and are subject to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC, which are designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. The Dodd-Frank Act redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments by requiring the FDIC to determine assessments based on assets instead of deposits. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. The FDIC may also prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the Depositors Insurance Fund.
Safety and Soundness
 
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
 
The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased FDIC deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.
