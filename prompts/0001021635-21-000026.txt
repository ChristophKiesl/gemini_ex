Item 1. Business.
Introduction

OGE Energy, incorporated in August 1995 in the State of Oklahoma, is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central U.S. OGE Energy conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. 

OG&E. OGE Energy's electric utility operations are conducted through OG&E, which generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. OG&E's rates are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OGE Energy. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. 
Enable. OGE Energy's natural gas midstream operations segment represents OGE Energy's investment in Enable. The investment in Enable is held through wholly-owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. Enable is primarily engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable also owns crude oil gathering assets in the Anadarko and Williston Basins. Enable has intrastate natural gas transportation and storage assets that are located in Oklahoma as well as interstate assets that extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Louisiana, from Louisiana to Illinois and from Louisiana to Alabama. At December 31, 2020, OGE Energy owned 111.0 million common units, or 25.5 percent, of Enable's outstanding common units.
On February 16, 2021, Enable entered into a definitive merger agreement with Energy Transfer, pursuant to which, and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, all outstanding common units of Enable will be acquired by Energy Transfer in an all-equity transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Enable's common unitholders, including OGE Energy, will receive 0.8595 of one common unit representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer for each common unit of Enable. The transaction is anticipated to close in 2021. The transaction is subject to the receipt of the required approvals from the holders of a majority of Enable's common units, anti-trust approvals and other customary closing conditions. Assuming the transaction closes, OGE Energy will own approximately three percent of Energy Transfer's outstanding limited partner units in lieu of the 25.5 percent interest in Enable that it currently owns. Energy Transfer owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the U.S., with a strategic footprint in all of the major domestic production basins. Energy Transfer is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations that include complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets; crude oil, NGL and refined product transportation and terminalling assets; NGL fractionation; and various acquisition and marketing assets. 
See "Enable's Pending Merger with Energy Transfer" within "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of risks related to the Enable and Energy Transfer merger.

Electric Operations - OG&E
General
OG&E furnishes retail electric service in 267 communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas. The service area covers 30,000 square miles in Oklahoma and western Arkansas, including Oklahoma City, the largest city in Oklahoma, and Fort Smith, Arkansas, the second largest city in that state. Of the 267 communities that OG&E serves, 241 are located in Oklahoma, and 26 are in Arkansas. OG&E derived 92 percent of its total electric operating revenues in 2020 from sales in Oklahoma and the remainder from sales in Arkansas. OG&E does not currently serve wholesale customers in either state. 
OG&E's system control area peak demand in 2020 was 6,437 MWs on August 28, 2020. OG&E's load responsibility peak demand was 5,711 MWs on August 28, 2020. The following table presents system sales and variations in system sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Year Ended December 31 | 2020 | 2020 vs. 2019 | 2019 | 2019 vs. 2018 | 2018
System sales (Millions of MWh) | 27.0 | (4.9)% | 28.4 | 1.1% | 28.1

OG&E is subject to competition in various degrees from government-owned electric systems, municipally-owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from other private utilities, power marketers and cogenerators. Oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity.
Besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity, OG&E competes with suppliers of other forms of energy. The degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy. It is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production. OG&E's ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinant of its competitiveness.

Regulation and Rates
OG&E's retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas. The issuance of certain securities by OG&E is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC. OG&E's transmission activities, short-term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OG&E's facilities and operations. In 2020, 86 percent of OG&E's electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, eight percent to the APSC and six percent to the FERC.
The OCC and the APSC require that, among other things, (i) OGE Energy permits the OCC and the APSC access to the books and records of OGE Energy and its affiliates relating to transactions with OG&E; (ii) OGE Energy employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non-utility activities by OG&E's customers; and (iii) OGE Energy refrain from pledging OG&E assets or income for affiliate transactions. In addition, the FERC has access to the books and records of OGE Energy and its affiliates as the FERC deems relevant to costs incurred by OG&E or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers with respect to the FERC jurisdictional rates. 
For information concerning OG&E's recently completed and currently pending regulatory proceedings, see Note 16 within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
OG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.
OG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. Management continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets. When in management's judgment future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory asset is adjusted, as appropriate. If OG&E were required to discontinue the application of accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities for some or all of its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets or liabilities, which could have significant financial effects. See Note 1 within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of OG&E's regulatory assets and liabilities. 
Rate Structures
Oklahoma 
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus a fuel adjustment clause mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power.
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options, as described below.
•Under OG&E's Smart Grid-enabled SmartHours programs, "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" rates offer customers the ability to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity is lowest. 
•The guaranteed flat bill option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set monthly price for an entire year. 
•The Renewable Energy Credit purchase program, a rate option that provides a "renewable energy" resource, is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind and solar resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of OG&E's conservation-minded customers. 
•Load Reduction is a voluntary load curtailment program that provides OG&E's commercial and industrial customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action. Customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response. This voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required. 
•OG&E offers certain qualifying customers "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options which allow participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on price signals received from OG&E. The prices for the "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options are based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs. 
OG&E has Public Schools-Demand and Public Schools Non-Demand rate classes that provide OG&E with flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public schools and their unique usage patterns. OG&E also provides service level, seasonal and time period fuel charge differentiation that allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect the underlying costs of providing electric service. Lastly, OG&E has a military base rider that demonstrates Oklahoma's continued commitment to our military partners. 
The previously discussed rate options, coupled with OG&E's other rate choices, provide many tariff options for OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. The revenue impacts associated with these options are not determinable in future years because customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the alternative rate option choices. Revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers' usage characteristics if they choose alternative rate options.
Arkansas 
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus an energy cost recovery mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. OG&E's current rate order from the APSC includes a formula rate rider that provides for an annual adjustment to rates if the earned rate of return falls outside of a plus or minus 50 basis point dead-band around the allowed return on equity. Adjustments are limited to plus or minus four percent of revenue for each rate class for the 12 months preceding the test period. The initial term for the formula rate rider is not to exceed five years from the date of the APSC final order in the last general rate review, May 18, 2017, unless additional approval is obtained from the APSC. 
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options, as described below.
•The "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" tariffs allow participating customers to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity is lowest. 
•The Renewable Energy Credit purchase program, a tariff rate option that provides a "renewable energy" resource, is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&E's Arkansas retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers. 
•Load Reduction is a voluntary load curtailment program that provides OG&E's commercial and industrial customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis and receive a billing credit when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action. 
•OG&E offers certain qualifying customers a "day-ahead price" rate option which allows participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on a price signal received from OG&E. The "day-ahead price" is based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs. 
Fuel Supply and Generation 
The following table presents the OG&E-generated energy produced and the weighted average cost of fuel used, by type, for the last three years. 

 | Fuel Mix (A) | Fuel Cost (In cents/Kilowatt-Hour)
 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 
Natural gas | 66% | 64% | 48% | 2.077 | 2.188 | 2.517
Coal | 26% | 28% | 45% | 1.821 | 2.029 | 2.025
Renewable | 8% | 8% | 7% | — | — | — 
Total fuel | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1.863 | 1.970 | 2.119

(A)Fuel mix calculated as a percent of net MWhs generated. 
The decreases in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2019 compared to 2018 were primarily due to lower fuel prices year over year. These fuel costs are recovered through OG&E's fuel adjustment clauses that are approved by the OCC and the APSC.
OG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness within the SPP area. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses.
Of OG&E's 7,120 total MWs of generation capability reflected in the table within "Item 2. Properties," 4,795 MWs, or 67.4 percent, are from natural gas generation, 1,534 MWs, or 21.5 percent, are from coal generation, 320 MWs, or 4.5 percent, are from dual-fuel generation (coal/gas), 449 MWs, or 6.3 percent, are from wind generation and 22 MWs, or 0.3 percent, are from solar generation. 
Natural Gas
As a participant in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, OG&E purchases its natural gas supply through short-term agreements. OG&E relies on a combination of natural gas base load agreements and call agreements, whereby OG&E has the right but not the obligation to purchase a defined quantity of natural gas, combined with day and intra-day purchases to meet the demands of the SPP Integrated Marketplace. 
Coal
OG&E's coal-fired units are designed to burn primarily low sulfur western sub-bituminous coal. The combination of all 2020 coal purchased had a weighted average sulfur content of 0.2 percent. Based on the average sulfur content and EPA-certified data, OG&E's coal units have an approximate emission rate of 0.1 lbs. of SO2 per MMBtu. 
For the first two quarters of 2021, OG&E has coal supply agreements for 100 percent of its coal requirements for the Sooner, Muskogee and River Valley facilities. OG&E plans to fill the remainder of its 2021 coal needs through additional term agreements, spot purchases and the use of existing inventory. OG&E has no coal agreements beyond June 2021. In 2020, OG&E purchased 2.518 million tons of coal from its Wyoming supplier and 0.027 million tons from its Oklahoma supplier. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations" within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of environmental matters which may affect OG&E in the future, including its utilization of coal.
Wind
OG&E owns the 120 MW Centennial, 101 MW OU Spirit and 228 MW Crossroads wind farms. OG&E's current wind power portfolio also includes purchased power contracts as presented in the following table. 

Company | Location | Original Term of Contract | Expiration of Contract | MWs 
CPV Keenan | Woodward County, OK | 20 years | 2030 | 152.0
Edison Mission Energy | Dewey County, OK | 20 years | 2031 | 130.0
NextEra Energy | Blackwell, OK | 20 years | 2032 | 60.0 

Solar 
OG&E currently owns and operates, or will operate, the solar farms presented in the following table.

Name | Location | Year Completed | Photovoltaic Panels | MWs
Mustang | Oklahoma City, OK | 2015 | 9,867 | 2.5
Covington | Covington, OK | 2018 | 38,000 | 9.7
Choctaw Nation | Durant, OK | 2020 | 15,344 | 5.0
Chickasaw Nation | Davis, OK | 2020 | 15,344 | 5.0
Branch | Branch, AR | In progress | 15,444 | 5.0

OG&E will continue to evaluate the need to add additional solar sites to its generation portfolio based on customer demand, cost and reliability. 
Safety and Health Regulation

OG&E is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, the EPA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the safety and health of workers.
In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials stored, used or produced in OG&E's operations and that this information be provided or made available to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. OG&E believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health. 
Natural Gas Midstream Operations - Enable
Overview

Enable is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership that owns, operates and develops strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets. Enable serves current and emerging production areas in the U.S., including several unconventional shale resource plays and local and regional end-user markets in the U.S. Enable's assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i) gathering and processing and (ii) transportation and storage. Enable's gathering and processing segment primarily provides natural gas gathering and processing to its producer customers and crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering services to its producer and refiner customers. Enable's transportation and storage segment provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to its producer, power plant, LDC and industrial end-user customers.
Gathering and Processing
Enable owns and operates substantial natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering assets primarily in five states. Enable's gathering and processing operations consist primarily of natural gas gathering and processing assets serving the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins, crude oil and condensate gathering assets serving the Anadarko Basin and crude oil and produced water gathering assets serving the Williston Basin. Enable provides a variety of services to the active producers in its operating areas, including gathering, compressing, treating and processing natural gas, fractionating NGLs and gathering crude oil, condensate and produced water. Enable serves shale and other unconventional plays in the basins in which it operates.
Enable generates revenues from producers in the basins in which it operates. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Enable's top ten natural gas producer customers accounted for approximately 70 percent of its natural gas gathered volumes. Enable's Anadarko Basin crude oil gathering system gathers crude oil and condensate from producers, which are primarily delivered to one customer. The rates and terms of service on Enable's Anadarko Basin crude oil and condensate gathering systems are regulated by the OCC. Enable's Williston Basin crude oil and produced water gathering systems serve one customer. The rates and terms of service on Enable's Williston Basin crude oil gathering systems, but not its produced water gathering systems, are regulated by the FERC. Enable's contracts typically provide for crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering services that are fee-based, for natural gas gathering services that are fee-based and for natural gas processing arrangements that are fee-based, or percent-of-liquids, percent-of-proceeds or keep-whole based. 
Competition for Enable's gathering and processing systems is primarily a function of gathering rate, processing value, system reliability, fuel rate, system run time, construction cycle time and prices at the wellhead. Enable's gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities. In the process of selling NGLs, Enable competes against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs. Enable's primary competitors are other midstream companies who are active in the regions where Enable operates.
While the results of Enable's gathering and processing segment are not materially affected by seasonality, from time to time, its operations and construction of assets can be impacted by inclement weather.
Transportation and Storage
Enable owns and operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage systems primarily across nine states. Enable's transportation and storage systems consist primarily of its interstate systems, EGT and MRT, its intrastate system, EOIT, and its investment in SESH. Enable's transportation and storage assets transport natural gas from areas of production and interconnected pipelines to power plants, LDCs and industrial end users as well as interconnected pipelines for delivery to additional markets. Enable's transportation and storage assets also provide facilities where natural gas can be stored by customers.
Enable's interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage systems generate revenue primarily by serving large natural gas and electric utilities, as well as natural gas producers, industrial end-users and natural gas marketers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 28 percent of EGT's service revenue was attributable to contracts with one customer, CenterPoint. As of December 31, 2020, EGT's transportation contracts representing three percent, eight percent and 89 percent of CenterPoint's firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in 2021, 2024 and 2030, respectively. EGT's firm storage contracts representing 33 percent and 67 percent of CenterPoint's firm storage capacity are scheduled to expire in 2021 and 2030, respectively. 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 63 percent of MRT's service revenue was attributable to contracts with one customer, Spire Inc. MRT's firm transportation contracts representing 63 percent, 24 percent and 12 percent of Spire Inc.'s firm transportation capacity are scheduled to expire in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. All of Spire Inc.'s firm storage contracts are scheduled to expire in 2024.
Enable's EGT, MRT and SESH transportation and storage services are typically provided under firm, fee-based transportation and storage agreements, with rates and terms of service regulated by the FERC. EOIT provides fee-based firm and interruptible transportation and storage services on both an intrastate and interstate basis.
Enable's interstate and intrastate pipelines compete with a variety of other interstate and intrastate pipelines in providing transportation and storage services within its operating areas. Enable's management views the principal elements of competition for their natural gas transportation and storage systems primarily as a function of rates, terms of services, flexibility and reliability.
Customer demand for natural gas transportation and storage services on EGT and MRT is usually higher during the winter, primarily due to LDC demand to serve residential and commercial natural gas requirements. Customer demand for natural gas transportation and storage services on EOIT and SESH is usually higher during the summer, primarily due to electric utility demand for natural gas.
Environmental Matters

General

The activities of the Registrants are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact the Registrants' business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions or pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Management believes that all of the Registrants' operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards. 

In the past, environmental regulation caused the Registrants to incur significant costs because the trend was to place more and more restrictions and limitations on the Registrants' activities. Under the Trump administration, the trend in environmental regulation was to delay, reverse or repeal some of these restrictions and generally not to adopt new, more stringent regulations. The Biden administration has announced that it plans to reverse many of the Trump administration's environmental policies, including issuance of an executive order that instructs the EPA and other executive agencies to review certain rules that affect the Registrants. The Registrants are monitoring these actions in an effort to understand the likely stringency of future rules. In the meantime, the Registrants continue to have obligations to take or complete action under current environmental rules. 
Management continues to evaluate the Registrants' compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market but at the current time, based on existing rules, does not expect capital expenditures for environmental control facilities to be material for 2021 or 2022. For further discussion of environmental matters and capital expenditures related to environmental factors that may affect the Registrants, see "2020 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities," "Future Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Laws and Regulations" within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Human Capital Management
Our company fulfills a critical role in the nation's electric utility and, through our equity investment in Enable, natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure. In order to do so, we believe we need to attract, retain and develop a high quality, diverse workforce and create a safe, inclusive and productive work environment for everyone. We believe that our company's core values and beliefs, including those of respect, diversity and inclusion, and safety, serve as a foundation for our relationships with our employees, who we refer to internally as "members" of the Registrants. These core values and beliefs are reinforced to all employees at the time of hire, annually through a review of our Code of Ethics and periodically through small and large group meetings. At December 31, 2020, OGE Energy had 2,360 employees, of which 1,872 are OG&E employees. 
To help us attract and retain the most qualified individuals for our businesses, we provide a combination of strong compensation and health and welfare benefit offerings, growth and development opportunities and various retirement plan options. Our employees are also offered paid volunteer leave every year, which is intended to further enrich both their lives and the lives in the communities we serve. Many of the positions in our companies are highly specialized, so having appropriate training and succession planning is critical to business continuity and competitiveness. We provide leadership and career development opportunities, including internal and external training as well as tuition reimbursement, to invest in the next generation of leaders for our company. We target an average of 30-35 hours of training per employee annually, which aligns with the benchmark published annually by the American Society of Training and Development. This comprehensive investment in our employees contributes to an average tenure of 15 years and a voluntary turnover rate of 5.7 percent for 2020, which is 0.5 percent lower than the average voluntary turnover rate compared to our industry benchmark (the PwC Saratoga Benchmarking Service). 
Employee safety is paramount in the work we perform. One of our company core beliefs is to "Live Safely," which to us means that we protect ourselves and others from injury by constant engagement, "always living safely." Our goal is to have zero safety incidents every year, and we educate all of our employees on our incident and injury free workplace vision. We report and analyze all near misses and incidents to understand the causal factors and associated corrective actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of reoccurrence. We share what we have learned company-wide to provide real-time learning opportunities for all employees. We track our safety performance and benchmark ourselves to our peer group, the Southeast Electric Exchange. For 2020, our Southeast Electric Exchange incident rate was 0.47, which represented a 40 percent improvement from our 2019 performance. The incident rate is calculated by counting the actual number of injuries and illnesses per 100 employees' standard base labor hours divided by the actual number of hours employees worked. In comparison to our peer group, our five year average safety performance placed us in the top quartile. We continue to analyze trends and engage in discussions with our employees, creating a dialogue to enhance safety performance and work towards our incident and injury-free workplace. Further discussion of the steps we are taking to help ensure employee safety during the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis – Recent Developments – COVID-19." 
We also strive to reinforce the belief that our employees are one of our greatest assets by creating a culture of respect throughout the company. We do this by, among other things, encouraging employees to treat others justly and considering their views in the decisions we make. We believe diversity and inclusion means embracing the uniqueness of each individual to make us a stronger and more resourceful organization while serving and supporting the diverse communities where we live and work. We are focused on creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce, particularly related to minority hiring. We have formed relationships with diverse high schools in our service territory to introduce their students to potential jobs in the energy industry and career paths to OGE Energy and have worked with technical schools to recruit diverse students to their programs, which can lead to potential employment for our operational positions. We have also formed relationships with universities to provide scholarships to students with diverse backgrounds. Additionally, we have focused on hiring individuals transitioning out of the military. We are also focused on the inclusion of women in leadership positions. For example, female representation among our officers and management-level directors is currently at 27 percent, which is up eight percent compared to five years ago. As some of our more tenured employees retire (we average approximately 85 to 90 retirements, or four percent of our workforce, per year), opportunities are created to promote or attract and hire additional individuals with diverse backgrounds. 
Another initiative intended to promote inclusion and member development is the establishment of Employee Resource Groups at the company, and our newly appointed Director of Ethics, Equity, and Inclusion is leading this effort.
