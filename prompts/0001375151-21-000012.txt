ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Zogenix Inc. is a global biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing therapies with the potential to transform the lives of patients and their families living with rare diseases. We are primarily focused on developing and commercializing two therapeutic product opportunities: Fintepla, a low-dose fenfluramine, for rare, devastating, difficult-to-treat pediatric epilepsy disorders and MT1621 for a rare, life-threatening mitochondrial depletion disease, thymidine kinase 2 deficiency (TK2d).
Fintepla is approved for marketing in the U.S., the European Union (EU) and in the United Kingdom and is under late-stage development in Japan for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, a rare and devastating pediatric epilepsy disorder. 
We own and control worldwide development and commercialization rights to Fintepla. We currently market and commercialize Fintepla in the U.S. through our own highly specialized and focused commercial team. In February 2021, we launched Fintepla in our first market in Europe, Germany, through a similarly specialized commercial team and plan to utilize this self-commercialization strategy throughout major markets in Europe. In March 2019, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. to support the sales and distribution of Fintepla in Japan, if approved for marketing in that country. We plan to seek regulatory approvals and make Fintepla available to patients in other select international markets through our commercial team or work with partners in other parts of the world. Fintepla is also under late-stage development for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), another rare and devastating form of childhood-onset epilepsy. Additionally, we plan to initiate studies for Fintepla in other rare epileptic syndromes and diseases, including CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), which we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2021, and in multiple other epilepsy disorders through on-going and new Investigator Initiated Studies.
In September 2019, we acquired all the outstanding equity interests of Modis Therapeutics, Inc. (Modis), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company. Through our Modis acquisition, we hold exclusive worldwide license from Columbia University in New York City (Columbia) to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Columbia to develop and commercialize MT1621. MT1621 is an investigational deoxynucleoside-combination substrate enhancement therapy in development for the treatment of TK2d, an inherited mitochondrial DNA depletion disease that predominantly affects children and is often fatal. MT1621 is currently in late-stage development and we are in active discussions with regulatory authorities in the U.S. and in Europe regarding the potential submission of new drug applications (NDAs) for MT1621 as a treatment for patients with TK2d. 
Our Strategy
Our mission is to develop and commercialize therapies with the potential to transform the lives of patients and their families living with rare diseases. The critical components of our business strategy include the following:
•Successfully launch and commercialize Fintepla for the treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome in the U.S. and Europe, and obtain regulatory approval and commence commercialization in Japan and multiple select geographies throughout the world. In June 2020, we announced FDA approval for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in the U.S. Shortly thereafter, in July 2021 we launched Fintepla and made the therapy available to patients in the U.S. through our specialized commercial team, including our care coordination team at Zogenix Central. In December, 2020, we received marketing approval for Fintepla for the treatment of seizures in Dravet syndrome from the European Commission and we launched Fintepla in our first market in Europe, Germany, in February 2021 through a highly focused commercial team. We plan to launch and commercialize Fintepla in other major European markets with similarly focused country-based commercial teams once we are able to secure appropriate reimbursement approvals. In Japan, we are pursuing regulatory approval for Fintepla with our commercial partner, Nippon Shinyaku, and will seek to make Fintepla available to patients in other select international markets through our own commercial teams or partnerships. We have entered into manufacturing and supply agreements for Fintepla and are continuing to build our internal commercial capabilities for potential commercialization in other select international markets.
•Seek regulatory approval of Fintepla for the treatment of LGS. In February 2020, we reported positive top-line results from our global Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 1601) of Fintepla for the treatment of LGS. The trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day was statistically 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 4


superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of drop seizures and demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in key secondary efficacy measures, including the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% in drop seizure frequency. We plan to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for LGS with the FDA in the second half of 2021 and subsequently submit an application for a Type II Variation Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for an additional LGS indication in Europe. Subject to obtaining approvals, we plan to commercialize Fintepla as a potential treatment for patients with LGS in the U.S. and Europe with a similar self-commercialization approach that we are taking in Dravet syndrome.
•Advance the development of MT1621 for the treatment of TK2d. In October 2019, we announced positive top-line results from our global, retrospective Phase 2 study (the RETRO study) at the World Muscle Society congress in Copenhagen. 94.7% of treated patients had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) overall responses in major functional domains. A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was statistically significant (p<0.0006). Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones such as ambulation, respiratory function and feeding. Safety data from RETRO indicated that MT1621 was generally well-tolerated. We held several meetings with the FDA and EMA in 2020 to discuss regulatory requirements and the scope of information needed for NDA and MAA submissions, respectively. Based on the feedback received from the FDA, we expect availability of all required data by the end of 2021 to support an NDA submission, which we are targeting for mid-2022. We anticipate submitting an MAA to obtain marketing authorization in Europe shortly thereafter.
•Pursue development of Fintepla for additional indications. In addition to Dravet syndrome and LGS, we believe that the unique mechanism of action of Fintepla has the potential to treat other serious epileptic encephalopathies where there is a significant unmet medical need. In January 2021 we announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 trial of Fintepla for the treatment of CDD, an infant-onset genetic seizure disorder in 2021. We also plan to continue to explore Fintepla as a potential treatment for additional severe, treatment-resistant rare epilepsies through the initiation of other company-sponsored clinical studies in addition to ongoing Investigator Initiated Studies being conducted in Sunflower Syndrome, CDD and Doose syndrome.
Commercial Product
Fintepla for Patients with Dravet Syndrome
Fintepla is a low-dose, oral solution formulation of fenfluramine, a small molecule with unique serotonergic and positive sigma-1 receptor modulation activity, approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. To ensure safe use, Fintepla was approved to be available in the U.S. only through a restricted program called the Fintepla REMS. Under the Fintepla REMS program, echocardiogram assessments of patients are required before, during, and after treatment with Fintepla. Fintepla is approved in Europe for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients two years of age and older and is available via a controlled access program. 
In support of the approvals, Fintepla demonstrated positive safety and efficacy results from two randomized, international, multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials (Study 1 and Study 2), as well as data from a long-term, open-label extension study in 330 Dravet syndrome patients treated up to 3 years. The Study 1 trial met its primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day (26 mg/day maximum), is superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 14-week treatment period (p<0.001). The Study 2 trial successfully met the primary objective of demonstrating that Fintepla, at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day, when co-administered with the stiripentol regimen, was superior to placebo as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children and young adults based on change in the frequency of convulsive seizures between the 6-week baseline observation period and the 15-week treatment period (p<0.001). Across both Study 1 and Study 2, Fintepla was generally well-tolerated and no case of valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension was observed in any patients.
Dravet syndrome is a rare, lifelong form of pediatric-onset epilepsy, marked with severe, debilitating seizures with life threatening consequences for patients and for which current treatment options are limited. The exact number of people with Dravet syndrome is unknown but has been estimated to be between 1 in 15,700 to 1 in 40,000 people.

Our Clinical Product Candidates 
Fintepla for Patients with LGS
 LGS is another rare, refractory, debilitating pediatric-onset epilepsy with life threatening consequences for patients and for which current treatment options are limited and suboptimal.
In November 2017 we announced the initiation of our multicenter global Phase 3 clinical trial of Fintepla as an adjunctive treatment for seizures in patients with LGS (Study 1601). The study included a total of 263 patients between the ages of 2 and 35 years whose seizures were currently uncontrolled while on one or more anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) randomized into three treatment groups: Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day (26 mg maximum daily dose; n=87), Fintepla 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89), and placebo (n=87). The median age of patients was 13 years, with 29% being 18 years or older. Patients entering the study were taking between one and four AEDs and previously had tried and discontinued an average of seven other AEDs. The median baseline drop seizure frequency across the study groups was 77 seizures per month. After establishing baseline seizure frequency for 4 weeks, randomized patients were titrated to their dose over a 2-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose maintenance period. Patients who completed Part 1 were eligible to enter Part 2 of the clinical trial, an ongoing 12-month open label extension (OLE) study to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and effectiveness of Fintepla. 
Study 1601 met its primary endpoint of showing a highly statistically significant reduction from baseline compared to placebo in the median percent change in monthly drop seizure frequency. Patients taking Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction of 26.5% compared to a median reduction of 7.8% in patients taking placebo (p=0.0012). Using a parametric analysis, patients taking Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day demonstrated a 26.5% greater reduction in mean monthly drop seizure frequency compared to placebo (p=0.0034). The median percent reduction in monthly drop seizures between baseline and the treatment period for the lower study dose of Fintepla (0.2 mg/kg/day), a secondary endpoint, was 13.2% and did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo (p=0.0915). Additional secondary endpoints of the study were also positive as the proportion of study patients treated with Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day who achieved a (≥50%) reduction in monthly drop seizures was superior to placebo (p=0.0165). Also, with regard to Clinical Global Impression of Improvement ratings (CGI-I, a measure of improvement of worsening relative to baseline) as assessed by the investigator, patients who received the Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day dose demonstrated a superiority to placebo in terms of the proportion of patients who much improved or very much improved (p=0.0007).
In Study 1601 Fintepla was generally well-tolerated, with the adverse events consistent with those observed in our two prior Phase 3 trials in Dravet syndrome. incidence of patients who experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event was 89.7% of patients in the Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day group, 76.4% in the Fintepla 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 79.3% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events (≥10%) in the Fintepla-treated groups were decreased appetite, somnolence, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and pyrexia. The incidence of serious treatment emergent adverse events was 11.5% (n=10) in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group, 4.5% (n=4) in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group, and 4.6% (n=4) in the placebo group. Six patients in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group had an adverse event leading to study discontinuation compared to four subjects in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group and one patient in the placebo group; the majority of these were considered treatment-related. There was one death during the trial (0.7 mg/kg/day group) caused by SUDEP, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug. No cases of valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension have been observed in Study 1601. A total of 247 (93.9%) patients entered the OLE phase. 
We plan to submit a sNDA for LGS with the FDA in the second half of 2021 and subsequently submit an application for a Type II Variation MAA for an additional LGS indication in Europe.
Fintepla for Other Potential Indications 
In addition to Dravet syndrome and LGS, we plan to investigate the treatment potential of Fintepla in other serious, treatment-resistant epileptic syndromes. In January 2021, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 3 trial in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a genetic neurological disorder that presents clinically with persistent seizures starting at infancy, followed by severe motor impairment in neurological development. In December, 2020 at the annual American Epilepsy Society Meeting, clinical investigators from the New York University Lagone Medical Center reported interim results from the first six patients of an open-label, investigator-initiated study of Fintepla in CDD patients between ages 2 and 35 that patients taking Fintepla at a dose of up to 0.7/mg/kg day experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in both generalized clonic-tonic seizures (90%) and tonic seizures (55%). We expect to enroll the first patient in our Phase 3 trial to evaluate whether Fintepla is safe and effective versus placebo in CDD patients in the second half of 2021.
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6


In addition to this planned study in CDD patients, we also plan to continue to explore Fintepla as a potential treatment for additional severe, treatment-resistant rare epilepsies through the initiation of other company-sponsored clinical studies in addition to ongoing Investigator Initiated Studies being conducted in Sunflower Syndrome and Doose syndrome.
MT1621 for Patients with TK2d
TK2d is a rare, debilitating, and often fatal genetic disorder that primarily affects infants and children and for which there are currently no approved therapies. As of September 6, 2019, the date we acquired Modis, Modis had completed the RETRO study of MT1621 in patients with TK2d and commenced a Phase 2 prospective, OLE study of patients with TK2d, Study MT1621-101. MT1621 has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA and access to the PRIME scheme by the EMA and we intend to seek accelerated regulatory review pathways in both the United States and Europe.
RETRO was a global retrospective study of MT1621, a fixed combination treatment of two pyrimidine nucleosides deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine (dC/dT), in 38 pediatric and adult patients with TK2d (median age of disease onset, 2.5 years) treated at eight clinical sites in the United States, Spain and Israel.
Subjects received MT1621 for a median of 71 weeks (range 92 days – 7 years). Each subject was scored across motor, respiratory, and feeding domains according to pre-defined response criteria and was compared to pre-treatment status to assess whether responses improved, remained stable, or worsened. Parallel to RETRO, we compiled a comprehensive, global TK2d Natural History dataset from published studies and individual case reports to document untreated patients’ disease course. From this natural history dataset, 68 patients reflecting the range of disease severity, age, and age of disease onset, were selected as a control group for treated patients in the RETRO study.
In October 2019 we announced positive top-line results from the pivotal Phase 2 RETRO study at the World Muscle Society congress in Copenhagen. 94.7% of treated patients had either improved (68%) or stabilized (26%) overall responses in major functional domains. A survival analysis using a time-dependent Cox regression model showed that the difference in probability of survival between treated patients and untreated natural history control patients was statistically significant (p<0.0006). Among clinical responders, a subset demonstrated profound responses, in some cases re-acquiring previously lost motor milestones such as ambulation, respiratory function and feeding. Safety data from RETRO indicated that MT1621 was generally well-tolerated. Most reported adverse events were considered not related to study drug (199 of 292), with mild or moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event (AE), occurring in 63% of patients. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 14 subjects (37%). The majority of SAEs were deemed related to TK2d; two patients experienced three events related to study drug alone (kidney stone, kidney stone removal, diarrhea). Two adult-onset patients stopped treatment due to asymptomatic increases in aminotransferase liver enzymes (no increase in bilirubin levels), which resolved upon discontinuation of treatment. 
In April 2020, we held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and in June 2020, we met with the FDA to discuss chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) for MT1621. In the meetings, the FDA outlined the additional clinical and non-clinical information needed for an NDA submission. Based on the feedback, we expect availability of all required data by end of 2021 to support an NDA submission, which we are targeting for mid-2022. Also, in the meeting, the FDA requested we include additional information on treated patients who did not participate in the Modis-sponsored portion of the RETRO study in order to have a complete survival analysis for the NDA. This additional information will be collected in a non-interventional medical chart-review study. In addition, we plan to conduct a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study in renal impairment which was recommended by the FDA to provide dosing recommendations in the setting of impaired renal function and include the results in the NDA submission. The FDA also concurred with our proposed CMC plan for the prospective NDA submission. We have also had discussions with European regulators in 2020. Based on those interactions, we anticipate submitting an MAA to obtain marketing authorization in Europe after submitting an NDA in the U.S.
Preclinical Pipeline
Tevard Gene Therapy Collaboration for Genetic Epilepsies
In December 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Tevard Biosciences, Inc. for the research, development and commercialization of gene therapies for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and other epilepsy disorders. The collaboration is at the research and discovery stage and will leverage Tevard’ s pioneering and novel

t-RNA-based technology to treat genetic disorders not amenable to traditional types of gene therapies, such as Dravet Syndrome. 
Please see “Strategic and License Agreements” section for a more detailed description of the terms of our Tevard collaboration.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and differentiated therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product and product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller biopharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, research and development capabilities, sales and marketing capabilities, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and/or other resources than us. We will face competition not only in the commercialization of products, but also for the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates.
Fintepla
Prior to 2018, there were no FDA-approved treatments indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. The standard of care for the treatment of seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome usually involved a combination of the following anticonvulsant drugs: clobazam, clonazepam, levetiracetam, topiramate, valproic acid, ethosuximide and zonisamide. In June 2018, the FDA approved the first treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome, as well as LGS, GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex® (cannabidiol or CBD). Epidiolex is a liquid drug formulation of plant-derived purified CBD, which is a chemical component of the Cannabis sativa plant, more commonly known as marijuana. GW’s CBD was subsequently approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and LGS by the European Commission (as Epidyolex®) in September of 2019. Epidyolex must be prescribed with clobazam in Europe. In August 2018, the FDA approved a second treatment, Biocodex’s Diacomit® (stiripentol), for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients who are also taking clobazam. Stiripentol is approved in Europe, Canada and Japan for the treatment of Dravet syndrome when used in conjunction with valproate and clobazam.
Fintepla has a novel biological mechanism of action (selective serotonin and sigma-1 receptor activity) that, is different from the other antiepileptic drugs currently available and in clinical development in the United States and Europe for the treatment of epileptic encephalopathies like Dravet syndrome, including cannabidiol or stiripentol. Currently approved drugs have a different and distinct mechanism of action from Fintepla. 
Multiple companies are developing clinical-stage product candidates for the potential treatment of Dravet syndrome. Ovid Therapeutics, Inc. is currently evaluating its product candidate OV935, a first-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H), for the potential treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome and LGS in Phase 2 clinical trials. Additional clinical stage candidates for the treatment of Dravet syndrome include Ataluren from PTC Therapeutics (exploratory Phase 2), clemizole (Phase 2) being evaluated by Epygenix Therapeutics, Inc., Huperzine-A from Supernus Pharmaceuticals (Phase 1/2), STK-001 from Stoke Therapeutics (Phase 1), and NBI-921352 from Neurocrine Biosciences (Phase 1). 
Several other companies, including Encoded Therapeutics, Inc., Neucyte, Inc., NeuroCycle Therapeutics and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., have disclosed that they are evaluating preclinical drug candidates, including gene therapies and small molecules, for the potential treatment of Dravet syndrome.
MT1621 
Currently, we are not aware of any pharmaceutical products that have been approved for the treatment of a primary mitochondrial disease. Similarly, we are not aware of any pharmaceutical companies who are developing a pharmaceutical product candidate for the treatment of TK2d. 
Beyond TK2d, a number of pharmaceutical companies are developing clinical-staged product candidates for the potential treatment of other mitochondrial diseases, including Metro International Biotech LLC, PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Reneo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., and Wellstat Therapeutics Corp.

Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish or own any manufacturing facilities with respect to the manufacture of Fintepla, MT1621 or any future product candidates.
Fintepla
In February 2019, we entered into a master supply agreement with Aptuit (Oxford) Limited, an Evotec company (Aptuit) pursuant to which Aptuit will be our commercial manufacturer and supplier of fenfluramine hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in Fintepla. The term of the master supply agreement is five years, which term shall be automatically extended for successive two-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. Aptuit has been providing the API to us for our clinical trial material supply needs and registration batches for the past several years. In July 2019, we entered into a supply agreement (PCI Pharma Agreement) with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, trading as PCI Pharma Services (PCI Pharma), pursuant to which PCI Pharma will procure the raw materials (other than the active pharmaceutical ingredient) for, formulate, fill, test and release an oral solution of Fintepla. Pursuant to the PCI Pharma Agreement, at a specified time prior to the anticipated receipt of the first marketing authorization by a regulatory agency to market Fintepla, and then each month following such receipt, we are required to deliver a rolling forecast of our expected commercial orders, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order.
The term of the PCI Pharma Agreement is five years, which term shall be automatically extended for successive two-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. After the second anniversary of the Effective Date, either party may terminate the PCI Pharma Agreement at any time without cause following a specified notice period applicable to the respective party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement (1) upon written notice if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or other obligations under the PCI Pharma Agreement within a specified period following receipt of written notice of such breach, (2) immediately in the event of a material breach of the other party’s representations, warranties or other obligations under the PCI Pharma Agreement and in the event that such breach is not capable of remedy and (3) in the event that the other party files for bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, administration or receivership proceedings, or a substantial portion of the assets of such party is assigned for the benefit of such party’s creditors. We may also terminate the PCI Pharma Agreement immediately in the event PCI Pharma is unable to supply Fintepla at specified quantities and within certain times. PCI Pharma may also terminate the Agreement upon notice if it determines its performance of services would violate applicable law. PCI Pharma’s manufacturing services under the PCI Pharma Agreement will also terminate automatically if Fintepla is withdrawn as a result of regulatory review or we decide to cease development activities of Fintepla.
We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates and their component raw materials for use in our internal research efforts and clinical trials and in relation to any future commercialization of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the raw materials necessary to manufacture our product candidates. Third-party manufacturers are and will be used to formulate, fill, label, package, test, release, and distribute investigational drug products and eventually our products, if and when our product candidates receive approval. This approach allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure while enabling us to focus our expertise on developing and commercializing our product candidates. Although we believe we have multiple potential sources for the manufacture of our product candidates and their related raw materials, we currently rely on single manufacturers for different aspects of manufacturing of our products.
MT1621
As a part of our acquisition of Modis in September 2019, we assumed a manufacturing supply agreement with ST Pharm Co. LTD (ST Pharm), pursuant to which ST Pharm will be our clinical materials manufacturer and supplier of both 2’-deoxycytidine and 2’-deoxythymidine APIs used in MT1621. The term of the supply agreement is five (5) years from the date of agreement (October 2017), which term can be extended for successive two-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. ST Pharm has been providing the API for the clinical trial material supply needs and registration batches since the beginning of MT1621 clinical trials. In addition, we also assumed a supply agreement with Catalent Pharma Solutions (Catalent), pursuant to which Catalent will procure all materials other than the API, fill into drug product packs, and package, test, and release the MT1621 powder for oral solution finished product.

Strategic and License Agreements
Fintepla
In October 2014, we acquired Brabant Pharma Limited (Brabant) in a business acquisition and obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to Fintepla, one of our lead product candidates. Under the terms of the acquisition, we agreed to make future milestone payments to the former owners of Brabant for up to $95.0 million in the event we achieve certain milestones with respect to Fintepla, consisting of $50.0 million in regulatory milestones and $45.0 million in sales-based milestones. As of December 31, 2020, all regulatory milestones have been earned.
In addition, we have a collaboration and license agreement with the Universities of Antwerp and Leuven in Belgium (the Universities) that runs through September 2045. Under the terms of the agreement, the Universities granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use the data obtained from a study related to low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, as well as certain other intellectual property. We are required to pay a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome or, in the case of a sublicense of products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a percentage in the mid-twenties of the sub-licensing revenues. The agreement may be terminated by the Universities if we (a) do not use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop and commercialize products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome or related conditions stemming from infantile epilepsy, or (ii) seek approval of products containing low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in the United States; or (b) if we become insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should any petition in bankruptcy, or similar relief, be filed by or against us. We can terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to the Universities.
MT1621
As a result of our acquisition of Modis, we became party to the Exclusive License Agreement, by and between Modis and Columbia, dated as of September 26, 2016 (the Columbia Agreement), related to MT1621. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products worldwide, including to meet certain development and commercialization milestones within specified periods of time. Upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, we are required to pay Columbia up to $2.9 million and $25.0 million, respectively, as well as tiered royalties on sales for each licensed product, at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the high single-digits. The royalty obligations and Columbia Agreement will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (i) 15 years after the first bona fide commercial sale of a licensed product, (ii) the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim covering a licensed product in a country or (iii) expiration of any regulatory exclusivity covering such licensed product. The Columbia Agreement may be terminated either by Columbia or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, or by Columbia in the event we are subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. We can terminate the Columbia Agreement either in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon specified prior written notice to Columbia, provided we are not exploiting licensed products in such countries.
We also became party to a license agreement between two other research institutions related to MT1621 where we may be required to pay up to $3.0 million for research, development and regulatory milestone events and up to $10.0 million for certain sales milestone events. We are also required to pay tiered royalties ranging from low to mid-single digits on net sales of licensed product.
Tevard Collaboration, Option and License Agreement
In October 2019, we entered into an option agreement with Tevard Biosciences (Tevard), a privately-held company focused on tRNA-based gene therapies. Under the agreement, Tevard granted us an option to license exclusive rights related to a preclinical development program to identify and develop novel tRNA-based gene therapies for Dravet syndrome. During 2020, we extended the option period to exercise our license rights prior to entering into a collaboration, option and license agreement with Tevard. Payments made under the option agreement were nonrefundable, but may be credited against the upfront payment due if we exercise our option on the preclinical development program.
In December 2020, we exercised the option on the Dravet syndrome program and entered into a collaboration, option and license agreement with Tevard (the Tevard Agreement). The financial terms of the Tevard Agreement included an upfront payment of $5.2 million. In connection with the transaction, we also purchased a convertible 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10


promissory note issued by Tevard in the amount of $5.0 million. The note matures in December 2022 and carries interest at 3.5% per year. The note will automatically convert into equity securities issued by Tevard in their next equity financing transaction at a conversion price equal to the price paid per share by other investors of the financing transaction.
In addition to the upfront payments, we have agreed to fund Tevard’s early discovery activities under the licensed Dravet syndrome program in accordance with the development plan as determined by the parties to the agreement. Once Tevard completes the early discovery activities for a program, we will be responsible for any potential future development and commercialization activities. Tevard is also eligible to receive additional development, regulatory and commercial-related milestone payments of up to $100.0 million for the Dravet program, as well as tiered royalties on future net sales in the single digits that result from the collaboration. On a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, royalty payments would commence on our first commercial sale of a product and terminate on the later of: (a) the expiration of patent based exclusivity of such product in such country; (b) the expiration of regulatory based exclusivity of such product in such country; and (c) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the product in such country. Tevard has the option with respect to the Dravet syndrome program to elect to reimburse us for certain of our development costs for the Dravet syndrome program in exchange for receiving tiered royalties on future net sales ranging from low double digits to not more than 20% for products from the Dravet syndrome program.
Intellectual Property
Our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to obtain, expand and protect our intellectual property estate, enforce patents, maintain trade secret and trademark protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties.
Fintepla
As of December 31, 2020, we have rights to six issued U.S. patents and six issued foreign patents, one of which is involved in an Opposition Proceeding in the European Patent Office. These patents, entitled “Method for the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome,” have claims covering methods for treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome with Fintepla and are expected to provide protection of the associated claims in the U.S. and other countries through 2033 and 2034, respectively. In addition, we are assignees of two Orange Book listed patents covering a controlled distribution system for Fintepla and increasing patient exposure to Fintepla when co-administered with cannabidiol that are expected to provide protection in the U.S. 2035 and 2037 respectively. We have received notices of allowance for two additional US patent applications and paid issue fees, one claiming a high purity fenfluramine API used in our product, and the other claiming a method of treating a patient under the controlled distribution system that are expected to provide additional protection until 2036 and 2035 respectively. 
MT1621
We have certain patent rights that we obtained through our acquisition of Modis. In September 2016, Modis entered into a license agreement with Columbia University under which Modis was granted an exclusive worldwide license and sublicense to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Columbia to develop and commercialize MT1621 and certain backup compounds for any application or purpose. These licensed patent rights include patents owned by Columbia and patents jointly owned by Columbia and Vall d’Hebron Research Institute (VHIR). VHIR delegated to Columbia the rights to enter into the Columbia Agreement on VHIR’s behalf. The patent family jointly owned by Columbia and VHIR is directed to the use of MT1621 to treat TK2d and includes an issued U.S. patent, and two granted patents each in the European, Japanese and Australian patent offices with all six expiring in 2036. In addition, there are pending patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Russia, as well as continuing applications in the United States and Europe. There are no patents covering the composition of matter in MT1621.
We have pending, in appropriate jurisdictions, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and US and Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications for both Fintepla and MT1621. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth we are seeking, or that competitors or other third-parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued.
Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our products and product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11


granted. However, pending patent applications we have filed or licensed from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. 
We believe our patents are valid and do not infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we believe we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third parties except Catholic University of Leuven, University Hospital Antwerp, Columbia University and VHIR from which we have licensed certain patents.
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, record keeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quantity and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S.
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, potency, biological activity, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. Some pre-clinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials, pre-clinical information or cGMP requirements and places a trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12


conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
In some cases, the FDA may condition the approval of the NDA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical studies to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as post-marketing or Phase 4 studies.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) and proposed labeling, among other things.
The submission of an NDA may be subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the PDUFA goals that are currently in effect, the FDA has a standard review goal of ten months from the date of filing of a NDA for a new molecular entity, and ten months from the date of receipt for an NDA for a non-new molecular entity, to review and act on the submission. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13


filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. During the FDA’s review of an NDA the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements before approving an NDA. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Once the FDA’s NDA review process is substantially complete, it may issue an approval letter, or it may issue a complete response letter (CRL) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
For some drugs, the FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug, and may require submission of a REMS as a condition of approval. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA considers the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, the expected benefit of the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the size of the population likely to use the drug, the duration of treatment, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14


Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under its current review goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs, and within six months of the receipt date for non-new molecular entity NDA.
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing clinical trials or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
A sponsor may also seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met.
Fast Track designation, priority review, and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There also are extensive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations applicable to marketed controlled substances. The FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds they are appropriate based on available data, including information regarding related drugs. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. In addition, the FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges.
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
The FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, though the FDA must provide an application holder with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in order to withdraw its approval of an application. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 15


frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug and device products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
An applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA to seek approval for modifications or new uses of products previously approved by the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product based on the prior pre-clinical or clinical trials conducted for the approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform new studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on studies conducted for a previously approved drug product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s current list of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” known as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The Section 505(b)(2) NDA application also will not be accepted or approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the referenced NDA and patent holders once the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge based on the Paragraph IV certification. Under the FFDCA, if a patent infringement lawsuit is filed against the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant within 45 days of receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, an automatic stay of approval is imposed, which prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court decision or settlement finding that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is earlier. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30 month stay if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized.
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 16


The 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year new product exclusivity. The first approved 505(b)(2) applicant for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended-release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA is precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has expired. Additional exclusivities may also apply, such as an added six-month pediatric exclusivity period based on studies conducted in pediatric patients under a written request from the FDA.
Additionally, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may list its own relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if it does, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against subsequent applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying those applicants.
Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. 
In the EU, medicinal products: (a) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in ten thousand people in the EU when the application is made; or (b) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to up to ten years of market exclusivity (which may be extended for an additional two years if pediatric data have been produced in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigational plan). During this ten year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the EC are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more efficacious or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met or if the orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the United States within one year following the date of approval. 
For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. Congress has only authorized the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program until September 30, 2024. Consequently, sponsors of marketing applications approved after that date will not receive the voucher unless Congress reauthorizes the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program. However, even if the program is not reauthorized, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation before October 1, 2024, the sponsor of the marketing application for such drug will be eligible to receive a voucher if the application for the designated drug is approved by the FDA before October 1, 2026.
DEA Regulation
The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. 
Substances in Schedule IV are considered to have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule III. A prescription for controlled substances in Schedule IV issued by a practitioner may be communicated either orally, in writing, or by facsimile to the pharmacist, and may be refilled if so authorized on the prescription or by call-in. Many commonly prescribed sleep aids (e.g., Ambien®, Sonata®), most benzodiazepines (e.g., Ativan®, Valium®, Versed®, Diastat®, Onfi®) and some weight loss drugs (e.g., Belviq®, Qsymia®) are also regulated as Schedule IV drugs.
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and authorization must be obtained to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 18


initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings.
Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
Foreign Regulation of Drug Development and Approval
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements including those governing drug development, pre-clinical trials, human clinical trials, marketing approval, manufacturing, pharmacovigilance and post-marketing regulation for drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The approval process varies from country to country, can involve additional testing beyond that required by FDA, and may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, promotion, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under the EU regulatory system, we may submit applications for marketing authorizations in more than one EU Member State either under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the EC on the basis of a positive opinion by the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (ChMP) and is mandatory for certain categories of medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all EU Member States and the European Economic Area states. The decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure apply between EU Member States. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the competent authority of all EU member states in which the product is to be marketed. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require this authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national competent authorities of EU Member States by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State member state for the same medicinal product. The EC may agree upon recommendation of the EMA to grant for medicines including those designated as orphan medicines a (i) conditional marketing authorization in the interest of public health under certain conditions; namely that unmet medical needs will be fulfilled, the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, the benefit to public health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data and it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data; or (ii) marketing authorization under “exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles.
In 2016, the EMA launched its Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. The scheme focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines by the EMA. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of the marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.

Similar to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. This includes control of compliance by the companies within the EU legal framework (i.e., GCP, GLP, cGMP and pharmacovigilance rules, which govern quality control of the manufacturing process and require documentation policies and procedures). We and our third party manufacturers are required under regulations to ensure that all of our processes, methods, and equipment are compliant with GCP, GLP, cGMP and pharmacovigilance rules. The EMA and national competent authorities have in the past, and expect that they will continue to, may arrange inspections to ensure that we adhere to these principles and regulations. Any adverse findings from such inspections, depending on their severity, may result in significant delays in obtaining a marketing authorization, may impose penalties or may result in other action by regulatory authorities.
Failure by us or by any of our third party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, marketers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products, pre-approval promotion of products, reporting of adverse health events, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, and marketing/promotion of such products following grant of authorization may result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays in or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing, or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines, and criminal penalties.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products.
In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the TRICARE, Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Moreover, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors or statutory exceptions. Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and have brought cases against numerous pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and certain sales and marketing personnel for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business or reward past purchases or recommendations.
Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 20


Average Manufacturer Price and improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label). In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud, and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, the ACA) also imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to teaching hospitals and physicians (as defined by statute), and any ownership or investment interested held by such physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Beginning in 2022, such reporting obligations will extend to any payments and other transfer of value made during the prior calendar year to certain other health care professionals, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for any payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and additional penalties for “knowing failures”. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year.
Under California law, pharmaceutical companies must adopt a comprehensive compliance program that is in accordance with both the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (OIG Guidance) and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code). The PhRMA Code seeks to promote transparency in relationships between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry and to ensure that pharmaceutical marketing activities comport with the highest ethical standards. The PhRMA Code contains strict limitations on certain interactions between health care professionals and the pharmaceutical industry relating to gifts, meals, entertainment and speaker programs, among others. Also, certain states have imposed restrictions on the types of interactions that pharmaceutical companies or their agents (e.g., sales representatives) may have with health care professionals, including bans or strict limitations on the provision of meals, entertainment, hospitality, travel and lodging expenses, and other financial support, including funding for continuing medical education activities.
Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
Violations of any of these laws or other governmental regulations may result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements or oversight if the drug manufacturer becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non‑compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of its operations.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We and our collaborators and third-party providers may be subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy and security laws and regulations. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 21


health information privacy laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators and third-party service providers. For example, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and regulations implemented thereunder, which establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information by “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers) and the “business associates” with whom such covered entities contract for services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health information.
In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates, if and when commercialized, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third-party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost-containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
Changes in third-party payor coverage and reimbursement rules can impact our business. For example, the ACA changes include increased rebates a manufacturer must pay to the Medicaid program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now provide 70% point-of-sale discounts on products covered under Part D. Further, the law imposes a significant annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, or Tax Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the entire ACA is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Act repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a 
Zogenix Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 22


temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, and/or continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, as well as increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 218 full-time employees, consisting of 168 employed in the United States, 47 employed in the United Kingdom and other European countries and three in Japan. Of these employees, 100 were engaged primarily in product development, quality assurance and clinical development and regulatory activities, 58 were engaged primarily in sales and commercialization activities, seven were engaged primarily in manufacturing, and the remaining 53 were engaged primarily in management and general and administrative activities.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. We currently utilize two employer services companies to provide human resource services. These service companies are the employer of record for payroll, benefits, employee relations and other employment-related administration.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our management team and our clinical, scientific and other employees and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to align our interests and the interests of our stockholders with those of our employees and consultants.
