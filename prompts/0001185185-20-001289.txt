ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General Overview
 
The Company is a provider of energy-efficient lighting products, lighting controls and energy management solutions. The Company offers a full turn-key lighting solution which includes economic assessments, energy efficient analysis, installation and rebate support for the Company’s customers. The Company’s business primarily involves retrofitting existing lighting solutions from traditional high intensity fluorescent lighting to energy efficient LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology.
 
Managing energy consumption and the associated costs is increasingly important to building owners. Technological advancements in LED, together with significant private and public incentives for sustainability initiatives have made lighting infrastructure changes an effective way for building owners to cut energy costs. LED lighting provides energy efficiency, long life, low running temperatures and increasing technology such as dimmable lights.
 
The Company does not have long-term contracts with its customers, and the Company’s revenue comes from the sales of lighting systems involving the replacement of existing lighting fixtures with new energy efficient LED fixtures. In addition, the Company generates revenue from the sale of lighting products.
 
The Company provides its turn-key service though a detailed evaluation of the customer’s needs and performing an audit of the customer’s current energy consumptions and costs, together with an analysis of the benefits of retrofitting their lights. Typically, the customer experiences an average payback on their investment between 12 and 24 months.

The Company intends to grow organically by selling energy efficiency (EE) to industrial and commercial businesses as well as municipal and state governments, universities and colleges, K-12 schools, and hospitals (the “MUSH” market). The Company increases its competitive position by providing funding for EE projects through its strategic partnership with a well-established funding group focused on energy efficiency projects.
 
In addition, the Company will look for accretive acquisitions in the diverse and fragmented EE marketplace.

Subsequent Events
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2018 through the filing date, the Company has issued 50,450,000 shares of common stock. In December 2019, the Company issued 2,500,000 shares in exchange for $250,000 to an unrelated accredited investor. For the shares that were granted, 11,200,000 shares were issued to the Chairman of the Board in exchange for the cancellation of 19,000,000 stock options and 2,000,000 warrants outstanding. In addition, 4,000,000 shares were issued in exchange for business development efforts. On July 9, 2019, the Company issued 20,000,000 shares to its Chief Executive Officer. The remainder of shares were issued to various parties for services to the Company.
 
In April 2020, the Company received an unsecured loan (the "SBA Loan") under the Small Business Administration ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act CARES Act through Chase Bank (“Lender”).  The SBA Loan has a two-year term expiring on April 2022. The SBA Loan has a principal amount of $237,457 with an interest rate of 1.0%. The Company expects that the full principal amount of the loan will be forgiven.  Interest accrues during the period between funding date and the date the loan is forgiven.   
 
The Company has borrowed $1,624,127 from related parties since December 31, 2018. These loans from related parties were made on various dates in March 2019, April 2019 and October 2019 to August 2020, and have various payment terms up to six (6) months. All of these loans are unsecured.
 
The Company has borrowed $527,962 from various third-party lenders, none of which are financial institutions. These loans were made on various dates in August 2019 and October 2019 to December 2019, have various terms payment terms up to ten (10) months and all are secured by, inventory, receivables or the equity in the corporate headquarters building.
 
The Company is unsure of the outcome of the COVID-19 novel Coranavirus pandemic on its business. The duration of the pandemic, its effect on business in general and its effect on the Company specifically are unknown to management. For example, the Company’s largest client, one of the world’s largest clothing retail stores, was forced to close its doors at the onset of the pandemic and only recently re-opened some of its stores, thereby allowing the Company to continue to retrofit the stores with its LED lighting system. A continuation of the pandemic, a second surge of the pandemic, or a failure to find and commercialize a vaccine for COVID-19 could materially impact the Company’s revenues and its operations.
 
Financing Strategy
 
The Company only recently has begun to generate revenue from the sale of its services. The Company has invested in additional sales staff and has incurred costs developing its customer auditing process. These expenses are partially funded by cash flow from its revenues, but the Company is currently operating below break-even due to its operating investments. As a result, the Company had to rely on additional debt and advances, primarily from its shareholders as well as the sale of additional shares of common stock. The Company anticipates that it will continue to fund its operations through the revenue it derives from services and rebates but will also need to finance its needs through additional debt, advances and through the sale of its shares of common stock, which will result in dilution to the current owners of the Company’s shares. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful and raising additional debt and advances or to sell additional securities, or that such offerings, if successful will provide the Company with sufficient capital to implement its business plan.
Competition
 
The energy efficiency segment for small and medium sized commercial businesses is fragmented and highly competitive. The Company competes with various types and sizes of companies ranging from local and national service providers.

The efficient lighting market, which is part of the energy efficiency market, is also highly competitive, with some of the largest suppliers of lighting components also serving many of the same markets and competing for the same customers. Competition is based on numerous factors, including features and benefits, brand name recognition, product quality, product and lighting system design, energy efficiency, customer relationships, service capabilities, and price. The Company’s largest competitors in the North American lighting market include the lighting divisions of Acuity Brands, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Eaton Corporation, Hubbell Incorporated, Schneider Electric, Cree, Inc., and General Electric Company. The Company estimates that the largest publicly-traded manufacturers, which participate in varying degrees in the North American lighting market, have over half of the total market share. In addition to these large competitors, the Company also competes with hundreds of manufacturers of varying size.
