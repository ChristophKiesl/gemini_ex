Item 1. Business.
Overview
Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading healthcare platform that leverages advanced analytics, technology, and nationwide healthcare provider networks to create and power value-based payment programs. Our mission is to transform how care is paid for and delivered so that people can enjoy more healthy, happy days at home. Our customers include health plans, governments, employers, health systems and physician groups. We believe that we are a market leader in two fast-growing segments of the value-based healthcare payment industry: payment models based on individual episodes of care and in-home health evaluations (“IHEs”). Payment models based on individual episodes of care organize or bundle payments for all, or a substantial portion of, services received by a patient in connection with an episode of care, such as a surgical procedure, particular condition or other reason for a hospital stay. IHEs are health evaluations performed by a clinician in the home to support payors’ participation in Medicare Advantage and other government-run managed care plans. Our episode payment platform managed $5.21 billion of spend under the Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI-A”) program in 2020. Our mobile network of providers conducted over 1.4 million IHEs for individuals participating in Medicare Advantage and other managed care plans in 2020. We believe that these core businesses have enabled us to become integral to how health plans and healthcare providers successfully participate in value-based payment programs, and that our platform lessens the dependence on facility-centric care for acute and post-acute services and shifts more services towards alternate sites and, most importantly, the home.
Value-based payment programs are rapidly transforming how governments, employers, and health plans pay for and manage healthcare services. The objective of these initiatives is to improve patient outcomes while lowering the overall cost of healthcare services. We believe that our differentiated data assets, proprietary analytics capabilities, comprehensive cloud-based software platforms, and healthcare provider networks enable success in the two dominant forms of value-based payments: population-based payment programs and episode-based payment programs. Medicare Advantage is one of the largest population-based payment initiatives and the Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (“BPCI”) initiative is one of the largest episode-based payment programs. We have leading positions serving both of these fast-growing sectors, as measured by our volume of IHEs and the program size of our episodes business, respectively.
Our solutions support value-based payment programs by aligning financial incentives around outcomes, providing tools to health plans and healthcare organizations designed to assess and manage risk and identify actionable opportunities for improved patient outcomes, coordination and cost-savings. Through our platform, we coordinate what we believe is a holistic suite of clinical, social, and behavioral services to address an individual’s healthcare needs and prevent adverse events that drive excess cost. Our business model is aligned with our customers as we generate revenue only when we successfully engage members for our health plan customers and generate savings for our provider customers.
We serve 47 Medicare Advantage health plans ranging from the largest national organizations to smaller regional and provider-owned entities. We also serve thousands of healthcare provider organizations ranging from large integrated delivery systems to midsize and small urban and rural entities. We also serve large biopharmaceutical customers in our emerging biopharmaceutical business.
Our Solutions
Home & Community Services
In our Home & Community Services segment, we offer a variety of solutions to help manage the health of our customers’ members in their homes.

In-home health evaluations and related services
We believe we have the largest mobile network of credentialed providers in the United States, which we deploy into the home primarily to conduct IHEs and to perform select diagnostic services. Through our IHEs, we create a comprehensive, documented record of the clinical, social, and behavioral needs of our health plan customers’ medically complex populations and seek to further engage them with the healthcare system. Working with data from our health plan customers, our operating platform and advanced data analytics seek to identify the highest priority individuals for an in-home evaluation. We then engage with those members to schedule visits to perform IHEs. While in the home, our providers perform IHEs with the assistance of our longitudinal patient records and our proprietary clinical workflow software with its integrated device hub. Our software guides clinical workflows as well as in-home diagnostic screenings, yielding a rich patient report of approximately 240 data points. The duration of our IHEs is up to 2.5 times longer than the average visit with a primary care physician (“PCP”). While performing these evaluations, we also seek to engage individuals more closely with the healthcare system. For example, the evaluation results of IHEs are provided to individuals’ PCPs. We believe sharing these results helps to fill gaps in care, while encouraging individuals who do not regularly visit their PCP to schedule a visit. In 2019, the most recent data available, more than 90% of the members we evaluated followed up with a primary care visit.
In addition to providing health plans with insights into member health without taking members out of the home, the patient reports our IHEs produce form the basis of the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) scores, which are required for health plans to effectively participate in value-based and risk-adjusted government programs like Medicare Advantage and affect the premiums health plans receive for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. The data we gather is used by health plans to improve their Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) scores and Medicare Advantage Star Ratings (“Star Ratings”). Following our success in Medicare Advantage, we have entered new markets in recent years, such as Managed Medicaid in 17 states as well as supporting our customers’ Affordable Care Act Exchange lines of business, both of which are subject to quality-based payments and risk adjustment to varying degrees. We conducted over 1.4 million IHEs (including vIHEs) in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Telehealth through virtual IHEs
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in close coordination with our customers, we accelerated our telehealth initiatives by quickly launching virtual IHEs (“vIHEs”) in the second quarter of 2020. vIHEs primarily take place via videoconference. vIHEs have allowed us to engage with high-need, vulnerable individuals during a critical time, ensuring that our health plan customers maintain detailed insights into their members’ health and are able to coordinate services accordingly. Leveraging our technology and engagement tools, our staff and clinical network successfully completed more than 0.5 million vIHEs using a combination of audio and video connectivity in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Social determinants of health
We bring community-based organizations (“CBOs”) together into outcomes-focused networks that are designed to address social determinants of health (“SDOH”). In 2019, we started utilizing telephonic outreach and comprehensive, in-home evaluations to directly identify the social determinants of an individual’s health, such as food insecurity, slip and fall risk, access to transportation, social isolation, and the financial resources to afford medications. For certain customers, we combine this assessment with IHEs and refer to this combined product as an IHE+. Beginning in 2020, we began referring individuals directly to CBOs in our network through our Signify Community platform, leveraging the platform as a system of record for referral workflow and data capture. For our health plan customers, we believe this feature adds an advanced SDOH component to an already high-value IHE product and helps us to drive increased member engagement.

Biopharmaceutical Services
In recent years, we have begun deploying our provider network in service of other sectors such as the biopharmaceutical sector. We approach this sector from two vantage points: approved therapies and decentralized trials. In the former, we are assisting patients in starting complex therapies more quickly, by providing them first-dose observations at home, in direct contract with major pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the latter, we leverage our deep domain expertise in addressing social determinants to provide caregiver support services designed to improve trial subject retention, lower trial costs and increase speed to trial completion. 
Episodes of Care Services
In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we develop provider networks, build software and deliver services that support the organization and financing of healthcare around a patient’s episode of care. Our customers include the payors offering episode of care programs, as well as the providers who participate in such programs when delivering healthcare services.
We operate a large episode-based program, with $5.21 billion of spend under management in 2020. Our programs, platforms and networks drive care redesign to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. We believe we accomplish these goals by reducing variations in care delivery, identifying cost saving opportunities and propelling recovery homeward. In so doing, we help to improve the coordination of care among clinicians, facilities and individuals along the care continuum. In 2020, we generated savings of $381 million, while seeking also to improve key measures of patient outcomes. Furthermore, the BPCI-A episodes we managed which were initiated in the last quarter of 2019 resulted in approximately 15% greater discharges home from acute-care facilities and approximately 10% lower readmissions when compared to the historical performance of our provider partners for similar episodes.
The complexity and risk associated with episode of care programs leads payors and healthcare providers to seek expertise in the many disciplines required to achieve success in these programs. Our episodes of care capabilities include:
•We own libraries of episode definitions and also work with open source versions of episode definitions to implement and develop clinical episodes. We are able to implement surgical or medical episodes, such as those for knee replacements, colonoscopies, pregnancy and newborn deliveries, as well as condition-centric episodes, including those addressing chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, and behavioral health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse disorders. 
•We have data analytics capabilities that enable us to analyze payment data from multiple sources in order to provide payors and providers with information about clinical episode initiation, real-time status and episode of care program performance for an individual patient, a participating provider’s practice and a payor’s overall program. 
•We use episode definitions to analyze data and help determine a fair benchmark price for a specific episode. We are able to utilize a payor or provider’s historical claims data and benchmark data, and trend that data forward to make predictions about future costs for individual episodes at the individual provider level. 
•We can help payors determine where and how episodes of care can improve care coordination, reduce expenditures and improve outcomes for their members, and we can help design an episode of care program, develop pricing, recruit and contract with participating providers, provide protocols for launching a program and engage directly with contracted providers on care optimization. 
•We have a field-based organization that recruits healthcare provider organizations into episode of care programs and then helps them implement care redesign and manage episode of care programs. 
•We have a proprietary suite of software tools, called Signify Connect, which includes our Episode Connect software that supports health systems and physician organizations in managing their episode of care programs. This platform includes workflow tools that identify patients using predictive analytics, assist with the creation and implementation of care coordination plans, facilitate communication between providers across a patient’s care team and enable providers to manage and track a patient’s care during an episode of care. 
6


•We have decision support tools to support providers when important decisions are being made upon discharge from an acute care facility on the next site of care. Our decision support tools are grounded in clinical information, at the individual episode level, to help healthcare providers transition patients to the optimal next care setting. For our Commercial Episodes of Care services, we also have decision support tools that support decision making around appropriate sites of care, such as whether a particular procedure should be performed at an acute-care hospital or an ambulatory surgery center. 
•We have an expansive analytics platform that includes a real-time dashboard that delivers information at the aggregate level as well as at the patient level, and a wide range of reports that enables users to configure how they want to see the data available from Episode Connect and the other data sources that populate our longitudinal view of individual patients. 
•We offer comprehensive administrative services that support the back-office activities required to launch and manage episode of care programs. 
In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we offer a variety of solutions to help our customers participate in episode-based programs.
Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI and BPCI-A)
We are the largest convener participant in the BPCI-A program by number of episodes managed. In this role, we hold contracts directly with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) pursuant to which we are responsible for developing and monitoring a BPCI-A episode of care program in partnership with healthcare providers. We enter into back-to-back contracts with providers participating in the BPCI-A program, whereby we facilitate coordination among providers and share financial risk. To enable our provider partners to successfully participate in BPCI-A, we provide a suite of analytic, technology and post-acute management services in exchange for an administrative fee (which is paid out of savings) and a share of any incremental savings or losses related to episodes initiated by our provider partners.
BPCI-A employs (and BPCI employed) a retrospective payment system in which Medicare reimburses providers in accordance with their usual fee-for-service (“FFS”) payment schedule, while also tracking the total FFS costs for all billable services rendered during the episode period (generally 90 days from the date of discharge from the acute-care facility). Upon completion of each episode, CMS compares the total amount of all FFS payments made during the episode against a predetermined benchmark price. If the total FFS costs of the episode exceeds the benchmark price, the designated program participant owes the difference to CMS, and likewise, if total FFS costs of the episode are lower than the benchmark price, then CMS pays the difference (representing the incremental savings achieved) to the designated program participant.
While increasing care coordination has been shown to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs in the healthcare system, it can require significant time and specialized resources that many healthcare systems, hospitals and physician group practices lack. We address these needs and enable our provider partners to successfully participate in BPCI-A by providing data analytics, tools and support from the initial stages of care redesign, to identifying and tracking individuals, to managing patients’ post-acute care, through handling program reconciliation and the distribution of shared savings. Our services include the following:
•Data Integration & Patient Identification: We set up secure data feeds with our provider partners and are able to receive data from all leading electronic health record (“EHR”) systems, which allows us access to real-time EHR data in order to quickly predict and identify individuals that are likely to be attributed to a BPCI-A bundle. When a clinical event or procedure occurs which initiates, or “triggers,” an episode, our proprietary software platform, Episode Connect, identifies the individual. This allows providers to begin tracking the individual’s care journey enabling them to intervene at key moments in the journey. 
7


•Care Redesign Processes: Our approach is designed to create lasting change in the management of higher-risk patients in the acute and post-acute setting. We utilize locally based team members to engage with our provider partners in an effort to maximize patient recovery and stabilization. In the acute setting, we focus on key goals around effective transition to the appropriate post-acute facility for the patient by partnering directly within the acute-care hospital with all members of the typically interdisciplinary team treating a patient. In the post-acute setting, our team works directly with the facility and provider to align processes that support improved patient outcomes. 
•Decision Support Tools: Once an individual is ready to be discharged from the acute setting, our suite of tools provides recommendations on the most appropriate next site of care (e.g., home vs. post-acute facility), as well as information on the post-acute providers within our network that may best be able to support the patient’s needs. 
•Post-Acute Network Development & Management: To further facilitate coordination of care, we develop and manage local networks of high-quality, high-value healthcare providers, including skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies, which can serve individuals participating in bundles at each stage of care. Our team of post-acute specialists regularly meets with post-acute care providers to review care plans and promote adherence to evidence-based guidelines, providing guidance on early identification of clinical and social gaps that may impact readmissions risks. 
•Incentive Alignment, Gainsharing & Information Sharing: The BPCI-A program permits second-tier payment arrangements between the relevant program provider participant and a downstream healthcare provider who has participated in an individual’s care. Provider partners are permitted to share risk with downstream participating providers as a way to align financial incentives and improve cooperation among providers, generating more favorable patient outcomes and increased savings. We connect our provider partners with downstream providers, and we negotiate and administer these gainsharing agreements on behalf of our customers. We also act as the paying agent, distributing (or collecting) gainsharing payments in connection with each semiannual reconciliation. We also facilitate coordination among these providers. Episode Connect allows these providers to share data, further increasing coordination. For example, our provider partner can review patient-specific information throughout the post-acute care continuum, including patient progress to recovery goals as well as the transition from a post-acute facility to home health services. This type of coordination allows us and our provider partners to better track an individual’s progress and assess when they are ready to self-manage in the home. 
•Reconciliation Analysis, Benchmarking & Performance Review: At the end of each BPCI-A performance measurement period, we review reconciliation statements from CMS, identify errors and distribute shared savings. In addition, our platform generates reports on healthcare providers’ performance, showing their performance benchmarked both against their own historical performance, as well as against peers in their geography. In this way, we close the loop on an episode by providing actionable insights that a provider can use the next time an episode is initiated. 
Commercial Episodes of Care
In 2020, we launched our Commercial Episodes of Care services and began offering program sponsors, including health plans, employers and state government agencies, the analytics, software tools and services necessary to design, launch and administer episodes of care programs outside of the BPCI-A context. This opened new markets and, equally significant, new chronic care episodes to us. 
As with our BPCI-A program, we deploy our care coordination resources directly in the field to create the relationship with the local providers that effectively drives process transformation. In addition to the services we provide in the BPCI-A program, we also offer the following services as part of our growing commercial business:
•Program Design: Using our advanced data analytics capabilities, we help program sponsors identify the potential benefits of an episode of care program, both from a financial and strategic perspective, and assist them with the initial program design, including episode of care selection and pricing. Importantly, our episode of care programs also include measures designed to improve patient outcomes by reducing the incidence of adverse events and potentially avoidable or wasteful services. 
8


•Provider Network Recruitment, Contracting & Support: Leveraging our expertise, credibility with providers established through the BPCI-A program and suite of provider tools, we recruit providers into the program sponsor’s episode of care program. By sharing risk with providers, we align incentives and build trust, which we believe puts us in a unique position to encourage program participation and takes the burden of network recruitment off program sponsors. We equip participating providers with tools designed to identify opportunities for improved patient care while achieving cost savings and educate them on the levers that support improved patient outcomes while generating savings within each clinical episode type (which differ considerably from those in the BPCI-A program). 
•Expanded Decision Support Tools: We expand our decision support tools to align to the specific decisions that a provider makes in the expanded episodes, such as the appropriate site of care for a surgery. These tools evaluate quality, cost and convenience. Our tools also update the provider on services that are being delivered during the patient’s care journey. 
•Additional Program Sponsor Support: We deliver to program sponsors a comprehensive analytics platform that includes episode pricing, monitoring and reporting of performance at the individual beneficiary, provider and program level. We perform program reconciliations, provide reconciliation statements to program sponsors and participating providers and collect and distribute program savings and losses among payors and providers.
Transition to Home
In 2020, we introduced our Transition to Home (“TTH”) service, a support model for patients transitioning home from a hospital or a post-acute care facility that aims to reduce the likelihood of readmission. The readmission rate for BPCI-A patients can be greater than 30%, and we estimate that the average cost of a readmission of a BPCI-A patient, including related post-acute costs, is approximately $17,000. Leveraging our provider network and community-based services, we work to prevent readmissions by providing individuals with continued support from our social care coordinators and, when necessary, our nurses and nurse practitioners.
Complex Care Management
We also offer health plans a solution to manage the clinical needs and well-being of their members with complex chronic conditions through a multi-disciplinary approach. Our providers engage with high-needs individuals in facilities. By looking at an individual’s medical needs and well-being holistically, the provider is able to address elements of the individual’s care plan such as medication adjustments, adherence to care plans and patient behavioral and nutritional needs.
ACO Services
In 2020, we began helping accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) manage the post-acute care of their patient populations. Our ACO solution expands on the BPCI-A definitions with a more comprehensive suite of episodic conditions that are managed through the post-acute setting. We use the same data analytics capabilities we use in our BPCI-A services to analyze historical data and identify opportunities for post-acute cost savings for ACOs. In addition, ACOs have access to our platform through which they can access data across care settings and follow the patient more closely throughout the post-acute episode. This information allows ACOs to make informed decisions with respect to, among other things, treatment, cost management, next site of care and length of post-acute care. Finally, we utilize our teams of acute and post-acute specialists to support the delivery of appropriate post-acute care to ACO patients. 
Industry
Total U.S. healthcare spending exceeded $3.8 trillion in 2019 and we operate in the large market associated with payment for healthcare services. We serve needs of healthcare funding sources including Medicare, Medicaid, employers and private health plans. Signify Health operates in the value-based payment sector of the healthcare industry. We believe value-based payments have grown dramatically over the past ten years and are expected to eventually represent the majority of healthcare spending in the United States according to studies by Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (“HCP-LAN”) and other research reports by industry analysts, which suggest 
9


that approximately 60% to 70% of total U.S. health spending is expected to be tied to quality and value by 2025 through the adoption of new payment models focused on value. We believe this will especially be the case as value-based payment models continue to penetrate the commercial insured and self-funded markets. Our leadership position in enabling some of the most significant risk programs has allowed us to invest in and develop differentiated scale and expertise around analytics, technology, networks, and relationships to grow rapidly as demand for services in the value-based payment industry increases over time.
Industry reports estimate the current addressable market for value-based payor programs, such as Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, is at least $300 billion, with 79 million members enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care. Under such payor value-based care programs, payor rates are set based upon overall population risk. Through these arrangements, payors take on risk and need to develop an accurate picture of the health of their patient population in order to receive appropriate funding. Adjusting funding based upon a member’s health helps stabilize payor value-based care programs and incentivizes payors to enroll both healthy and higher cost members. A critical element to developing and understanding the overall health of a patient population is an accurate health evaluation in the home and coding of each individual patient’s health conditions. While the overall cost to perform these activities is a small component of total spending, there is significant value from the resulting data that is captured.
According to HCP-LAN, in 2018, approximately $400 billion of provider spending flowed through value-based payment models, such as bundled payment models, which are alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service payment models. HCP-LAN reported that of this $400 billion, approximately $142 billion of spending was through value-based payment models where providers also assumed potential risk in the event of suboptimal outcomes, as opposed to models where providers only stood to benefit from shared savings without the possibility of bearing downside risk. Under provider value-based care programs, healthcare provider reimbursement is tied to the outcomes and the overall quality of care delivered to patients. Value-based care reimbursement is different from the standard fee-for-service model in that providers are reimbursed based on the financial value of the healthcare services they provide and are rewarded for both efficiency and effectiveness. In order for providers to be able to participate in value-based care models, they need to utilize solutions that can track and report on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, patient engagement, and more. They also need tools to help them analyze costs, redesign care and align incentives with other healthcare providers. These solutions are used to organize and finance healthcare delivery around a patient’s episode of care to ensure higher quality outcomes at improved costs.
Competition
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily in the market associated with payment for healthcare services, where large and small companies are formulating innovative ways to transition the healthcare market to value-based care with an increasing focus on treating individuals within the home. In our Home & Community Services segment, we compete with local and national providers of in-home diagnostic and evaluative services. Our competitors include pure-play companies whose principal business is providing IHEs and similar services as well as large payors that have in-house capabilities for performing a portion of their IHEs in house. Among pure-play companies, our primary competitor is Matrix Medical Network, which we believe is the only other pure-play company providing IHEs with national scale. With respect to large payors, most large payors use a variety of different providers for their IHE volume and several large payors service a portion of their total volume with their own in-house capabilities. For example, Humana has a division called Your Home Advantage and UnitedHealth has a division called OptumCare, each of which performs IHEs for a portion of each payor’s plan members. As a result, we compete with these in-house capabilities for additional volume. Although large payors such as Humana and UnitedHealth have more resources than we do, because we focus principally on IHEs and have dedicated significant resources to building the breadth of our national network, we believe we are able to more efficiently perform IHEs than these in-house divisions and we have consistently increased our volume with large payors such as Humana and UnitedHealth in recent years.
In our Home & Community Services segment, we also compete for, among other things, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other medical and non-medical personnel. In particular, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining qualified providers for our mobile network, in particular from telehealth service providers.
10


In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we compete with healthcare risk management providers, primarily in the BPCI-A space. Our competitors include companies like us that convene (i.e., contract) with CMS on behalf of healthcare providers as well as physician group practices that “self-convene” under BPCI-A, meaning they contract directly with CMS to participate in BPCI-A rather than working through a company like Signify Health. In terms of traditional conveners, we compete with naviHealth (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth), OptumCare, Fusion5 and Archway. The largest self-conveners include Sound Physicians and other large physician group practices. To a lesser extent, we also compete with companies such as Change Healthcare that provide ancillary services to support the BPCI-A management process, such as software for patient tracking or analytics services. Because we provide a full suite of management solutions, we have not faced significant competition to date from these companies, although we may face more intense competition from them in the future.
In the commercial episodes of care space, we believe we are one of the only companies offering a comprehensive suite of services and technology solutions to help customers build episode programs and then recruit providers to participate. However, we do compete with companies offering episodes of care or bundled payment consulting services. In this space, we compete primarily with Aver, Cognizant and Cedar Gate.
Our principal competitors in both of our segments vary considerably in type and identity by market. There have also been increasing indications of interest from non-traditional providers and others to enter the in-home diagnostic and evaluative services space and/or develop innovative technologies or business activities that could be disruptive to the healthcare risk management industry.
Sales and Marketing
In each of our segments, we focus our sales and marketing initiatives on three primary dimensions of growth: (1) sales to new customers, (2) cross-sales to existing customers and (3) product expansion with existing customers. In order to successfully obtain new customers and to cross-sell solutions to existing customers, we have a strong sales team that is organized by segment as well as by product/service offered. For example, we have sales representatives dedicated to selling our IHE solutions in our Home & Community Services segment. These representatives are responsible for selling our IHE solutions to new customers as well as cross-selling to existing customers.
Similarly, in our Episodes of Care Services segment, we have representatives dedicated to selling our solutions to new and existing customers. For example, since 2019, BPCI-A participants have not been able to change their convener and will not be able to do so until the program expires in 2023, assuming it is renewed. However, we are able to offer our full suite of solutions to self-conveners to support their participation in BPCI-A, even though they do not participate in BPCI-A through us. Our sales representatives that specialize in BPCI-A are currently focused on selling our services to self-convener participants that we do not currently work with. We also believe there are significant cross-selling opportunities in our Episodes of Care Services segment. For example, most of our BPCI-A customers also serve ACO populations and we have dedicated sales representatives focused on selling our ACO services to our BPCI-A customers.
In terms of product expansion with existing customers, we also have a certain number of sales representatives that are not organized by segment, but are instead responsible for managing significant existing customer relationships. These representatives focus on engaging with our customers and finding ways that we can expand and grow with our customers. For example, these representatives may focus on increasing the volume of IHEs we perform for existing customers in our Home & Community Services segment, or they may work with existing BPCI-A customers to see if there is different or better data available to guide a customer through the program.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand, technology and inventions; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties.
11


We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we exclusively owned 20 trademark applications and registrations in the United States, including Signify Health. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use or may use in our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had no issued patents and, other than one patent application which we intend to abandon, no pending patent applications anywhere in the world, and therefore, we do not have patent protection for any of our proprietary technology, including our proprietary software, mobile app or web portal. 
We rely upon trade secrets, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential information are difficult to protect. We seek to control access to and distribution of our confidential and proprietary information, including our algorithms, source and object code, designs, and business processes, through physical, technical, and administrative security measures and contractual restrictions. We seek to limit access to our confidential and proprietary information on a “need to know” basis and enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors that may receive or otherwise have access to any confidential or proprietary information. We also obtain written invention assignment agreements from our employees, consultants, and vendors that assign to us all right, interest and title to inventions and work products developed during their employment or service engagement with us. 
Government Regulation
Our operations and those of the providers we employ and contract with are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, billings and reports to government payment programs, equipment, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, licensure, information privacy and security compliance, and quality assurance programs.
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies and private members and payors with whom we contract at any time in the future. See “Risk factors—Risks related to governmental regulation.”
Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Bundled Payment Initiatives and ACOs
Medicare
Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through various contractors. Available to individuals age 65 or over, and certain other individuals, the Medicare program provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals, subject to certain deductibles and copayments.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. Medicare is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare providers. Any such changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting the entities with which we contract could have a material effect on our performance.
Medicare Advantage
Under the Medicare Advantage program, also known as Medicare Part C, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Medicare 
12


Advantage plans can be structured as Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”), Preferred Provider Organizations (“PPOs”) or private FFS plans. In addition to covering Part A and Part B benefits, the health insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and plan costs on beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries that choose to participate in Medicare Advantage choose which health plan through which to receive their Medicare coverage. To assist beneficiaries with plan selection, CMS established a five-star quality rating system. Using this system, CMS publishes Star Ratings based on a variety of quality, patient satisfaction and performance measures for health plans on an annual basis. These ratings are based on data gathered from a variety of sources, including HEDIS, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program, the Medicare Health Outcome Survey, the Medicare Prescription Drug Program and CMS administrative data. According to CMS, over one-third of all Medicare enrollees participate in Medicare Advantage plans.
CMS generally pays health insurance plans that participate in the Medicare Advantage program on a per capita basis. CMS makes certain adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings. The IHEs that we provide to our health plan customers may be used, in part, to support RAF scores attributable to the Medicare Advantage plan members and, thus, payment adjustments made by CMS. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members chosen at random. Such audits may result in payment adjustments to a Medicare Advantage plan, including extrapolation across the entire plan. Our health plan customers may seek to hold us liable for penalties owed to CMS for inaccurate or unsupportable RAF scores based on information provided by us. In addition, the government or a whistleblower could assert that our errors caused the plan to submit false claims to CMS, which could subject us to liability under the FCA. 
Medicaid
Medicaid programs provide medical assistance benefits to qualifying (typically low income or medically needy) persons. Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a Prospective Payment System (PPS) or are based on negotiated payment levels. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a healthcare provider’s cost of services. The ACA requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. Some states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Other states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. With the change of Administration, CMS has informed states that it is commencing a process of determining whether to withdraw certain previously approved state flexibilities in the administration of Medicaid programs, including those that allowed states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement.
Because most state governments must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states may adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Many states have adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on healthcare providers to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems.
Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse healthcare providers for medical assistance provided to treat certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to healthcare providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.
Congress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims, identify overpayments, and perform other program integrity activities, many of which were previously performed by Medicaid Integrity Contractors. The UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate healthcare provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are required to establish Medicaid RAC programs. These programs vary by state in design and operation.

Bundled Payment Initiatives
CMMI is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while improving quality of care. For example, healthcare providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to be responsible for the costs of services provided to Medicare patients experiencing certain medical conditions which trigger an episode of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding healthcare providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing healthcare providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Healthcare providers may receive incentive payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode falls below or exceeds a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMMI has implemented bundled payment models, including the BPCI program and the BPCI-A program, the latter of which is voluntary and expected to run through December 2023. Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS has required healthcare providers in selected geographic areas to participate in a mandatory bundled program for specified orthopedic procedures, the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, which is scheduled to run through December 2020. HHS has indicated that it plans to implement additional bundled payment programs, some of which will be mandatory. 
CMS continues to express support for shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and/or value, including bundled payment and pay-for-performance programs. Several private third-party payers are increasingly employing such reimbursement models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to healthcare providers.
Accountable Care Organizations
An ACO is a network of healthcare providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which was established pursuant to the ACA, and the Next Generation ACO Model.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
The AKS prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the AKS include imprisonment, fines and exclusion of the healthcare provider from future participation in the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the AKS are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of the AKS include up to $100,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. The ACA amended the AKS to clarify the intent that is required to prove a violation. Under the statute as amended, the defendant does not need to have actual knowledge of the AKS or have the specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA amended the AKS to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA.
14


The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor do not violate the AKS. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
Our episodes of care programs involve a number of arrangements that potentially implicate the AKS because they may involve payments intended to influence behavior relative to Medicare and other federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including risk sharing and “gainsharing” arrangements. While there is no fixed definition of a gainsharing arrangement, the term typically refers to an arrangement in which a share of cost savings for patient care attributable in part to a physician’s efforts are shared with the physician. The OIG has recognized that there are legitimate interests in enlisting physicians in efforts to reduce unnecessary costs from the healthcare system and, if appropriately structured, such gainsharing arrangements should not violate the AKS. With respect to BPCI-A and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of certain fraud and abuse laws, including the AKS. However, with respect to our Commercial Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. There are, however, new safe harbors that protect certain value-based arrangements. We are assessing how these new safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. That said, we have carefully structured these arrangements in accordance with applicable guidance to be in compliance with the fraud and abuse laws, should they be subject to a case-by-case analysis in light of the intent of the parties and the overall potential for abuse.
If any of our business transactions or arrangements were found to violate the AKS, we could face, among other things, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price.
Stark Law
The Physician Self-Referral Law (commonly referred to as the Stark Law) prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing Designated Health Services (“DHS”) from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. Although uncertainty exists, federal agencies and at least one court have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid.
DHS is defined to include clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services, radiation therapy services and supplies, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing DHS that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” a DHS to another entity in which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute where unlawful intent need not be demonstrated.
If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the prohibition, a civil penalty of up to $25,820 for each service arising out of the 
15


prohibited referral, a civil penalty of up to $172,137 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law prohibition, civil assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and potential exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Amounts collected on claims related to prohibited referrals must be reported and refunded generally within 60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified. Furthermore, Stark Law violations and failure to return overpayments in a timely manner can form the basis for FCA liability, as discussed below.
Our episode of care programs involve a number of arrangements that potentially implicate the Stark Law because they may involve payments between a physician and an entity providing DHS in connection with Medicare patients, including risk sharing and gainsharing arrangements. With respect to BPCI-A and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of certain fraud and abuse laws, including the Stark Law. With respect to our Commercial Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. There are, however, new exceptions to the Stark Law that protect certain value-based arrangements. We are assessing how these new safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. That said, we have carefully structured these arrangements in accordance with applicable guidance to be in compliance with the fraud and abuse laws, should they be subject to a case-by-case analysis to ensure compliance with the Stark Law.
If CMS or other regulatory or enforcement authorities determine that claims have been submitted for referrals by us that violate the Stark Law, we would be subject to the penalties described above. In addition, it might be necessary to restructure existing compensation agreements with our doctors and nurse practitioners. Any such penalties and restructuring or other required actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In June 2018, the CMS issued a request for information seeking input on how to address any undue regulatory impact and burden of the Stark Law. CMS placed the request for information in the context of the Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care (“Regulatory Sprint”) discussed below and stated that it identified aspects of the Stark Law that pose potential barriers to coordinated care. CMS thus sought comments on the impact and burden of the Stark Law, including whether it prevents or inhibits care coordination. In October 2019, CMS issued a sweeping set of proposed regulations that introduced significant new value-based terminology and exceptions to the Stark Law. Effective January 19, 2021, CMS issued final Regulatory Sprint regulations that CMS indicates are designed to support the innovation necessary for a health care delivery and payment system that pays for value instead of volume. Among other things, these regulations establish new exceptions to the Stark Law that protect certain value-based arrangements. As the entire health care industry tries to evaluate the potential implications of the changes in these new regulations, we are evaluating their potential impacts on our business. 
The definition of DHS under the Stark Law does not include outpatient physician services. Since many services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided through our programs are outpatient physician services, our services do not always implicate the Stark Law referral prohibition. However, certain services we may provide, including certain diagnostic testing, may be considered DHS.
Fraud and abuse under state law
Some states have laws prohibiting physicians from having financial interests in or with healthcare facilities to which they refer patients. States also have laws similar to or stricter than the AKS that may affect our ability to enter into financial relationships with certain entities or individuals. Some state anti-kickback laws also include civil and criminal penalties. Some of these laws include exemptions that may be applicable to our physician relationships or for financial interests limited to shares of publicly traded stock. Some, however, may include no explicit exemption for certain types of agreements and/or relationships entered into with physicians. Such laws may be implicated if we expand our services to provide healthcare services directly, as opposed to the purely diagnostic and evaluative services we currently provide.
Similarly, states have beneficiary inducement prohibitions and consumer protection laws that may be triggered by the offering of inducements, incentives and other forms of remuneration to patients and prospective patients. Violations range from civil to criminal and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
16


The False Claims Act
The FCA is a means of policing false bills or false requests for payment in the healthcare delivery system. Among other things, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
•knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; 
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; 
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or 
•conspires to commit the above acts. 
In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. Under these provisions, within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a healthcare provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute. As a result of these provisions, our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments may be subject to greater scrutiny.
The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 (amounts not adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. On June 19, 2020, the Department of Justice issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties, under which the per claim penalty range increased to a range from $11,665 to $22,331 for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and intentionally reporting of inaccurate risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to Medicare Advantage plans. The ACA provides that claims tainted by a violation of the AKS are false for purposes of the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that we have violated the FCA could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition to the FCA, the various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police the same activities listed above, particularly with regard to Medicaid fee-for-service and Managed Medicaid programs.
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
17


The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
•presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare or other federal healthcare programs that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; 
•offering remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular healthcare provider; 
•arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal healthcare programs; 
•violating the AKS; 
•being involved in a hospital or a critical access hospital knowingly making a payment, directly or indirectly, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided with respect to Medicare or Medicaid patients who are under the direct care of the physician; 
•making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program; 
•making or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of healthcare services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program, including MAOs and entities that apply to participate as healthcare providers of services or suppliers in such managed care organizations and such plans; and 
•failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government. 
Our episodes of care programs involve a number of arrangements that potentially implicate aspects of the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute because they may involve payments intended to influence behavior of physicians relative to Medicare and other federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including risk sharing and gainsharing arrangements, that could be found to violate the AKS or the prohibition against hospitals making payments to physicians to reduce or limit medically necessary services. With respect to BPCI-A and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of certain fraud and abuse laws, including the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute. 
With respect to our Commercial Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. There are, however, new exceptions and safe harbors that are applicable to the Civil Monetary Penalties Statue that protect certain value-based arrangements. We are assessing how these new exceptions and safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. That said, we have carefully structured these arrangements in accordance with applicable guidance to be in compliance with the fraud and abuse laws, such arrangements are subject to a case-by-case analysis in light of the intent of the parties and the overall potential for abuse.
Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.
We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute would apply. We perform checks on our providers, our customers’ members, healthcare provider organizations, patients and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual become excluded and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual. Thus, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws
We are subject to various state laws and regulations that regulate the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. The corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits corporate entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians (and, in some cases, other providers) to provide professional medical services. The doctrine reflects a variety of historical public policy concerns, including concerns that (a) allowing corporations to practice medicine or employ physicians will result in the commercialization of the practice of medicine, (b) a corporation’s obligation to its shareholders may not align with a physician’s obligation to his/her patients and (c) employment of a physician by a corporation may interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment. While most (but not all) states have some form of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, the scope and enforcement varies widely. In those states where the doctrine exists, it typically arises from the state’s medical practice act, but has been shaped over the years by state statutes, regulations, court decisions, attorney general opinions and actions by state medical licensing boards.
Historically, the medical profession has recognized an ethical prohibition against physicians (and often other providers) paying professional peers and others for referrals. One form this has taken is the prohibition against fee splitting. Fee splitting occurs when a physician splits part of the professional fee earned from treating a referred patient in order to generate the referral. Among the public policy harms that have been cited in support of fee splitting prohibitions are (a) unnecessary operations and procedures, (b) incompetent specialists and (c) unnecessary medical services. Fee splitting prohibitions are aimed primarily at situations where a healthcare professional, in order to generate patient referrals from other licensed or unlicensed persons, splits part of the professional fee earned from treating the referred patient with the source of the referral. In response to legitimate concerns, states adopted prohibitions against fee splitting. Some of these prohibitions, however, reach far broader than necessary to deter this behavior and instead prohibit appropriate business relationships with entities that are not healthcare providers, such as billing agencies or management companies. States have taken a variety of legislative approaches to fee splitting, from near complete bans to bans with various exceptions to no prohibition at all. Depending on the approach that a particular state has taken, fee splitting laws may implicate a variety of otherwise legitimate activities such as management and billing companies.
Despite the existence of various state corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws, it is possible to develop legal structures that comply with these laws. The “captive” or “friendly” professional corporation model allows a legal entity (typically a professional corporation or professional limited liability company) whose shareholders are all physicians to employ the physicians (and other providers). The physician entity then contracts with a corporate entity referred to as a Management Services Organization, or “MSO,” to provide various management services. The physician entity is kept “friendly” through a stock transfer restriction agreement and/or other relationship between the MSO and the physician owners of the professional corporation. The fees under the management services arrangement must be carefully structured to comply with state fee splitting laws, which in some states may prohibit percentage-based fees.
Provider licensure and telehealth laws
We utilize the services of a variety of providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, pharmacists and nurses, among others. States generally require providers providing professional healthcare services, whether in person or via telehealth, to a patient residing within the state to be licensed in that state. States have established a variety of licensing and other regulatory requirements around the provision of telehealth services. States also require notification of certain material events be provided to licensing agencies. These licensure requirements vary from state to state. We have established systems for ensuring that our providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the providers as well as civil, criminal or administrative penalties against the providers and/or those engaging the services of the provider.
Privacy and security
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that are designed to protect the uses and disclosures of certain types of data. These include the federal regulations promulgated under the authority of HIPAA require us to 
19


provide certain protections to individuals and their health information. Further all 50 states and certain territories maintain additional laws regulating the privacy and security of PII. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of PHI and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers, and their business associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide individuals with substantive rights with respect to their health information.
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with our customers as the “covered entities” and our subcontractors, also known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities and business associates may be subject to penalties for, among other activities and compliance issues, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associates (including subcontractors) violating HIPAA. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations.
Covered entities must notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach, and such timelines are generally shortened under state law obligations and standard practice when possible. If a business associate is acting as an agent of a covered entity, then the covered entity must provide the required notifications to individuals based on the time when the business associate discovered the breach. Reporting must also be made to the HHS OCR and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. Generally impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and the state regulators in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised.
Violations of HIPAA by entities like us, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations have widely ranged, with larger breaches for some organizations ranging from a couple million dollars to a $16 million penalty for one breach. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to enforce the law on behalf of their residents. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging noncompliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI. States attorneys general may also negotiate settlements for related cases and on behalf of their respective residents.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, creation, receipt, transmission, storage, and other processing of PHI and PII. Privacy and data security statutes and regulations vary from state to state, and these laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its implementing rules. These laws and regulations include 42 C.F.R. Part 2, including the CCPA, and a range of other laws that protect data pertaining to specific conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, genetic disorders, and mental and behavioral health. The requirements of the CCPA are potentially far-reaching and may require us to modify certain policies and practices regarding the collection, use, processing and sharing of certain personal information. Privacy and data security laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory and subject to change or differing interpretations. The complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection and information security creates significant compliance challenges for us, potentially restricts our ability to collect, use and disclose data, and exposes us to additional expense, and, if we cannot comply with applicable laws in a timely manner or at all, adverse publicity, harm to our reputation, and liability.
Telecommunications and telemarketing laws
20


We are subject to a variety of federal and state laws that regulate telecommunications and telemarketing activities, including the following.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) places restrictions on making certain telemarketing calls, non-telemarketing calls, faxes, and SMS text messages to consumers. Prior express consent of consumers may be required to override certain activities prohibited under the TCPA. The scope and interpretation of the TCPA, and other laws that are or may be applicable to making calls and delivering SMS text messages to consumers, are continuously evolving and developing. TCPA violations may be subject to penalties of $500 per violation and $1,500 for each willful or knowing violation. Recent expansion of the law through the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (“TRACED”) Act expanded the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 per call for intentional violations of federal robocall laws and increased the time period that the FCC can take action to against those who intentionally violate federal law to four years. This penalty is in addition to other penalties for TCPA violations.
The CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial email messages. It prohibits the inclusion of deceptive or misleading information and subject headings and requires identifying information such as a return address in email messages. The CAN-SPAM Act also specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that do not comply with certain requirements, such as providing an opt-out mechanism for stopping future emails from senders.
Healthcare reform
In March 2010, broad healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the ACA. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both commercial and government payors and contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations. Although many of the provisions of the ACA did not take effect immediately and continue to be implemented, and some have been and may be modified before or during their implementation, the reforms could continue to have an impact on our business in a number of ways. We cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to federal and state healthcare reform legislation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future.
Other aspects of the ACA may also affect our business, including provisions that impact the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These and other provisions of the ACA remain subject to ongoing uncertainty due to administrative actions and executive orders during the current Administration, as well as continuing political and legal challenges at both the federal and state levels. Since 2016, various administrative and legislative initiatives have been implemented that have had adverse impacts on the ACA and its programs. For example, in October 2017, the federal government announced that cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers would end, effective immediately, unless Congress appropriated the funds, and, in December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes a provision that reduces to $0 the penalty under the ACA’s individual mandate for individuals who fail to obtain a qualifying health insurance plan and could impact the future state of the exchanges. Moreover, in February 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act (the “BBA”) which, among other things, repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board that was established by the ACA and intended to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending by extending sequestration cuts to Medicare payments through fiscal year 2027. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, included a temporary suspension of the 2% sequestration cuts from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, extended the temporary suspension through March 31, 2021. The CARES Act also postponed the sunset of sequestration as it applies to Medicare to the end of 2030. The BBA also included provisions to expand the scope of benefits that Medicare Advantage plans may offer for certain chronically ill federal healthcare program beneficiaries beginning in 2020. Medicare Advantage plans now have the flexibility to target non-primarily health-related supplemental benefits to beneficiaries with chronic illnesses and to address social and environmental factors that may impact beneficiary health.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the prior Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the TCJA includes a provision reducing to $0, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the

Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was modified under the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, and the Court held oral argument on November 10, 2020. The case is expected to be decided by June 2021. Through Executive Orders issued on January 28, 2021 and other actions, the new administration has signaled its strong support for the Affordable Care Act. It has taken steps to reverse various actions by the prior administration in an effort to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. At this time, we cannot predict the effect on our business of the ultimate decision by the Supreme Court regarding the Affordable Care Act or future action by the administration and/or Congress with respect to the Affordable Care Act and other aspects of the healthcare system.
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future with respect to the exchanges and other core aspects of the current health care marketplace. Future elections may create conditions for Congress to adopt new federal coverage programs that may disrupt our current revenue streams both from payors and other government programs. It is possible that future changes could lower our reimbursement rates or increase our expenses. Any failure to successfully implement strategic initiatives that respond to future legislative, regulatory, and executive changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The CMS and state Medicaid agencies also routinely adjust the RAF which is central to payment under Medicare Advantage programs in which our customers participate. The monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that our customers manage in their member populations are subject to change by the CMS and state agencies. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care
In an effort to help accelerate the transformation of the U.S. healthcare system from a fee-for-service to a value-based system, HHS launched its Regulatory Sprint initiative in 2018. The effort encompasses a number of federal statutes and regulations, including:
•Stark Law 
•AKS 
•Civil Monetary Penalties Statute 
•Privacy and Security of Health Information 
As part of HHS’s Regulatory Sprint, the OIG issued a request for information in August 2018 seeking input on regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. Specifically, the OIG sought to identify ways in which it might modify or add new safe harbors to the AKS as well as exceptions to the definition of “remuneration” in the beneficiary inducements provision of the Civil Monetary Penalty statute in order to foster arrangements that promote care coordination and advance the delivery of value-based care, while also protecting against harms caused by fraud and abuse. Numerous federal agencies have requested comments and information from the public and have published proposed regulations as part of the Regulatory Sprint on areas that have historically been viewed as barriers to innovative care coordination arrangements. 
The OIG and CMS each issued a sweeping set of proposed regulations that introduce significant new value-based terminology, safe harbors and exceptions to the AKS and the Stark Law and took steps to modernize the Civil Monetary Penalty statue governing inducements provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Effective January 29, 2021, the OIG and CMS issued final Regulatory Sprint regulations designed to support the innovation necessary for a health care delivery and payments system that pays for value instead of volume. These regulations establish new safe harbors and exceptions to the AKS and the Stark Law as well as exceptions to the definition of “remuneration” in the beneficiary inducement provision of the Civil Monetary Penalty statue. Among other things, these new regulations are designed to provide protection to certain value-based arrangements. As the entire health 
22


care industry tires to evaluate the potential implication of the changes in these new regulations, we are evaluating their potential impacts on our business. The OCR is also involved, and has called for information from the public regarding ways that the HIPAA regulations could be modernized to support coordinated, value-based care.
Similarly, the OCR has requested information from the public regarding ways that the HIPAA regulations could be modernized to support coordinated, value-based care. On December 10, the OCR issued proposed regulations to reduce the burden on providers and support new ways to innovate and coordinate care on behalf of patients, while uphold HIPAA’s privacy and security goals. The new Administration has extended the comment period for the proposed regulation until May 6, 2021, which may signal interest in the updating of the regulations. Nevertheless, the contents and timing of any final regulations remains uncertain. 
Further, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (“SAMHSA”) published proposed regulations related to the privacy of substance use disorder treatment records, and the CMS published proposals to revise its Stark advisory opinion process. On July 15, 2020, SAMHSA issued a final rule on the protection of substance use disorder (“SUD”) treatment records under 42 C.F.R. Part 2 (the “Part 2 Rule”). The Part 2 final rule aims to reduce delays and burdens in care coordination by more closely aligning Part 2 with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, while maintaining certain privacy protections specific to Part 2. This final rule became effective August 14, 2020. Also of note, under the CARES Act Congress itself made significant modifications to the authorizing statute for the Part 2 regulations, with the aim of aligning the Part 2 laws more strongly with the HIPAA privacy rule. The law directs the Secretary of HHS to revise the Part 2 regulations such that the amendments would apply to uses and disclosures of SUD records the date that is 12 months after the date of enactment of the CARES Act.
These changes in federal regulations are anticipated to have a significant impact on healthcare providers and other stakeholders. In addition, we anticipate that additional changes will continue to be proposed in the future. Many of the solutions we offer in our Episodes of Care Services segment focus on encouraging collaboration among provider partners and the sharing of accountability in order to improve medical outcomes. As a result, these changes could have a material effect on our business. 
Other regulations
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.
Federal and state law also governs the dispensing of controlled substances by physicians. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Any allegations or findings that we or our provider partners have violated any of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Employees and Human Capital
Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,200 employees, of which approximately 2,100 employees were full time. Our employees are based primarily at our offices located in Norwalk, CT, Dallas, TX, New York, NY and Rapid City, SD. We also had approximately 9,000 credentialed physicians and nurse practitioners and other providers within our mobile network that we contract with on an independent contractor basis, either directly or through captive professional affiliates. These credentialed physicians and nurse practitioners form a mobile network of practitioners located all over the country. We consider our relationship with our independent contractors and employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.

Initial Public Offering and Internal Reorganization
On February 16, 2021, Signify Health closed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 27,025,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at an offering price of $24.00 per share for net proceeds of $609.7 million. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on February 11, 2021.
Signify Health, which was incorporated in the state of Delaware on October 1, 2020, was formed for the purpose of completing the IPO and related transactions in order to carry on the business of Cure TopCo, LLC (“Cure TopCo”) as a publicly-traded entity. In connection with the IPO, Signify Health and Cure TopCo entered into a series of transactions to implement an internal reorganization (the “Reorganization Transactions”) as follows:
•Signify Health’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock (collectively, our “common stock”); 
•Cure TopCo entered into the Amended LLC Agreement to, among other things, appoint Signify Health as the sole managing member of Cure TopCo and to modify Cure TopCo’s capital structure to reclassify the equity interests into a single class of LLC units (the “LLC Units”). Under the Amended LLC Agreement, holders of LLC Units (other than us and our wholly owned subsidiaries), including each Pre-IPO LLC Member who retained its equity ownership in Cure TopCo in the form of LLC Units immediately following the Reorganization Transactions (each a “Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Member”), have the right (subject to the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement), to require Cure TopCo to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Units for, at our election, newly issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the volume-weighted average market price of one share of our Class A common stock for each LLC Unit redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications) in accordance with the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement. Additionally, in the event 
24


of a redemption request from a holder of LLC Units, we may, at our option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A common stock for LLC Units in lieu of such a redemption. Shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled on a one-for-one basis if we, following a redemption request from a holder of LLC Units, redeem or exchange LLC Units of such holder pursuant to the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement. Except for transfers to us or to certain permitted transferees pursuant to the Amended LLC Agreement, the LLC Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of;
•Signify Health acquired, directly and indirectly, LLC Units through (i) the contribution of LLC Units in exchange for shares of Class A common stock by New Mountain Partners V (AIV-C), LP (the “IPO Contribution”) and (ii) the “Mergers,” in which certain entities treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes that held LLC Units (individually, a “Blocker Company” and together, the “Blocker Companies”) each simultaneously merged with a merger subsidiary created by us (and survived such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Signify Health), after which each Blocker Company immediately merged into Signify Health (with each such merger into Signify Health having occurred simultaneously); 
•Each Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Member was issued a number of shares of our Class B common stock equal to the number of LLC Units held by such Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Member, except in the case of Cure Aggregator, LLC (“Cure Aggregator”). Cure Aggregator is a special purpose investment vehicle through which certain members of Cure TopCo, primarily our employees and certain legacy investors, indirectly hold interests in Cure TopCo. Cure Aggregator holds LLC Units on behalf of such members on a one-for-one basis with each member’s interests in Cure Aggregator. Such common units in Cure Aggregator are subject to vesting as set forth under “Item 11. Executive Compensation—Other compensation plans—Incentive Units.” In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, shares of Class B common stock were issued to the direct holders of common units in Cure Aggregator in proportion to their interests in Cure Aggregator, provided that such shares are not entitled to any voting rights until such time as the common units of Cure Aggregator corresponding to such shares have vested; 
•We used all of the net proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued LLC Units from Cure TopCo at a purchase price per LLC Unit equal to the initial public offering price of Class A common stock, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions;
•We entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement that obligates us to make payments to the Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Members, the shareholders of the Blocker Companies, Optionholders (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) of the Blocker Companies at the time of the Mergers, holders of synthetic equity units and any future party to the Tax Receivable Agreement (collectively, the “TRA Parties”) in the aggregate generally equal to 85% of the applicable cash savings that we actually realize as a result of (i) certain favorable tax attributes acquired from the Blocker Companies in the Mergers (including net operating losses, the Blocker Companies’ allocable share of existing tax basis and refunds of Blocker Company taxes attributable to pre-Merger tax periods), (ii) increases in our allocable share of existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments that may result from (x) future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units by Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Members for cash or Class A common stock, (y) the IPO Contribution and (z) certain payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iii) deductions in respect of interest and certain compensatory payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these tax savings;
•We caused Cure TopCo to use the proceeds from the issuance of LLC Units to us (i) to pay fees and expenses of approximately $13.5 million in connection with the IPO and the Reorganization Transactions and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including working capital and potential strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses or technologies that we believe will complement our current business and expansion strategies; and
25



•We entered into the stockholders’ agreement with certain Pre-IPO LLC Members.
Effects of the Reorganization on our Corporate Structure
Signify Health was formed for the purpose of the IPO and has engaged to date only in activities relating to the business and operations of Cure TopCo. Signify Health is a holding company and its sole material asset is a controlling ownership and economic interest in Cure TopCo. All of our business is conducted through Cure TopCo and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, and the financial results of Cure TopCo and its consolidated subsidiaries will be included in the consolidated financial statements of Signify Health for periods subsequent to the effective date of the reorganization.
Cure TopCo is currently taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including Signify Health, pay taxes with respect to their allocable share of its net taxable income. We expect that redemptions and exchanges of LLC Units will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the tangible and intangible assets of Cure TopCo that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The Tax Receivable Agreement requires Signify Health to pay to the TRA Parties 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize from the tax basis increase and other tax attributes discussed herein. Furthermore, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will give rise to additional tax benefits and therefore additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
