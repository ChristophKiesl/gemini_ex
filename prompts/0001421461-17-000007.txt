ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
We are the only producer of potash in the United States and we are one of two producers of langbeinite, which we market and sell as Trio®. Potash, or "muriate of potash" or "potassium chloride," is used as a fertilizer in agricultural markets worldwide. Potash is also used in oil and gas drilling and stimulation fluids and in animal feed. Langbeinite is a low-chloride potassium fertilizer that also contains sulfate and magnesium that is used primarily in magnesium and sulfur deficient soils and on crops that need a low-chloride source of potassium such as citrus, vegetable, sugarcane and palm. It is also used as an animal feed supplement.
Under the terms of our senior notes (the "Notes"), in December 2016 we engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., a nationally-recognized investment bank, to assess, evaluate, and assist in pursuing potential strategic alternatives available to us, as we determine to be appropriate. These potential strategic alternatives could include, but are not limited to, continuing our current operating plan, equity offerings or balance sheet restructurings, merger and acquisition opportunities, partnership or joint venture opportunities, entering into new or complementary businesses, or a sale of Intrepid or some or all of our assets. This evaluation is ongoing.
Our principal offices are located at 707 17th Street, Suite 4200, Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (303) 296-3006. Intrepid was incorporated in 2007. 
Our Products and Markets
Our two primary products are potash and Trio®. Potash and Trio® sales as a percentage of total sales were as follows for the last three years:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Potash | 76 | % | | 77 | % | 83 | %
Trio® | 24 | % | | 23 | % | 17 | %

Prior to the second quarter of 2016, we had one reporting segment; the extraction, production, and sale of potassium-related products. As a result of pricing pressure and the resulting economic factors giving rise to the conversion of our East facility to Trio®-only and the idling of our West facility, the chief operating decision maker separately evaluates our potash and Trio® operations. Accordingly, we reevaluated our segments and determined that, beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we have two segments: potash and Trio®. Our extraction and production operations are conducted entirely in the continental United States. Financial information about our segments, including sales and gross margin (deficit) by segment, for the last three years is included in Note 16 — Business Segments to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." We do not present total assets by segment as our chief operating decision maker does not review or otherwise regularly receive this information.
Potash
We sell potash into three primary markets: the agricultural market as a fertilizer input, the industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells and an input to other industrial processes, and the animal feed market as a nutrient supplement. Potash is sold in different product sizes, such as granular, standard, and fine standard. The agricultural market predominately uses granular-sized potash, while the industrial and animal feed markets mostly use standard- and fine standard-sized product. We have the flexibility to produce all of our product in a granular form decreasing our dependence on sales of any one particular size of potash. 
We manage sales and marketing operations centrally. We evaluate our customers' potash needs to determine which of our production facilities is best suited, typically based on geographic location, to fill sales orders with the objective of realizing the highest average net realized sales price per ton. 
Average net realized sales price per ton is a non-GAAP measure that we calculate as sales less freight costs divided by sales tons. From 2005 through 2016, we supplied, on average, 1.5% of annual world potassium consumption and 9.1% of annual U.S. potassium consumption.
Many of our potash sales are geographically concentrated in the central and western United States. Fertilizer sales are affected by weather and planting conditions in these regions, as well as farmer economics. A significant portion of our industrial sales are derived from oil and gas customers and correlate to drilling rig counts in specific regions in the United States.

Trio® 
Trio® is our specialty fertilizer that delivers potassium, sulfate and magnesium in a single particle and has the added benefit of being low in chloride. This unique combination of nutrients makes Trio® an attractive fertilizer across diverse crops and geographies. We produce Trio® in premium, granular, standard, and fine standard sizes for sale both domestically and internationally. 
By-products and Other Products
We produce salt, magnesium chloride, metal recovery salts and brine containing salt and potassium from our mining processes. Our salt is used in a variety of markets including animal feed, industrial applications, pool salt, and the treatment of roads and walkways for ice melting or to manage road conditions. It is also sold as a nutrient supplement in animal feed and for use in other industrial processes. Magnesium chloride is typically used as a road treatment agent for both deicing and dedusting. Our brines are used primarily by the oil and gas industry to support well development and completion activities. The sales of these by-products are accounted for as by-product credits to our cost of sales. In 2016, substantially all of our by‑product sales were accounted for in the potash segment. We also have water rights in New Mexico and Utah under which we sell water primarily for industrial uses such as in the oil and gas services industry.
We are in the process of implementing or considering a number of initiatives designed to maximize the value of our assets and expand sales of our by-products and water, particularly to service the oil and gas markets near our operating plants. In addition, we may enter into new or complementary businesses that expand our product offerings beyond our existing products. For example, we may expand into oil, natural gas, or other commodities or into products or services in our current or new industries. 
Production Facilities
We produce potash from three solar evaporation solution mining facilities: our HB solution mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, a solution mine in Moab, Utah, and a brine recovery mine in Wendover, Utah. We also operate our North compaction facility in Carlsbad, New Mexico, which compacts and granulates product from the HB mine. Solution mining is a process by which potash is extracted from mineralized beds by injecting a salt-saturated brine into a potash ore body and recovering a brine that contains potash and other minerals. The brine is brought to the surface for mineral recovery through solar evaporation. For solar evaporation, the brine is placed in ponds and solar energy is used to evaporate water thus crystallizing out the potash and minerals contained in the brine. The resulting mineral evaporates are then processed to separate the minerals for sale. Solution mining does not require employees or machines to be underground.
We produce Trio® from our conventional underground East mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico. A conventional underground mine uses a mechanical method of extracting minerals from underground. Underground mining consists of multiple shafts or entry points and a network of tunnels to provide access to minerals and conveyance systems to transport materials to the surface. Underground mining machines are used to remove the ore and a series of pillars are left behind to provide the appropriate level of ground support to ensure safe access and mining.
Until mid-2016, we also produced potash from our East and West mines in Carlsbad, New Mexico. In April 2016, we converted our East facility from a mixed-ore facility that produced both potash and Trio® to a Trio®-only facility. In addition, in early July 2016, we idled operations at our West facility and transitioned the facility into care and maintenance. These changes were designed to increase our production of Trio®, a product that had traditionally shown more resilience to pricing pressure than potash, and to lower costs in a time of declining potash prices.
We have a current estimated annual designed productive capacity of approximately 390,000 tons of potash from our solar evaporation solution mines. We also have an estimated annual designed productive capacity of 400,000 tons of Trio®.
Our annual production rates for potash and Trio® are less than our estimated productive capacity. Actual production is affected by operating rates, the grade of ore mined, recoveries, mining rates, evaporation rates, product pricing, and the amount of development work that we perform. Therefore, as with other producers in our industry, our production results tend to be lower than reported productive capacity. 
Industry Overview
Fertilizer serves a fundamental role in global agriculture by providing essential crop nutrients that help sustain both the yield and the quality of crops. The three primary nutrients required for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium. There are no known substitutes for these nutrients. A proper balance of each of the three nutrients is necessary to maximize their effectiveness. Potassium helps regulate plants' physiological functions and improves plant durability, providing crops with protection from drought, disease, parasites, and cold weather. Unlike nitrogen and phosphate, the potassium contained in naturally occurring potash does not require additional chemical conversion to be used as a plant nutrient.
 3

In addition to the primary nutrients, which are required in the greatest quantities in crop nutrition, important secondary nutrients such as sulfur and magnesium are also essential in crop nutrition. Intrepid's Trio® product contains the primary nutrient potassium and two secondary nutrients in its sulfur and magnesium content. 
Long-term global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth and global economic conditions with annual demand variations based on planted acreage, agricultural commodity yields and prices, inventories of grains and oilseeds, application rates of fertilizer, weather patterns, and farm sector income. We expect these key variables to continue to have an impact on global fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Sustained per capita income growth and agricultural policies in the developing world also affect global demand for fertilizer. Fertilizer demand is affected by other geopolitical factors such as temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention and changes in the buying patterns of key consuming countries. Volatility in agricultural commodity prices also may impact farmer fertilizer buying decisions.
Industry experts continue to forecast increasing potash consumption rates as world population grows. However, significant additional capacity has been added over the last few years by existing potash producers. In addition, there are numerous brownfield and greenfield expansions that have been financed or are nearing completion. This trend is particularly evident in North America. Despite this additional capacity, a significant portion of it remains idled as large producers took actions in 2016 as they worked to match supply to demand. We expect North American production capacity to increase again in 2017 with the completion of the first phase of a large greenfield project adding 2 million tons of capacity, as well as a brownfield expansion adding approximately 3.6 million tons of capacity. The combination of future production additions and currently idled production is expected to total nearly half of the current annual North American demand by the end of 2017. While a portion of these additional tons will likely be slated for export markets, the trend of decreasing utilization rates for North American producers appears inevitable and is expected to limit any upside on pricing for the foreseeable future. Imports could put additional pressure on the North American market as a strong U.S. dollar and lower international transportation costs making this an attractive market for foreign competitors.
Virtually all of the world's potash is currently extracted from approximately 19 commercial deposits. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association and data published by potash mining companies, six countries accounted for approximately 87% of the world's aggregate potash production during 2015. During this time period, the top nine potash producers supplied approximately 94% of world production. The three major Canadian producers participate in the Canpotex marketing group that supplied approximately 28% of the global potash production in 2015, one producer in Russia supplied approximately 17% of global production and one producer in Belarus supplied approximately 15%. 
Competition and Competitive Strategy
We sell into commodity markets and compete based on delivered price, our ability to deliver product in a timely manner, and product quality. We also compete based on the durability, particle size, and potassium oxide content of our products. For potash, we compete primarily with much larger potash producers, principally Canadian producers and, to a lesser extent, producers located in Russia, Belarus, Chile, Germany, and Israel. For Trio®, we compete with one other producer of langbeinite as well as producers of other specialty nutrients.
Our competitive strategy is focused on the following:

• | Expanding Trio® sales. Over the long term, we believe demand for Trio® will exceed supply, providing an opportunity to increase our gross margin. In light of this opportunity, in mid-2016, we transitioned our East facility to a Trio®-only facility, which significantly increased our production rate and our effective production capacity for Trio®. We continue our efforts to expand our sales and marketing efforts for Trio®, particularly internationally. We operate our East facility at production levels that approximate demand and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.


• | Maximize potash margin. In 2016, we idled potash production at our West and East conventional mines due in part to declining potash pricing. As a result, all of our potash production now comes from solar solution mines, which carry a lower cost structure than our previous conventional potash mines. With our lower cost structure and lower production, we are able to selectively participate in the markets that provide the highest average net realized sales price per ton. We have the advantage of being located close to the markets we serve, and the North American market is significantly larger than our production capacity. We also attempt to maximize our gross margin by leveraging our freight advantage to key geographies, our diverse customer and market base, and our flexible marketing approach.


• | Expand marketing and sales of by-products and other products. We are in the process of implementing or considering a number of initiatives designed to maximize the value of our existing assets, such as increased production and sales of salt, water, and brine. In addition, we may enter into new or complementary businesses

 4

that expand our product offerings beyond our existing assets or products. For example, we may expand into oil, natural gas, or other commodities or into products or services in our current or new industries. 

• | Optimize potash production. We have optimization and expansion opportunities at our solution mining facilities that, over time, could reduce our per-ton costs and increase our potash production. For example, we have potential expansion opportunities at our HB mine. Our per-ton costs are lower for solution mining than conventional mining as solution mining requires less labor, energy, and equipment. In addition, if potash prices increase significantly, we could restart potash production at our West mine.


• | Evaluate strategic alternatives. Under the terms of our senior notes, in December 2016 we engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., a nationally-recognized investment bank, to assess, evaluate, and assist in pursuing potential strategic alternatives available to us, as we determine to be appropriate. These potential strategic alternatives could include, but are not limited to, continuing our current operating plan, equity offerings or balance sheet restructurings, merger and acquisition opportunities, partnership or joint venture opportunities, entering into new or complementary businesses, or a sale of Intrepid or some or all of our assets. This evaluation is ongoing.

Competitive Strengths

• | U.S.-based producer. We are the only producer of potash in the United States. We are located in a market that consumes significantly more potash than we can produce on an annual basis. Our geographic location provides us with a transportation advantage over our competitors for shipping our product to our customers. In general, this allows us to obtain a higher average net realized sales price per ton than our competitors, who must ship their products across longer distances to consuming markets, which are often export markets. Our location allows us to target sales to the markets in which we have the greatest transportation advantage, maximizing our average net realized sales price per ton. Our access to strategic rail destination points and our location along major agricultural trucking routes support this advantage.

As a U.S. producer, we enjoy a significantly lower total production tax and royalty burden than our principal competitors, which operate primarily in Saskatchewan, Canada. The Saskatchewan tax system for potash producers includes a capital tax and several potash mineral taxes, none of which are imposed on us as a U.S. producer. We currently pay an average royalty rate of approximately 4.2% of our sales less freight costs, which compares favorably to that of our competitors in Canada. The relative tax and royalty advantage for U.S. producers becomes more pronounced when profits per ton increase due primarily to the profit tax component of the Saskatchewan potash mineral tax. 

• | Solar evaporation operations. The HB mine, located in the New Mexico desert, the Moab mine and the Wendover facility, both located in the Utah desert, use solar evaporation to crystallize potash from brines. Solar evaporation is a cost efficient production method because it significantly reduces our labor and energy consumption, which are two of the largest costs of production. Our understanding and application of low cost solution mining, combined with our reserves being located where a favorable climate for evaporation exists, make solar solution mining difficult for other producers to replicate. We also have significant reserves for future expansion of our solution mining operations.


• | Participation in specialty markets. Given the greater scarcity of langbeinite relative to potash and its agronomic suitability for certain soils and crops, we believe there is a market for Trio® outside of our core potash markets. We also believe that there is a market for Trio® beyond the United States, and we are working to capture and grow this market. Through our existing operations and assets, we also have the potential to grow our offerings of salt, water, and brine with low capital investments.


• | Diversity of potash markets. We sell potash into three different markets—the agricultural, industrial, and feed markets. During 2016, these markets represented approximately 89%, 5%, and 6% of our potash sales, respectively. The agricultural market supplies farmers producing a wide range of crops in different geographies. In addition, based on our geographic proximity to increased activity in the oil and gas sector, we believe we have an opportunity to increase our industrial sales volumes to more historical percentages of our total volume.


• | Marketing flexibility. We have the ability to convert all of our standard-sized potash product into granular-sized product as market conditions warrant. This also provides us with increased marketing flexibility as well as decreased dependence on any one particular market.


• | Significant reserve life and water rights. Our potash and langbeinite reserves each have substantial years of reserve life, with remaining reserve lives ranging from 16 years to greater than 100 years, based on proven and

 5

probable reserve estimates. In addition to our reserves, we have water rights and access to additional mineralized areas of potash for potential future exploitation. 

• | Existing facilities and infrastructure. Constructing a new potash production facility requires substantial time and extensive capital investment in mining, milling, and infrastructure to process, store and ship product. Our operating facilities already have significant facilities and infrastructure in place. We also have the ability to expand our business using existing installed infrastructure, in less time and with lower expenditures than would be required to construct entirely new mines. In addition, if potash prices significantly increase, we could restart potash production at our West mine, which has been in care-and-maintenance mode since mid-2016.

Seasonality
The sales pattern for potash sold into the agricultural market is seasonal. Over the last three years, our monthly potash sales volume is highest in January through April and September through October when purchasers are looking to have product on hand in advance of the spring and fall application seasons in the United States. Our monthly sales volume has been the lowest in November and December. 
The sales pattern for Trio® sold into the domestic agricultural market is also seasonal. Over the last three years, our Trio® sales volume is highest in March and April, as Trio® products are typically applied to crops in the United States during the spring planting season. As we expand our Trio® sales efforts outside of the United States, we expect the seasonality of our Trio® sales to be impacted by the regions of the world where those products are delivered. 
The month-to-month seasonality of our agricultural sales is somewhat moderated due to the variety of crops, industries, distribution strategies and geographies that we serve. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, all of our potash production now comes from our solution mines. As a result, our potash production will have more seasonality than it has been historically. Our solar solution mines suspend potash production activities from early spring through late summer, the peak solar evaporation period. Accordingly, we manage our inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons, as well as during the summer evaporation period when we have no potash being produced. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and revenue being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just before the start of the spring season. We have observed fertilizer dealers in North America instituting practices that are designed to reduce their risk of changes in the price of fertilizer products through consignment-type programs. These programs tend to make the timing of the spring and fall seasonal demand profile less predictable within the season. Further, through technological advances, the farmers in the United States have gained efficiencies in planting and harvesting their crops, which has compressed the application seasons.
Our quarterly financial results can also vary from one year to the next due to weather‑related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. 
International Sales
 Due to the transition of our East facility to Trio®-only, we have increased our production of Trio® over the past year. We continue our efforts to expand our sales and marketing efforts for this product, particularly internationally. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 our sales of both potash and Trio® attributed to the U.S. were $206.8 million, $278.5 million, and $401.2 million, respectively; while international sales were $4.1 million, $8.7 million, and $9.1 million, respectively. More information about our Trio® sales is included in "Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," under the heading "Trio® Segment Results." 
There are risks associated with international sales as described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the headings "We are working to expand our international sales of Trio®, and our sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in our plans" and "International sales could present risks to our business."
All of our long-lived assets are in the U.S. 
Major Customers
Within the agricultural market, we supply a diversified customer base of distributors, cooperatives, retailers, and dealers, which in turn supply farmers producing a wide range of crops in different geographies. Servicing the industrial and feed markets provides us with a customer base that is unrelated to agricultural markets.
In each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales.

Environmental, Safety, and Health Matters
We are subject to an evolving set of federal, state, and local environmental, safety, and health laws that regulate (1) soil, air, and water quality standards for our facilities; (2) disposal, storage, and management of hazardous and solid wastes; (3) post-mining land reclamation and closure; (4) conditions of mining and production operations; (5) employee and contractor safety and occupational health; and (6) product content and labeling. We employ and consult with professionals who assist in monitoring our compliance with these laws and who work with management to ensure that appropriate strategies and processes are in place to promote a culture that prioritizes safety and environmental responsibility.
In 2016, we had approximately $1 million of capital investments, and $0.3 million in other expenses, relating to environmental compliance, environmental studies, and remediation efforts. We expect to have a similar level of expenditures in 2017. However, future capital expenditures are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes to environmental regulations and interpretations, and enforcement initiatives. If potential negative effects to the environment are discovered, or if the potential negative effects are of a greater magnitude than currently estimated, material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the identified effects. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our operations.
Product Registration Requirements
We are required to register fertilizer products with each U.S. state and foreign country where products are sold. Each brand and grade of commercial fertilizer must be registered with the appropriate state agency before being offered for sale, sold, or distributed in that jurisdiction. In most cases, these product registrations impose specific requirements relating to guaranteed analysis, product labeling, and regular reporting of sales.
Some states require similar registration and reporting for feed grade products. Industrial-grade products typically do not require registration or reporting.
Operating Requirements and Government Regulations
Permits
We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regarding land use and reclamation; release of emissions to the atmosphere or water; plant and animal life; and the generation, treatment, storage, disposal, and handling of hazardous substances and wastes. These laws include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"); the Toxic Substances Control Act; and various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution‑control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released, disposed of, or arranged for release or disposal of hazardous substances in the environment.
We hold numerous environmental, mining, and other permits or approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. Our operations are subject to permits for, among other things, extraction of salt and brine, discharges of process materials and waste to air and surface water, and injection of brine. Some of our proposed activities may require waste storage permits. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could limit or prevent us from mining at these properties. In addition, changes to environmental and mining regulations or permit requirements could limit our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. In many cases, environmental permits and approvals are also required for an expansion of, or changes to, our operations. As a condition to procuring the necessary permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate reclamation, closure, and post-closure care at our facilities. We obtain bonds as financial assurance for these obligations. These bonds require annual payment and renewal.
We believe we are in compliance with existing regulatory programs, permits, and approvals where non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition, except as follows. In 2016, the New Mexico Office of State Engineer ("OSE") determined that our East and West tailing impoundment embankments are considered jurisdictional dams. We continue to work with the OSE to determine required dam modifications associated with this determination. We may be required to spend a significant amount of capital to bring the impoundments into compliance with requirements for jurisdictional dams or modify our operations to no longer use impoundments that may qualify as jurisdictional.
From time to time, we have received notices from governmental agencies that we are not in compliance with certain environmental laws, regulations, permits, or approvals. For example, although designated as zero discharge facilities under the 
 7

applicable water quality laws and regulations, our East, North, and Moab facilities at times may experience some water discharges during periods of significant rainfall. We have implemented several initiatives to address discharge issues, including the reconstruction or modification of certain impoundments, increasing evaporation, and reducing process water usage and discharges and improved management systems. State and federal officials are aware of these issues and have visited the sites to review our corrective efforts and action plans. 
Air Emissions
In the ordinary course of our business, from time to time, we receive notices from the New Mexico Environment Department of alleged air quality control violations. Upon receipt of these notices, we promptly evaluate the matter and take any required corrective actions. In some cases, we may be required to pay civil penalties for these notices of violation. 
Safety and Health Regulation and Programs
Certain of our facilities are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, related state statutes and regulations, or a combination of these laws.
The Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") is the governing agency for our conventional underground mines and related surface facilities in New Mexico. As required by MSHA, these operations are regularly inspected by MSHA personnel. Item 4 and Exhibit 95 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K provide information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K.
Our New Mexico facilities participate in MSHA's Region 8 "Partnership Program." There is a formally signed document and plan, pursuant to which each party commits to specific actions and behaviors. Examples of principles include working for an open, cooperative environment; agreeing to citation and conflict processes; and improving training. Our New Mexico facilities are serviced by a trained mine rescue team, which is ready to respond to on-site incidents or assist in local incidents, if needed. The team practices and participates at state and federal events and competitions. In addition, our New Mexico facilities participate in a basin agreement with other natural resource and hazardous waste facilities to provide mine rescue support.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") is the governing agency relating to the safety standards at our Utah facilities, as well as our HB mine and plant. Training and other certifications are provided to employees as needed based upon their work duties.
Remediation at Intrepid Facilities
Many of our current facilities have been in operation for a number of years. Operations by us and our predecessors have involved the historical use and handling of potash, salt, related potash and salt by-products, process tailings, hydrocarbons and other regulated substances. Some of these operations resulted, or may have resulted, in soil, surface water, or groundwater contamination. At some locations, there are areas where process waste, building materials (including asbestos‑containing transite), and ordinary trash may have been disposed or buried, and have since been closed and covered with soil and other materials.
At many of these facilities, spills or other releases of regulated substances may have occurred previously and potentially could occur at any of our facilities in the future, possibly requiring us to undertake or fund cleanup efforts under CERCLA or state laws governing cleanup or disposal of hazardous and solid waste substances.
We work closely with governmental authorities to obtain the appropriate permits to address identified site conditions. For example, buildings located at our facilities in both Utah and New Mexico have a type of siding that contains asbestos. We have adopted programs to encapsulate and stabilize portions of the siding through use of an adhesive spray and to remove the siding, replacing it with an asbestos-free material. Also, we have trained asbestos abatement crews that handle and dispose of the asbestos‑containing siding and related materials. We have a permitted asbestos landfill in Utah. We have worked closely with Utah officials to address asbestos‑related issues at our Moab mine.

Reclamation Obligations
Mining and processing of potash generates residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility reclamation and closure. Potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt and fine sediments that remain after potash is removed from ore during processing, are stored in surface disposal sites. Some of these tailing materials may also include other contaminants, such as lead, that were introduced as reagents during historic processing methods that may require additional management and could cause additional disposal and reclamation requirements to be imposed. For example, at least one of our New Mexico mining facilities may have legacy issues regarding lead in the tailings pile resulting from production methods utilized prior to our acquisition of these assets. During the life of the tailings management areas, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs to manage potash residual materials in accordance with environmental laws and regulations and with permit requirements. Additional legal and permit requirements will take effect when these facilities are closed.
Our surface permits require us to reclaim property disturbed by operations at our facilities. Our operations in Utah and New Mexico have specific obligations related to reclamation of the land after mining and processing operations are concluded. The discounted present value of our estimated reclamation costs for our mines as of December 31, 2016, is approximately $20.0 million, which is reflected in our financial statements. Various permits and authorization documents negotiated with or issued by the appropriate governmental authorities include these estimated reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis. The undiscounted amount of our estimated reclamation costs for our mines as of December 31, 2016, is approximately $59.3 million. 
It is difficult to estimate and predict the potential actual costs and liabilities associated with remediation and reclamation, and there is no guarantee that we will not be identified in the future as potentially responsible for additional remediation and reclamation costs, either as a result of changes in existing laws and regulations or as a result of the identification of additional matters subject to remediation and/or reclamation obligations or liabilities.
Royalties
The potash, langbeinite, and by-products we produce and sell from mineral leases are subject to royalty payments. We produce and sell from leased land owned by the U.S. government, the States of New Mexico and Utah, and private landowners. The terms of the royalty payments are determined at the time of the issuance or renewal of the leases. Some royalties are determined as a fixed percentage of revenue and others are on a sliding scale that varies with the ore grade. Additionally, some of our leases are subject to overriding royalty interest payments paid to various owners. In 2016, we paid $7.3 million, or an average of 4.2% of sales less freight, in royalties and other taxes. The royalty rates on our state and federal leases in New Mexico are currently set at various rates from 2.0% to 5.0%. The royalty rates for the private leaseholds are between 5.0% and 8.0%. The royalty rates on our state and federal leases in Utah are currently set at rates from 3% to 5%.
Employees
As of January 31, 2017, we had 494 employees, the majority of which were full-time employees. 
We have a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization representing our hourly employees in Wendover, Utah, which expires on May 31, 2017. This is the sixth agreement negotiated between us and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union 00867. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Available Information
