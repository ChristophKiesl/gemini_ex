A company loses its “emerging growth company” status on (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”); (iii) the date on which it has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which it is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b– 2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. As an “emerging growth company,” First Foods is exempt from certain obligations of the Exchange Act including those found in Section 14A(a) and (b) related to shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachute compensation and Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to the requirement that management assess the effectiveness of the company’s internal control for financial reporting. Furthermore, Section 103 of the JOBS Act provides that as an “emerging growth company”, First Foods is not required to comply with the requirement to provide an auditor’s attestation of ICFR under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for as long as First Foods qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” However, an “emerging growth company” is not exempt from the requirement to perform management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

First Foods Group, Inc. is also growing its own new concepts, both through proprietary development and through mergers, acquisitions, and licensing arrangements. The Company has assembled a team of distinguished food service professionals with experience and success at the highest levels of the industry.
 
Since our inception, we commenced our business operations, including developing products, preliminary marketing of the completed work, as well as closing the first twenty sales of our projects. 
 
As an emerging company, we continually analyze our business plan and operations in the light of market conditions and developments. We intend to become a self-sustained operational entity. In order to generate revenues, the management will aim to maximize the Company’s business value by creating competitive products and services, addressing market and competition, utilizing specific marketing strategies, and establishing growth strategy for our company.
 
OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
We are primarily a service based company, providing franchise marketing and consulting services to new and emerging food service franchise companies. We will work with both existing restaurant franchise companies and those restaurant companies that are looking to franchise their operations. We will also be targeting potential acquisitions of restaurant companies that are either franchising currently or who wish to launch a franchise operation. 
TARGET MARKET AND OUR NICHE WITHIN
 
Our target market will be existing and emerging restaurant companies, whose goal it is to expand via the franchise model. Based upon the experience of our board, we feel that this focus will serve us well.
COMPETITION, OUR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY AND METHODS OF COMPETITION
 
There are other venture capital companies who target franchise companies, but not very many just concentrate on the restaurant industry, as we will be doing.

To promote and market our services, we may involve the following strategies:
 
  
· | Establishing an online presence by designing a corporate website reflecting our scope of services offered. We will also engage in a search engine optimization campaign to improve visibility of our website and assist us with awareness for our products and services. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content and HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Approaching our industry target market by email. The most basic method of contacting is a carefully thought out query letter, sent via email, which consists of a one-paragraph synopsis of a project, a bio, a logline, in standard business format. Focusing specifically on our selected target market community who have needs and interests that our Company can address. 
· | Engaging a PR campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business. 
· | Participating in industry conferences and trade shows. 

  
Currently, the Company’s officers and directors promote our services through many channels, including networking at local industry events and Internet sources. We anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the food service industry and by using technical and marketing consultants, which will allow qualified individuals to join our management team and Board of Directors.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company has not expended funds for research and development costs since inception. First Foods has not undertaken any research and development activities regarding our target market and marketability of our products. 
EMPLOYEES
 
The Company’s current employees consist of Abraham Rosenblum as the Secretary and Mark J. Keeley as the Chief Financial Officer, as well as Harold Kestenbaum as a consultant serving in the role of interim Chief Executive Officer. These individuals, along with director Hershel Weiss, are responsible for operations, product development, sales and marketing, fund raising, implementation of our general strategy and execution of our business plan.
 
Our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of the aforementioned individuals. These individuals would be difficult or impossible to replace. The loss of these key contributors, or their failure to perform, could materially and adversely affect our Company's operations. While we may obtain Key Man insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the loss incurred in the event these individuals are lost.
 
Currently, our officers receive deferred compensation for their services and our directors receive no compensation for their services during the development stage of our business operations. Our officers and directors are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf. We anticipate adding two (2) employees over the next twelve (12) months, one of which will be a Chief Marketing Officer. We do not currently have any benefits, such as health or life insurance, available to our employees.
