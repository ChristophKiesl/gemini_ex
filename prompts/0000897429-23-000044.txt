ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Chico’s FAS, Inc.1 is a Florida-based fashion company founded in 1983 on Sanibel Island, Florida. The Company reinvented the fashion retail experience by creating fashion communities anchored by service, which put the customer at the center of everything we do. As one of the leading fashion retailers in North America, Chico’s FAS is a company of three unique brands operating under the Chico's®, White House Black Market® (“WHBM”) and Soma® brand names - each thriving in their own white space, founded by women, led by women, providing solutions that millions of women say give them confidence and joy. We sometimes refer to our Chico's and WHBM brands collectively as our “Apparel Group.” Our distinct lifestyle brands target the needs of fashion-savvy women with moderate-to-high household income levels. We earn revenue and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic retail stores, our various Company-operated e-commerce websites, our call center (which takes orders for all of our brands), through unaffiliated franchise partners and through third-party channels. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 1,269 stores across 46 states, Puerto Rico and the United States (“U.S.”) Virgin Islands, and sold merchandise through 58 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. 
We utilize an integrated, omnichannel approach to managing our business. We want our customers to experience our brands holistically and to view the various retail channels we operate as a single, integrated experience rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. This approach allows our customers to browse, purchase, return or exchange our merchandise through whatever sales channel and at whatever time is most convenient. As a result, we track total sales and comparable sales on a combined basis.
We offer high quality and unique merchandise, supported by outstanding personalized customer service. While each of our brands has a distinct customer base, the overall portfolio caters to a broad age and economic demographic, with moderate-to-high household income levels.
Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the fiscal years ended January 28, 2023 (“fiscal 2022”, “2022” or “current period”), January 29, 2022 (“fiscal 2021”, “2021” or “prior period”), January 30, 2021 (“fiscal 2020” or “2020”), and February 1, 2020 (“fiscal 2019” or “2019”). Each of these periods had 52 weeks.

As used in this report, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” and “Chico's FAS” refer to Chico’s FAS, Inc., a Florida corporation, and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Our Brands
The Company's brands, described in more detail below, are organized into three operating segments and aggregated into one reportable segment due to the similarities of the economic and operating characteristics of the brands.
Chico’s
Our Chico’s brand began operations in 1983 and primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women with moderate-to-high household income levels. The style sensibility is chic and artful, and the brand is known for color and unique completer pieces, from signature jackets to jewelry and accessories that finish the look. Chico's apparel, including the Black LabelTM, Zenergy® and TravelersTM collections, emphasizes an effortless, chic style, comfort and relaxed fit. Accessories and jewelry are original and designed to elevate the clothing assortment, allowing our customer to individualize her personal style. 
The distinctive nature of Chico’s clothing is also reflected in its sizing, which is comprised of sizes 000, 00 (size 0-2), 0 (size 4-6), 1 (size 8-10), 2 (size 12-14), 3 (size 16-18) and 4 (size 20-22). Chico’s will occasionally offer half-sizes (up to 3.5), one-size-fits-all, petite sizes, short and tall inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The relaxed fit allows us to utilize this kind of sizing and thus offer a wide selection of clothing without investing in a large number of sizes within a single style.
Chico's is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, print, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers. 
White House Black Market
The WHBM brand began operations in 1985 and was acquired by the Company in September 2003. WHBM is dedicated to being a go-to style destination and authority on wardrobe building. WHBM primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women with moderate-to-high household income levels. WHBM offers a modern collection to support her every lifestyle moment, selling stylish and versatile clothing and accessory items, including everyday basics and premium denim, polished casual apparel, tailored relaxed workwear, black and white pieces, and feminine all-occasion dresses. The accessories at WHBM, such as shoes, belts, scarves, handbags and jewelry, are specifically designed to coordinate with each collection, allowing customers to easily individualize their wardrobe selections.
WHBM uses American sizes in the 00-14 range (with online sizes up to 16), including petite sizing, as well as short and long inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The fit of the WHBM clothing is tailored to complement the figure of a body-conscious woman, while still remaining comfortable.
WHBM is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of patterns, prints, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers.
Soma
The Soma brand, which began operations in 2004, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie, sleepwear and loungewear products focusing on women who want solutions that are as comfortable as they are beautiful. The Soma brand's core franchises emphasize innovative styles that focus on fit and uncompromising comfort, including BodifyTM, Enbliss® and Vanishing Back® bras, Vanishing Edge® panties and Cool Nights® sleepwear. 
Bras range in size from 32A-46H. The sleepwear and loungewear offerings range in size from extra small to extra-extra-large. 
The Soma team develops product offerings by working closely with a small number of independent suppliers to design proprietary products in-house and, in some cases, designs provided by its independent suppliers under labels other than the Soma brand.
Our Business Strategy
Our overall business strategy is focused on building a collection of distinct high-performing retail brands primarily serving the fashion needs of women with moderate-to-high household income levels.
The primary function of the Company is the production and procurement of beautiful merchandise that delivers the brand promise and brand positioning of each of our brands and resonates with customers. To that end, we are continually strengthening our merchandise and design capabilities and enhancing our sourcing and supply chain to deliver product in a timely manner to our customers while also focusing on improvements to the quality and aesthetic of our merchandise. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of our shareholders.
We pursue improving the performance of our brands by building our omnichannel capabilities, growing our online presence, managing our store base, executing marketing plans, effectively leveraging expenses, considering additional sales channels and markets, and optimizing the merchandise offerings of each of our brands. We continue to invest heavily in our omnichannel capabilities so our customers can fully experience our brands in the manner they choose.
We view our stores and Company-operated e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate, independently operated sales channels. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our primary operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center ("DC") in Winder, Georgia. Our domestic customers can return merchandise to a store or to our DC, regardless of the original purchase location. Using our enhanced “Locate” tool, we ship in-store orders from other locations directly to the customer, expediting delivery times while reducing our shipping costs. In addition, our shared inventory system, enables customers to make purchases online and ship from store. Our mobile apps launched in 2022, as well as our previously introduced customized, branded digital styling software tools, StyleConnect® and MY CLOSETSM and our Buy On-Line, Pick-up In-Store (BOPIS) are driving customer engagement, loyalty and cross-channel shopping. 
We seek to acquire new customers and retain existing customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including digital marketing, social media, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with innovative product offerings, potential new merchandise opportunities, and brand extensions that enhance the current offerings, as well as through our continued emphasis on our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We also will continue to consider potential alternative sales channels for our brands, including international franchise, wholesale, licensing and other opportunities.
We are focused on driving profitable growth through four strategic pillars of being customer led, product obsessed, digital first, and operationally excellent.
•By being customer-led, we are focused on building community engagement, creating exceptional customer experiences, and increasing customer lifetime value.
•We are product obsessed, delivering best-in-class merchandise to our Chico’s, WHBM, and Soma customers, offering beautiful solutions that inspire confidence and joy. At each brand, we are focused on elevating Average Unit Retail and driving full-priced sales growth. 
•Digital-first means we want to strengthen our core platform and data-driven insights and decision-making. We are leveraging technology to engage and deliver to our customers across channels and brands.
•And, to be operationally excellent, we are continually focused on diligently managing our inventory, cost of sales, supply chain, expenses, and real estate; generating healthy cash flow; and delivering a strong bottom line.
Our Customer Service Model
We strive to deliver outstanding and personalized service to our customers through our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We believe this service model is one of our competitive advantages and a key to our continued success. An important aspect to the successful implementation of this model includes specialized training provided to our Stylists and bra experts to help them better meet their customers’ fashion and wardrobe needs. Such needs may include help selecting clothing, intimate apparel or accessories, color and style choices, coordination of complete outfits, or suggestions as to how new pieces can add versatility to our customer’s closets. Our Stylists are encouraged to develop long-term relationships with their customers, to know their customers’ preferences and to assist our customers in selecting merchandise best suited to their tastes and wardrobe needs. Our Stylists utilize tools including our personal closet feature, MY CLOSETTM, and StyleConnect® to access customer purchase history and style preferences, offer personalized recommendations for new products, and connect with her via email, text or chat. These tools allow our Stylists to meet our customer's needs whenever and wherever she wants to shop. 
We also serve our customers’ needs and build customer loyalty through our customer rewards programs. Our programs are designed to reward our loyal customers by leveraging the rich data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience with our brands. The benefits provided are routinely evaluated in conjunction with our overall customer relationship management and marketing activities to ensure they remain a compelling reason for customers to shop at our brands. 
Our customer rewards programs in each of our three brands were relaunched in 2022. The enhanced programs utilize a tier model to incrementally reward customers that spend more and are focused on building customer relationships and increasing frequency. 
We believe our customers are some of the most loyal and long-tenured in retail staying with us a meaningful twelve years at Chico’s, nine years at WHBM and five years at Soma.
Our Boutiques and Outlet Stores
Our boutiques are located in upscale indoor shopping malls, outdoor shopping areas and standalone street-front locations in the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Boutique locations are determined based on various factors, including, but not limited to: market and demographic characteristics, nearby competitors, our own network of existing boutiques, the location of the shopping venue, including the site within the shopping center, proposed lease terms, anchor or other co-tenants, parking accommodations and convenience. Our merchandise is also sold through international franchise locations in Mexico, including boutique locations as well as shop-in-shop formats within a department store environment. 
Our outlet stores are primarily located in quality outlet centers. The Chico’s and WHBM brand outlets contain a mixture of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our boutique stores. Soma outlets contain a mix of boutique and clearance merchandise. We also sell clearance merchandise on our brand websites and at www.chicosofftherack.com. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise sold at our outlets and adjust that ratio as appropriate.
As of January 28, 2023, we operated 1,269 retail stores in 46 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and sold merchandise through 58 international franchise locations in Mexico and 2 domestic airport locations. The following tables set forth information concerning our retail stores during the past four fiscal years:

Enhancing the Productivity of our Real Estate Portfolio
Stores continue to be an important part of our omnichannel strategy, and digital sales are higher in markets where we have a retail presence. We opened 27 new Soma stores and closed 24 underperforming locations in fiscal 2022 . The Company ended the fiscal year with 1,269 boutiques. We will continue to adjust our store base to align with our strategy. We plan to open up to 15 new Soma stores and refresh approximately 60 stores in fiscal 2023. Store closures primarily occur as leases come due, lease kickouts are available, or buyouts make economic sense. The Company anticipates closing approximately 20 stores in fiscal 2023. We will continue to evaluate our store base in light of economic conditions and our business strategy and may adjust the openings and closures as conditions require or as opportunities arise. 
Exit of Canada Frontline Operations
On July 30, 2020, Chico’s FAS Canada, Co., an immaterial subsidiary of the Company, filed for bankruptcy with the Ontario, Canada office of the Superintendent in Bankruptcy. This action resulted in the permanent closure of four Chico’s and six WHBM boutiques in Ontario, Canada. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we exited our Canada frontline operations and recorded on a net basis a non-material charge, including the realization of a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment.
Information Technology/Data Analytics
We are committed to making ongoing investments in information technology systems to support our strategies within customer, digital, omnichannel and supply chain. Our information systems are designed to enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We periodically test new technologies and platforms to support and enhance our processes across all areas of our business. We are migrating to an industry-leading customer database and customer marketing platform to personalize the customer journey and manage all customer communication in an effort to increase traffic and conversion across all channels.
Digital Commerce
Each of our brands has a digital presence: www.chicos.com, www.chicosofftherack.com, www.whbm.com and www.soma.com. These sites provide customers the ability to shop our stores 24/7, digitally browse our inventory prior to making a trip to our stores or locate a store near them. Customers can choose to buy online, pick-up in store (BOPIS), pick up curbside or have merchandise shipped directly to them. Customers can also choose to engage with online content to learn more about the stories of how our products were made or read customer reviews on the site to help influence their purchase. We also offer various payment methods including buy now, pay later.
Our websites play a vital role in both our omnichannel strategy and the overall shopping experience of how we continuously put our customer in the center of everything we do. Many products are exclusively available online including extended sizes, additional style and color choices and clearance items. Online merchandise is also available for order through our call center and through clienteling applications in our stores. We also utilize ecommerce solutions and are constantly exploring new digital opportunities to expand our customer base and drive sales. 
We remain focused on our omnichannel approach through continuous optimization to all brand websites including new features, functionality, search engine optimization and content designed to improve and evolve the customer's experience.
Marketing and Advertising 
Our brands use industry-leading transactional data to develop targeted and effective marketing strategies. To optimize our marketing efforts and to attract new customers, we continue to shift our advertising from traditional media, instead placing more emphasis on digital media. We also use predictive modeling and advanced segmentation methodologies to drive customer retention and reactivation. 
We use the following marketing and media-mix programs to engage current customers and attract prospective customers:
•Digital marketing: mobile paid search, product listing ads, display banner advertising and remarketing, affiliate programs;
•Social marketing: organic and paid efforts across social platforms;
•Customer Rewards programs;
•Editorial content;
•Public relations; and
•Charitable giving and outreach programs.
In 2023, our marketing efforts will focus on retaining existing, reactivating lapsed and attracting new customers to our iconic brands' differentiated positioning by leveraging advanced analytics and tools that support audience segmentation and personalization.
Product Sourcing
Our product sourcing activities are performed by a centralized shared service team that is focused on maintaining our quality standards and identifying cost-effective opportunities to improve production speed and flexibility. In fiscal 2022, Vietnam sources accounted for approximately 36% of our merchandise cost. We take ownership of merchandise either in the foreign country, at a designated point of entry into the U.S., or at our DC, depending on the specific terms of sale. 
The majority of our merchandise is purchased through suppliers with whom we have established strategic collaborations; these key suppliers represented 81% of our purchases in fiscal 2022 with our largest supplier accounting for 14% of the total. 
 Since fiscal 2017, substantial work has been done to reduce the supply chain base and agents, with the supplier base count down 34% as of the end of fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, our focus will be on adding new factories and suppliers to our core suppliers to enhance our overall diversification and resiliency in the face of further pandemic-related disruptions. We intend to leverage new factories with existing vendors to safeguard our future purchases and maintain scale. In some instances, we may seek new strategic partners when we deem there is too much risk in an existing relationship. We intend to maintain a vast majority of volume with our key suppliers. We plan to continue to supplement the remaining volume with a subset of market suppliers to meet any of the unique needs of the Company’s brands.
Even though we do not own the facilities that manufacture our products, to elevate their focus on important areas pertaining to social, health and safety, security and sustainable environmental practices, we require that our manufacturers adhere to our Global Vendor Code of Conduct and other standards. We believe in a “Continuous Improvement” methodology and work in partnership with our suppliers to help maintain compliance with our standards. However, certain zero tolerance violations constitute grounds for locating alternative suppliers or manufacturing resources. For more information on our Global Supply Chain governance practices, see our annual Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Impact Report, which is publicly available on www.chicosfas.com.
Merchandise Distribution
The distribution function for our brands is primarily handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia. New merchandise is generally received daily at the DC. Imported merchandise is shipped from the country-of-export either by sea, air, truck or rail, as circumstances require. Domestic merchandise is primarily shipped by truck or rail. Upon arrival at our DC, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment and direct shipment to customers. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 
Our DC has been granted Foreign Trade Zone status from both the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This status facilitates international expansion and allows us to move certain merchandise into the DC without paying U.S. Customs duty until the merchandise is subsequently shipped to domestic stores or online customers.
Competition
The women’s retail apparel and intimate apparel business is highly competitive and includes local, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies and online retailers. We compete with such retailers in-store and online, both domestically and internationally, and on the basis of a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, quality, style, fashion, prices and selection. We believe that our distinctively designed merchandise offerings and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from our competitors.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as “Marks”).
Our Marks include, but are not limited to: BODIFY, CHICO’S, CHICO'S OFF THE RACK, CHICO'S REWARDS+, COOL NIGHTS, EMBRACEABLE, ENBLISS, FLEXICUP, FLOATAWAY WIRE, NO IRON, SMART BRA, SOMA, SOMA INTIMATES, SOMA REWARDS+, SO SLIMMING, STYLECONNECT, TRAVELERS, VANISHING, VANISHING BACK, VANISHING EDGE, WHBM, WHBM FORME, WHBM REWARDS+, WHITE HOUSE BLACK MARKET and ZENERGY. We have registered or are seeking to register a number of these Marks in the U.S, Canada, Mexico and other foreign countries.
In the opinion of management, our rights in the Marks are important to our business. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the U.S.
Government Regulation
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and various other federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. 
Additionally, we are subject to various laws and regulations regarding our products, including the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions.
We are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. In recent years, these controls, tariffs, regulations and restrictions have had, and we believe may continue to have, a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products, and to manufacture or source inventory.
Federal tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change could materially impact our federal taxes and reduce profitability. We continually monitor federal tax legislative and regulatory developments to understand their potential impact on our profitability.
Other than as noted above, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures (including expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings, or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our Company and that could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Management
As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 14,238 people, 32% of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. As of the above date, approximately 89% of our employees worked in our boutique and outlet stores.
The Company strives to create a culture that attracts and retains qualified talent, with diverse backgrounds, experience and skills embodying our cultural values, to drive our strategic priorities forward and support the Company’s overall goals and objectives. Our Human Resources, Compensation and Benefits Committee (“HRCBC”) meets regularly to provide formal oversight and guidance related to the Company’s human capital management, including our culture, human resources programs and policies, and compensation and benefits philosophy as outlined in its charter. The HRCBC receives updates on talent, succession planning, diversity and inclusion and other strategies related to our human capital management and provides periodic updates to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).
We believe the enthusiasm of our approximately 14,238 associates is one of the significant contributors to our success as a family of brands. Each and every day, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our associates and customers. 
Commitment to our Cultural Values
Our five core values shape our culture and define our character. We view them as the lenses that help inform our decisions and actions for our customers, our associates, and our Company.
•Passion for Fashion – Inhale fashion, exhale style. It’s what we love.
•Continuously Improve, Follow Your Curiosity – Ask questions. Share something. Learn something.
•Customer Centricity – Our customer is at the center of everything we do, both internally and externally.
•Be Inspired and Inspire Others – Seek out diverse ideas and thoughts. Embrace new ways of thinking.
•Be Accountable – We are accountable to metrics. We are recognized for results.
Diversity and Inclusion 
We value the diverse experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds of our associates and customers. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment that celebrates individuality, influences our culture, and helps to innovate the way we work. Our Board, largely through its Environmental, Social and Governance Committee and HRCBC, oversees our diversity and inclusion efforts, including aligning on corporate goals and receiving regular updates from internal stakeholders. The Company continues to focus on building a culture that supports fair compensation and advancement opportunities for all associates regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.
We have three main focus areas within diversity and inclusion: Attraction and Retention, Education and Training, and Customer Focus:
a.Attraction and Retention – We believe that it is currently appropriate to focus our attraction strategy on enhancing the skills and attention of our recruitment team members, improving and leveraging digital tools to reach a more diverse audience and expanding the reach of our partnerships. We believe that, to increase retention, associates must have a sense of belonging, not only on their individual teams but within the Company. We focus on campus events and celebrations, networking opportunities, recognition, and associate network groups to enhance our culture and provide a sense of belonging for associates. 
b.Education and Training – We conduct trainings for our full-time associates and certain other associates on unconscious bias, the impact of inclusion, cultural awareness, and racial equity. Associates are able to access and complete other inclusion and diversity trainings through FASU, which is an online platform that provides access to programs and tutorials. 
c.Customer Focus – We strive to be inclusive in our designs, marketing and customer service. 
Talent Acquisition
Our campus in Fort Myers, Florida is headquarters to our corporate operations, and where we primarily focus on supporting our 1,269 retail locations. 
With stores throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and franchise locations in Mexico, as well as an online presence for each of our brands, it takes sophisticated technology, resources and infrastructure to ensure our continued success. From finance and accounting to technology, human resources, and merchandising careers, we offer diverse opportunities for talented professionals. We remain committed to and focused on attracting talent that is product and customer obsessed like us. We are an equal opportunity employer, and we seek to be inclusive in our recruitment efforts.
Learning and Development
We believe that ongoing learning is an important component of our associates’ success. We provide associates access to FASU, which is an online platform and provides access to programs and tutorials that can be voluntarily completed or assigned based on one’s role. These include instructor-led classes, in both virtual and classroom settings, and self-led content such as articles, eLearning, and videos, each covering a variety of topics, such as leadership, personal development and compliance best practices, product knowledge and core competencies, among others.
All full-time associates receive annual trainings on important topics, including, but not limited to, data protection and privacy, insider trading, and unconscious bias, to assist our efforts to maintain a safe, positive, and inclusive work environment. 
Total Rewards
We believe it is important to provide competitive compensation, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our associates. We strive to provide market-competitive compensation for our salaried and hourly associates. A portion of our eligible associates participate in our short- and long-term incentive programs, which are designed to reward performance that meets personal and corporate objectives. We offer a full range of competitive benefit options to eligible associates that are intended to serve their overall well-being. In addition to medical and prescription drug coverage, we offer full-time associates dental and long-term disability coverage and health savings and flexible spending accounts. Both our part- and full-time associates have access to our Employee Assistance Program, and we offer eligible associates paid time-off, holiday observances and additional leave for certain life events. We also have on-site health and fitness centers at our Company headquarters and distribution center. Additionally, we offer a 401(k) plan, with associates becoming eligible for our corporate match program after one year of employment.
Communication and Engagement
We value our associates and recognize the importance of their contributions. We believe that a well-informed and engaged community is a key to our success and the achievement of our goals.
Giving Back to our Communities
The Company strives to positively impact our customers, associates and the communities in which we live and do business through community service and giving back. Our Chico’s FAS Cares Volunteer Days and our paid voluntary community service hours policy give our associates the opportunity to give back by donating their time to support local charities. 
Our brand and corporate cause-related initiatives are focused on raising awareness and funds through local, regional, and national partnerships. We support community-based philanthropic causes and disaster relief efforts by encouraging associate 
volunteerism and customer philanthropy, including through our Soma® Bra Donation program and the WHBM® Give Back: Recycle Your Jeans with WHBM® program.

Available on our website (under the tab “ABOUT US” within “Governance Documents & Charters”) (or upon written request by any shareholder), charters of each of the following for our Company can be found: Audit Committee; Human Resources, Compensation and Benefits Committee; Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; ESG Committee; Executive Committee; and Merchant Committee. Also in the same section of our website are the following: Corporate Governance Guidelines; Insider Trading Policy; Complaint Procedures for Accounting Matters (our “whistleblower” policy); Stock Ownership Guidelines; and Policy on Granting Equity Awards.
