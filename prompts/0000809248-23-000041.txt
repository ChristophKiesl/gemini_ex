ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
Our Company 
We are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 60 years. We operate two distinct quick service restaurant brands, Burger King and Popeyes, with 1,087 restaurants located in 23 Northeastern, Midwestern, Southcentral and Southeastern states as of January 1, 2023. 
For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, our restaurants generated total revenues of $1,730.4 million and our average annual restaurant sales for all restaurants was approximately $1.6 million per restaurant. We served an average of approximately 460,000 guests per day at our restaurants. In fiscal 2022, comparable restaurant sales at our Burger King restaurants increased 3.9% and at our Popeyes restaurants increased 4.9%.
Our Burger King Restaurants. We are the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. Burger King restaurants are quick service sandwich restaurants that feature the popular flame-grilled Whopper® sandwich, as well as a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, breakfast items, snacks, soft drinks and more. We believe that the competitive attributes of Burger King restaurants include significant brand recognition, convenience of location, quality, speed of service and value.
As of January 1, 2023, we operated 1,022 Burger King restaurants located in restaurants located in 23 Northeastern, Midwestern, Southcentral and Southeastern states. For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, the average weekly sales at our Burger King restaurants was $30,870 per restaurant.
We operate our Burger King restaurants under franchise agreements with BKC. Our Burger King restaurants are typically open seven days per week and generally have operating hours ranging from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm, with later hours in certain markets or on weekends. 
Our existing Burger King restaurants consist of one of several building types with various seating capacities. Our typical freestanding restaurant is approximately 2,800 to 3,100 square feet with seating capacity for 45 to 65 guests, drive-thru service windows and adjacent parking areas. Almost all of our restaurants are freestanding. 
Our Popeyes Restaurants. We are the eighth largest Popeyes franchisee in the United States based on number of restaurants. Popeyes restaurants are quick service chicken restaurants that feature a Louisiana-inspired home cooking styled menu including fried chicken, chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, fried shrimp and other seafood, red beans and rice and other regional offerings. 
As of January 1, 2023, we operated 65 Popeyes restaurants in seven Southeastern states. For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, the average weekly sales at our Popeyes restaurants was $26,036 per restaurant.
We operate our Popeyes restaurants under franchise agreements with PLK. Our Popeyes restaurants are typically open seven days per week with operating hours of 10:00 am to 10:00 pm with later hours on weekends. Our Popeyes restaurants are generally freestanding locations with approximately 2,000 to 2,300 square feet with seating capacity for 40 to 50 guests and a drive-thru. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Two Distinct Brands with Global Recognition, Innovative Marketing and New Product Development. As a franchisee of the Burger King and Popeyes brands, we benefit from, and rely on, RBI's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and generate increased restaurant traffic. RBI has historically launched innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns and products that highlight the relevance of the Burger King and Popeyes brands. Additionally, in 2020, RBI supported the launch of digital ordering and delivery options for our guests. RBI has negotiated distribution and operational agreements for BKC and PLK with major delivery platform providers, such as DoorDash, UberEats and GrubHub, and introduced its own white label mobile apps for each brand which has allowed us to quickly offer this service option to our guests. In 2021, RBI introduced the Royal Perks loyalty program for Burger King and the Popeyes Rewards loyalty program for Popeyes to entice guests to visit more often as well as receive personalized offers on their respective mobile apps.
As the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States based on number of restaurants, we operate approximately 15% of the Burger King restaurants in the United States and believe that we are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry. We believe that our large number of restaurants increases our ability to take advantage of our size and scale to effectively manage the image and awareness of the Burger King brand in certain markets through promotional advertising, remodeling initiatives and our operational expertise. Further, we also believe that the geographic footprint of our restaurants provides our business with stability while also providing opportunities for growth within existing markets. 
Over the years, BKC has introduced promotional campaigns that leverage both value and premium menu offerings and has provided a platform for new premium sandwich offerings. We believe these campaigns continue to positively impact the brand today as BKC focuses on offering a balanced value menu and premium sandwich promotional mix and remains committed to new product launches. For the Popeyes brand, the successful launch of the Classic Chicken Sandwich has driven product innovation to continue the brand's appeal to a broader consumer base, which we expect will continue to enhance sales and restaurant traffic. 
Operational Expertise. We have been operating Burger King restaurants since 1976 and have developed sophisticated information and operating systems that enable us to measure and monitor key metrics for operational performance, food quality, sales and profitability that may not be available to other restaurant operators. We believe that our focus on leveraging our operational expertise, infrastructure and systems helps us optimize the performance of our current restaurants and restaurants that we may acquire or open in the future. We also believe that our size and history with the Burger King brand and quick service restaurant operations enables us to effectively track operating metrics and leverage best practices across our organization. It is our belief that our experienced 
management team, operating culture, effective operating systems and infrastructure enable us to operate more efficiently than many other Burger King operators. Finally, we believe that we will be able to leverage our operational expertise to improve the performance of our Popeyes restaurants. 
Resilient Business Model and Financial Strength of our Business. We believe that the quality and sophistication of our restaurant operations have helped drive our strong restaurant-level performance. Comparable restaurant sales for our restaurants have historically outperformed the Burger King system in the United States overall, including in 22 of the last 24 fiscal quarters (after adjusting for periods where our fiscal year did not materially align with their calendar). We also believe that our size, seasoned management team, extensive operating infrastructure, experience and proven operating disciplines differentiate us from many competing quick service restaurant operators. After navigating through the challenges brought on with the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages and increased commodity costs, we believe we have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business model and our ability to respond quickly to unprecedented business disruption. It is also our belief that our strong restaurant-level operations coupled with our disciplined approach to financial management will continue to allow us to maintain restaurant profitability under a wide variety of economic environments. 
Over the past three years, we believe we have demonstrated our commitment to maintaining ample liquidity, managing leverage, generating free cash flow, and applying a disciplined approach to capital expenditures and restaurant development. We renegotiated our area development agreement with BKC and terminated our development agreement with PLK, which we believe facilitates our ability to be more disciplined in our allocation of capital by enhancing our ability to more selectively develop and remodel restaurants offering the most promising expected returns on our investments. 
We believe we have also demonstrated our ability to prudently manage our capital structure and financial leverage, including through a variety of challenging economic circumstances. It is our belief that our cash flow from operations, cash balances and the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below) are sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and capital expenditures.
Strategic Relationship with RBI and BKC. We have been a franchisee of Burger King restaurants for over 45 years and operate approximately 15% of the total Burger King restaurants in the United States.  Since 2012, two of BKC's or RBI's senior executives have served on the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Currently, Matthew Dunnigan, Chief Financial Officer of RBI, the indirect parent company of BKC, and Tom Curtis, President of BKC, Americas, serve on our Board. BKC holds, through certain of its affiliated entities, a preferred stock equity interest in Carrols Restaurant Group that is convertible into approximately 15.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (after giving effect to the conversion of such preferred stock and excluding shares held in treasury). We believe we have a well-established relationship with RBI and BKC and our acquisitions, restaurant remodeling and new restaurant development over the years has further aligned our common interests to grow our business. We believe that the combination of our rights under the Amended and Restated Area Development Agreement dated as of January 4, 2021 among the Company, Carrols Corporation, Carrols LLC and BKC (the "Amended ADA") and RBI's equity interest in our Company and its representation on our Board of Directors will continue to reinforce the alignment of our common interests with RBI, BKC and PLK over the long term. 
Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record. We believe that our senior management team's extensive experience in the restaurant industry and its long and successful history of developing, acquiring, integrating and operating quick-service restaurants provide us with a competitive advantage. 
Our restaurant operations are overseen by our Chief Restaurant Officer, Joseph Hoffman, who has worked in Burger King restaurants for over 30 years. As of January 1, 2023, operations for our Burger King restaurants are overseen by our four Senior Division Directors and nine Region Directors who collectively had an average of 18 years of Burger King restaurant experience. We also have 148 district managers who support the Regional Directors in the management of our Burger King restaurants and had an average tenure of over 11 years in the Burger King system as of January 1, 2023. Our operations management is further supported by our infrastructure of financial, information systems, real estate, human resources and legal professionals. 
Our Business Strategies 
Our primary business strategies are as follows: 
Increase Restaurant Sales and Improve Guest Traffic. RBI has identified and implemented a number of strategies to increase brand awareness, enhance the guest experience, improve overall operations, invest in digital and technology and drive sales. These strategies are central to our strategic objectives to deliver profitable growth. 
•"Reclaim the Flame." BKC announced its "Reclaim the Flame" plan in September 2022 which includes an investment by BKC of $400 million over two years to accelerate sales growth and drive franchisee profitability. The investment includes $150 million in advertising and digital investments ("Fuel the Flame") and $250 million for restaurant technology, kitchen equipment, building enhancements and high-quality remodels and relocations ("Royal Reset"). 
◦"Fuel the Flame." BKC will invest $120 million in its U.S. advertising fund over the two years to grow traffic, accelerate sales growth and improve the guest experience. The BKC advertising investment is expected to be an annual increase of approximately 30% to the brand's media purchasing. Following BKC's increased investment in 2023 and 2024, participating franchisees, including Carrols, have agreed to increase their advertising fund contributions by 50 basis points through 2028 if certain profitability thresholds are met, which would continue the increased level of advertising spend for the brand. BKC will also invest $30 million through 2024 to improve the Burger King app guest experience, including through integrated payment processing, enhancing the Royal Perks loyalty program, digital personalized offers, and improving the overall convenience of delivery and pick up options. We believe these investments and this elevated advertising spend will benefit our sales and guest traffic in our restaurants.
◦"Royal Reset." This $250 million investment by our franchisor will work in combination with the ongoing restaurant maintenance spending and remodeling activity of its franchisees to increase the restaurant technology deployment to the Burger King system and accelerate the modernization of the Burger King restaurant portfolio. We expect to take full advantage of the restaurant refresh program, which represents $50 million for the whole brand and which will allow us to deploy restaurant equipment and technology upgrades in an accelerated fashion. This investment also includes $200 million in system-wide subsidies and cash advances for restaurant remodel projects over the next two years. This funding will allow us to complete more remodel projects within our existing capital allocation strategy than we otherwise could have. 
•Advertising and Promotion. We believe that we will benefit from BKC's advertising support of its menu items, product innovation and re-imaging initiatives. In 2022, BKC announced their new brand positioning strategy, called "You Rule.", intended to establish an emotional connection with consumers and drive everyday relevance of the Burger King brand in consumers' lives. You Rule is intended to be the new way to say "Have it Your Way," where our consumers are the real royalty. BKC continues to prioritize a data driven marketing process which has focused on driving restaurant sales and traffic while targeting a broad consumer base with inclusive messaging. This strategy uses a multi-channel advertising plan inclusive of traditional media, such as broadcast television, and digital, such as social media. 
•Operations. We believe that improving restaurant operations and enhancing the guest experience are key components to increasing the profitability of our restaurants. We have operational action plans in place to continue to improve guest satisfaction scores and increase hours of operations, both of which we believe will increase restaurant sales. We are also actively involved in and believe we will benefit from RBI's 
ongoing initiatives to improve guest experience, increase food quality, simplify restaurant-level execution, improve team member training and engagement, and monitor operational performance. 
•Products. The strength of the BKC menu has been built on a distinct flame-grilled cooking platform to make better tasting hamburgers. We believe that BKC intends to continue to optimize the menu by focusing on core products, such as the flagship Whopper sandwich, while maintaining a balance between value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive sales and traffic. With respect to PLK, the launch of the Classic Chicken Sandwich has driven product innovation to continue the brand's appeal to a broader consumer base, which we expect will continue to enhance sales and restaurant traffic.
•Image. We believe that re-imaged restaurants increase curb appeal and result in increased restaurant sales. BKC's current restaurant image features a fresh, sleek, eye-catching design which incorporates easy-to-navigate digital menu boards in the dining room and streamlined merchandising at the drive-thru. The restaurants also offer guests the opportunity to connect to free Wi-Fi within the dining room. We believe that restaurant remodeling has improved our guest experience and contributed to incremental sales. We also believe the guest experience will be further enhanced from upgrades to BKC's current restaurant image which include a double drive-thru (where applicable), modifications to the exterior image and the deployment of restaurant technology in connection with Burger Kings "Royal Reset". 
•Digital. In 2020, RBI implemented digital order modes and delivery services with major delivery providers as well as through each brands' own mobile apps. At the end of 2022, 1,017 of our Burger King restaurants and 65 of our Popeyes restaurants were providing fully integrated delivery services, based on geographic availability of delivery services. In 2021, RBI introduced the Royal Perks loyalty program for Burger King and the Popeyes Rewards loyalty program for Popeyes, both designed to entice guests to visit more often as well as to provide personalized offers on the brands' respective mobile apps. We believe these new platforms support RBI's strategy to appeal to a broader consumer base and to increase restaurant sales and expect that their "Fuel the Flame" investment will drive further penetration to the digital market. 
Improve Profitability of Restaurants. In 2021 and 2022, overall U.S. inflation rates have escalated to levels the U.S economy had not experienced recently. For our business specifically, we have been heavily impacted by commodity and labor inflation beginning in second quarter 2021 and extending into most of 2022. Commodity inflation for our Burger King restaurants was 8.3% and 15.3% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and for our Popeyes restaurants was 4.7% and 17.6% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Average hourly rate inflation at all of our restaurants was 12.0% and 9.1% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
•Pricing. In response to elevated input costs, we have further developed our pricing practices and strategy, resulting in effective selling price increases at our Burger King restaurants of 4.1% for all of 2021 and 9.4% for all of 2022. The effective selling price is impacted for twelve months after the pricing action is instituted.
•Promotions. We have also worked closely with BKC on multi-faceted restaurant profitability initiatives, including their promotional pricing practices. Promotional sales discounts at all of our restaurants in 2022 were 15.8% of restaurant sales compared to 19.8% in 2021. BKC has identified improving restaurant-level profitability as a focus closely tied to their "Reclaim the Flame" investments. We believe this alignment in interests with our franchisor will further augment our actions to increase restaurant margins after this period of input cost inflation. 
•Operations. We believe that improving restaurant operations and enhancing the guest experience are key components to increasing the profitability of our restaurants. We have operational action plans in place to continue to improve our guest satisfaction scores and increase hours of operations, both of which we believe will help increase restaurant sales. Further, we have ongoing initiatives to enhance labor efficiency which we believe will drive continued profitability improvements. 
We believe that our skilled management team, proven technology systems, and training and development programs support our ability to enhance operating margins at our restaurants and position us well to respond to the changing economic environment we are in. We believe that we have demonstrated our ability to operate profitable and operationally efficient restaurants and we believe that our expertise and scale positions us favorably to combat ongoing macro-economic challenges.
Balanced Approach to Capital Allocation and Generation of Free Cash Flow. We believe our balance sheet provides us with significant liquidity, a long runway in terms of debt maturities and stable and manageable debt service obligations. Over the past three years, we have significantly increased our available liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus available borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities) to approximately $211.3 million as of January 1, 2023 from $60.6 million as of December 29, 2019. We believe we have the flexibility to grow our business - both organically and through selective new restaurant development and remodeling initiatives – in a manner that will optimize our growth potential while generating consistent free cash flow and managing our leverage levels.
We have reduced capital expenditures from $134.9 million in 2019 and $75.7 million in 2018 to $56.9 million in 2020, $51.8 million in 2021 and $38.2 million in 2022. In 2023 and for the foreseeable future, we expect our capital expenditure spending to be at levels similar to 2022 as we remain committed to applying a disciplined and focused approach to restaurant remodeling and new restaurant development. We believe our restaurant portfolio has been well-maintained and, as of January 1, 2023, 890 of our 1,022 Burger King restaurants have been remodeled or newly built since 2012. Of our 65 Popeyes restaurants, 20 have been newly built in the last five years as of January 1, 2023.
Target Total Net Leverage Ratio of 4.0 times or less.  Our capital allocation strategy is driven by targeting a Total Net Leverage Ratio of 4.0 times or less. While driving growth through building and remodeling restaurants in both brands remains a strategic objective of ours over the long-term, our primary focus is on generating free cash flow and further deleveraging our balance sheet to maintain our Total Net Leverage Ratio at or below our target level of 4.0 times. Achieving our Total Net Leverage Ratio level is subject to a number of factors which may be difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any specific Total Net Leverage Ratio. 
Inflationary pressures experienced in 2021 and 2022 have increased our Total Net Leverage Ratio above our target to 5.02 times at January 2, 2022 and 7.14 times at January 1, 2023 as increased labor and commodity costs negatively impacted our covenant EBITDA. Over time, we believe we will reduce our Net Leverage Ratio to our targeted levels through organic growth as inflationary pressures subside and our margins improve although there is no assurance we will do so.

(1)Average annual sales per restaurant are derived by dividing restaurant sales by the average number of restaurants operating during the period on a 52-week basis for the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 or 53-week basis for the year ended January 3, 2021.
Restaurant Capital Costs 
The initial cost of the franchise fee, equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs of a standard new Burger King and Popeyes restaurant currently is approximately $600,000 (which excludes the cost of land, the building and site improvements). In the markets in which we operate, the cost of land generally ranges from 
$300,000 to $1,000,000 for Burger King restaurants and $300,000 to $1,000,000 for Popeyes restaurants and the cost of building and site improvements generally ranges from $1,000,000 to $1,800,000 for both Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. 
With respect to the development of freestanding restaurants, if we acquire land and construct the building, we typically seek to thereafter enter into an arrangement to sell and leaseback the land and building under a long-term lease. Historically, we have been able to acquire and finance many of our locations under such leasing arrangements. Where we are unable to purchase the underlying land, we enter into a long-term lease for the land followed by construction of the building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. 
The cost of securing real estate and developing and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including local economic conditions and the characteristics of a particular site. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from the historical cost of restaurants previously opened and the estimated costs above. 
BKC's current image restaurant design draws inspiration from its signature flame-grilled cooking process and incorporates a variety of innovative elements to a backdrop that evokes the warm and welcoming look of the outdoors including corrugated metal, brick, wood and concrete. The cost of remodeling a restaurant to the BKC current image varies depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed and can range from $700,000 to $1,800,000 per restaurant with an average cost of approximately $1.2 million per restaurant in 2022. The total cost of a remodel has increased over time due to construction cost increases, the addition of a second drive-thru lane at certain locations and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment at the time of the remodel which is incremental to the cost to upgrade to the BKC current image design. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations".
Under BKC's "Royal Reset" program, BKC will make certain contributions towards franchisee remodel costs, which increase in value if BKC owns the property and/or if the franchisee agrees to pay a 1% higher royalty rate over the 20-year franchise term renewal. At this time, we do not expect participation in the "Royal Reset" program to materially impact our levels of capital expenditures. It may, however, allow us to complete more projects with the same level of capital expenditure.
Site Selection
We believe that the location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant's success. We evaluate potential new sites on many critical criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management approves the viability of all new sites, remodel and acquisition prospects based upon analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals and our return on investment requirements.
Seasonality 
Our business is moderately seasonal due to a number of factors such as regional weather conditions and the timing of holidays. Due to the location of our restaurants, sales are generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.

Operations
Management Structure 
We conduct substantially all of our executive management, finance, marketing and operations support functions from our corporate headquarters in Syracuse, New York. Carrols Restaurant Group is led by our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Hull who is continuing to serve as our Chief Financial Officer while serving as Interim President and CEO. Mr. Hull, who has helped lead the Company through a variety of challenging circumstances over the past three years, has over 35 years of operations and finance experience in both public and private companies with domestic and international operations in a broad range of industries.
Our restaurant operations are overseen by our Chief Restaurant Officer, Joseph Hoffman, who has worked in Burger King restaurants for over 30 years. As of January 1, 2023, operations for our Burger King restaurants are overseen by our four Senior Division Directors and nine Regional Directors who collectively had an average of 18 years of Burger King restaurant experience. We also have 148 district managers who support the Regional Directors in the management of our Burger King restaurants and had an average tenure of over 11 years in the Burger King system as of January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2023, operations for our Popeyes restaurants are overseen by one Senior Division Director, two Regional Directors and eleven district managers. 
A district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately seven to eight restaurants. Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants. Regional directors, district managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision, and for our regional directors and district managers, the combined performance of all of our restaurants. Most often, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried general manager and one to three assistant managers. 
Management Information Systems 
We believe that our management information systems provide us with the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure the consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. Our size affords us the ability to maintain an in-house staff of information technology and restaurant systems professionals dedicated to continuously enhancing our systems. We believe these capabilities allow us to quickly integrate restaurants that we acquire and achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies. 
Our restaurants employ POS systems that are designed to facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking. These systems are user-friendly, require limited employee training and improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques. The POS systems are integrated with applications at the restaurant and hosted systems at our corporate office that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. 
Our restaurant systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs and inventories, and other key operating metrics for each restaurant. We communicate electronically with our restaurants on a continuous basis via a high-speed data network, which enables us to collect this information for use in our corporate management systems in near real-time. Our corporate data center manages systems that support all of our accounting, operating and reporting systems. We also operate a 24-hour, seven-day help desk that enables us to provide systems and operational support to our restaurant operations. Among other things, our restaurant information systems provide us with the ability to: 
•monitor labor utilization and sales trends at each restaurant, enabling the restaurant manager to effectively manage to our established labor standards on a timely basis; 
•reduce inventory shrinkage using restaurant-level inventory management systems and daily reporting of inventory variances; 
•analyze sales and product mix data to help restaurant managers forecast production levels throughout the day; 
•monitor day-part drive-thru speed of service at each of our restaurants; 
•allow the restaurant manager to produce day-part labor schedules based on the restaurant's historical sales patterns;
•systematically communicate human resource and payroll data to our administrative offices for efficient centralized management of labor costs and payroll processing; 
•allow guests to place mobile and third-party delivery orders that integrate directly with the point-of-sale system;
•employ centralized control over pricing, menu and inventory management activities at each restaurant; 
•place orders with suppliers and to integrate detailed invoice, receiving and product data with our inventory and accounting systems; 
•provide analytics and reporting tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data; and
•systematically analyze and report on detailed transactional data to help detect and identify potential theft. 
Critical information from our systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurants. Our district managers also receive near real-time information for their respective restaurants and have access to key operating data on a remote basis using our corporate intranet-based reporting. Management personnel at all levels, from restaurant managers through senior management, utilize and monitor key restaurant performance indicators that are also included in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans.
Burger King and Popeyes Franchise Agreements 
Each of our Burger King restaurants operates under a separate franchise agreement with BKC and each of our Popeyes restaurants operates under a separate franchise agreement with PLK. Our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK generally require, among other things, that all restaurants comply with specified design criteria and operate in a prescribed manner, including utilization of a standard menu. In addition, our Burger King franchise agreements generally require that our restaurants conform to BKC's current image and may provide for updating our restaurants during the tenth year of the agreements to conform to such current image, which may require significant expenditures. 
These franchise agreements with BKC and PLK generally provide for an initial term of 20 years and currently have an initial franchise fee of $50,000. In the event that we terminate a franchise agreement and close the related BKC restaurant prior to the expiration of its term, we generally are required to pay BKC an amount based on the net present value of the royalty stream that would have been realized by BKC had such franchise agreement not been terminated. With BKC's and PLK's respective approval, we can elect to extend franchise agreements for additional 20-year terms, provided that the restaurant meets the current restaurant image standard and we are not in default under terms of the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement fee for subsequent renewals for our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants is currently $50,000. BKC or PLK may terminate any of the franchise agreements if an act of default is committed by us under these agreements and such default is not cured. Defaults under the franchise agreements for our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants include, among other things, our failure to operate such restaurant in accordance with the operating standards and specifications established by BKC or PLK (including failure to use equipment, uniforms or decor approved by the respective franchisor), our failure to sell products approved or designated by BKC or PLK, our failure to pay royalties or advertising and sales promotion contributions as required, our unauthorized sale, transfer or assignment of such franchise agreement or the related restaurant, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, conduct by us or our employees that has a harmful effect on the Burger King or Popeyes restaurant system, or conviction of us or our executive officers for certain indictable offenses. We have not been notified of any events of default under any of our franchise agreements with BKC or PLK. 
In order to obtain a successor franchise agreement with BKC and PLK, a franchisee is typically required to make capital improvements to the restaurant to bring it up to BKC's or PLK's current image standards. The cost of these improvements may vary widely depending upon the magnitude of the required changes and the degree to which we have made interim improvements to the restaurant. At January 1, 2023, we had four Burger King franchise agreements due to expire in 2023, eight Burger King franchise agreements due to expire in 2024 and nine Burger King franchise agreements due to expire in 2025, as well as 52 that expired prior to the end of 2022. At January 1, 2023 we had one Popeyes franchise agreement set to expire in 2023, four Popeyes franchise agreement 
set to expire in 2024 and 12 Popeyes franchise agreements set to expire in 2025, as well as 13 Popeyes franchise agreements that expired prior to the end of 2022. 
As of January 1, 2023, we have certain franchise agreements that have expired. We are in ongoing discussions with BKC and PLK to establish mutually acceptable remodeling requirements and franchise extensions for those franchise agreements, although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. The expiration of certain franchise agreements prior to January 1, 2023 has not and is not expected to impact our continued operation of these restaurants. We believe that we will be able to satisfy BKC's and PLK's normal franchise agreement renewal criteria. Accordingly, we believe that renewal franchise agreements will be granted by BKC and PLK at the expiration of our existing franchise agreements. Historically, BKC has not denied our requests for successor franchise agreements. However, there can be no assurance that BKC and PLK will grant these requests in the future. 
In recent years, the historical costs of improving our Burger King restaurants in connection with franchise renewals, excluding scrape and rebuild projects, generally have ranged from $500,000 to $1,200,000 per restaurant. The average cost of our remodels in 2022 was approximately $1.2 million per restaurant. The cost of remodels can vary depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed. The cost of capital improvements made in connection with future franchise agreement renewals may differ substantially from past franchise renewals depending on the current image requirements established from time to time by BKC or PLK. 
We evaluate the performance of our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants on an ongoing basis. With respect to franchise renewals, such evaluation depends on many factors, including our assessment of the anticipated future operating results of the subject restaurants and the cost of required capital improvements that we would need to commit for such restaurants. If we determine that a Burger King or Popeyes restaurant is under-performing, or that we do not anticipate an adequate return on the capital investment required to renew the franchise agreement, we may elect to close such restaurant. We may also relocate (offset) a restaurant within its trade area and build a new Burger King or Popeyes restaurant as part of the franchise renewal process. In 2022, we closed ten Burger King restaurants, which did not include any offset locations. We currently expect to close between ten and fifteen restaurants in 2023, excluding any relocations of existing restaurants. Our determination to close these restaurants is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may also elect to close additional restaurants in the future. 
In addition to the initial franchise fee, we generally pay BKC and PLK a monthly royalty. The royalty rate for new Burger King restaurants and for successor franchise agreements is 4.5% of sales. The royalty rate for new Popeyes restaurants and for successor franchise agreements is 5.0% of sales. Royalty payments for restaurants acquired from other franchisees are based on the terms of existing franchise agreements being acquired, and may be less than 4.5%. Burger King royalties, as a percentage of restaurant sales, were 4.4% in 2022, 4.4% in 2021 and 4.3% in 2020. We anticipate our Burger King and Popeyes royalties, as a percentage of restaurant sales, will be approximately 4.5% in 2023 as a result of the terms outlined above. Newly constructed Burger King restaurants developed pursuant to the Area Development Agreement (the "ADA") dated May 1, 2019 among the Company, BKC and parties thereto as well as the Amended ADA received and will receive a 1% royalty rate reduction for a four year period and certain remodeled restaurants under the ADA generally received and will receive a 0.75% royalty rate reduction for a five year period.
We also generally contribute 4% of restaurant sales from our Burger King and Popeyes restaurants to fund BKC's and PLK's national and regional advertising. Pursuant to the Amended ADA, newly constructed Burger King restaurants will receive a 3% advertising contribution reduction for four years and certain remodeled restaurants, excluding upgrades, will receive a 0.75% advertising contribution reduction for a five year period. BKC and PLK engage in substantial national and regional advertising and promotional activities and other efforts to maintain and enhance both brands. From time to time we supplement BKC's marketing with our own local advertising and promotional campaigns. See "Advertising, Products and Promotion" below. 
Our franchise agreements with BKC and PLK do not give us exclusive rights to operate Burger King restaurants in any defined territory. Although we believe that BKC generally seeks to ensure that newly granted franchises do not materially adversely affect the operations of existing Burger King restaurants, we cannot assure you that franchises granted by BKC to third parties will not adversely affect any Burger King restaurants that we operate. 
Advertising, Products and Promotion
BKC's marketing strategy is characterized by its HAVE IT YOUR WAY® service, "You Rule.™" tag line, flame grilling, generous portions and competitive prices. Burger King restaurants feature flame-grilled hamburgers, the most popular of which is the Whopper sandwich, a large, flame-grilled hamburger topped with tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, and sliced onions on a toasted sesame seed bun. The basic menu of all Burger King restaurants also includes a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, including plant-based options, in addition to french fries, onion rings, soft drinks, breakfast items, snacks and other offerings. BKC and its franchisees have historically spent between 4% and 5% of their respective sales on marketing, advertising and promotion to sustain high brand awareness. BKC's marketing initiatives are designed to reach a diverse consumer base and BKC has continued to introduce several new and enhanced products to broaden menu offerings and drive guest traffic in all day parts.
PLK's marketing strategy is defined by its "It takes love" philosophy and "Love That Chicken®" from Popeyes' tagline. Popeyes restaurants feature a Louisiana-inspired home cooking styled menu including fried chicken, chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, fried shrimp and other seafood, red beans and rice and other regional offerings. 
BKC's and PLK's advertising programs consist of national campaigns supplemented by local advertising. BKC's and PLK's advertising campaigns are generally carried on television, digital and social media, radio and in circulated print media (national and regional newspapers and magazines). As a percentage of our restaurant sales advertising expense was 4.0% in 2022, 4.0% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2020. For 2023, we expect total advertising expense to be approximately 4.0% of total restaurant sales.
The efficiency and quality of advertising and promotional programs can significantly affect the quick-service restaurant businesses. We believe that one of the major advantages of being a Burger King franchisee is the value of the extensive national and regional advertising and promotional programs conducted by BKC. In addition to the benefits derived from BKC's advertising spending, we are able to supplement BKC's advertising and promotional activities with our own local advertising and promotions, including the purchase of geo-targeted digital display, radio and out-of-home advertising. The concentration of our Burger King restaurants in many of our markets permits us to leverage advertising in those markets. We also utilize promotional programs targeted to our guests, such as combination value meals and discounted prices in order to create a flexible and directed marketing program. 
In September 2022, BKC announced its "Reclaim the Flame" plan, which was developed in collaboration with its franchisees to accelerate sales growth and drive restaurant-level profitability. The plan includes Burger King investing $400 million through 2024, comprised of $150 million in advertising and digital investments to "Fuel the Flame" and $250 million for a "Royal Reset" involving investments in restaurant technology, kitchen equipment, building enhancements and high-quality remodels and relocations. 
In 2022, we entered into an agreement with BKC in connection with their "Reclaim the Flame" investment plan. Pursuant to this initiative, BKC has agreed to fund $120 million in additional advertising expenditures over the period October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Following the investment period in 2023 and 2024, participating franchisees, including us, have agreed to increase our advertising fund contributions by 50 basis points through 2026 if a profitability threshold for the Burger King system is met for the full fiscal year 2026, and further through 2028 if a secondary profitability threshold is met for the full fiscal year 2028, in order to continue the brand's elevated advertising spend.
Digital
BKC and PLK have invested heavily in launching a digital platform that integrates with major third-party delivery service providers and provides a seamless ordering, payment, delivery and drive-thru experience for our guests. In the BKC and PLK platforms, guests can place orders through a website or mobile app and have the product ready for pickup or delivered by a third-party partner. Digital sales, including sales through the delivery platforms plus mobile order and pay, have been a strong growth driver and represented approximately 7.5% of our restaurant sales in 2022 and 6.1% of our sales in 2021. As of January 1, 2023, we have installed outdoor digital menu boards at all Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. The digital menu boards integrate with the POS system and utilize artificial intelligence to help optimize the guest experience. BKC and PLK continue to invest in their digital platforms. In 2021, RBI introduced the Royal Perks loyalty program for Burger King and the Popeyes Rewards loyalty program for Popeyes to entice guests to visit more often as well as receive personalized offers on their respective mobile apps.
Suppliers
We are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Restaurant Services, Inc., which we refer to as "RSI", created for the Burger King system. RSI is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing our products and related supplies and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Burger King system. We use our purchasing power to negotiate directly with certain other vendors, to help obtain favorable pricing and terms for supplying our restaurants. For our Burger King restaurants, we are required to purchase all of our foodstuffs, paper goods and packaging materials from BKC-approved suppliers at prices negotiated by RSI. We currently primarily utilize four distributors, McLane Company Inc., Lineage Foodservice Solutions, LLC, Reinhart Food Service L.L.C and Performance Foodservice, to supply our Burger King restaurants with the majority of our foodstuffs. As of January 1, 2023, such distributors supplied 31%, 30% 29% and 10%, respectively, of our Burger King restaurants. Additionally, one bakery supplies the rolls used in approximately 50% of the Company's Burger King restaurants. 
For our Popeyes restaurants, we are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Supply Management Services, Inc. ("SMS"). SMS is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing certain of our products and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Popeyes system. Popeyes utilizes five distributors, five for poultry products and two for all other products. For our Popeyes restaurants, one distributor, Customized Distribution Services, supplies 69% of our poultry products and 91% of our non-poultry products.
We may purchase non-food items, such as kitchen utensils, equipment maintenance tools and other supplies, from any suitable source so long as such items meet BKC and PLK product uniformity standards. All BKC-approved and PLK-approved distributors are required to purchase foodstuffs and supplies from BKC-approved and PLK-approved manufacturers and purveyors. BKC and PLK are each responsible for monitoring quality control and supervision of the applicable manufacturers. Each conducts regular visits to observe the preparation of foodstuffs and to perform various tests to ensure that only quality foodstuffs are sold to its approved suppliers. In addition, BKC and PLK coordinate and supervise audits of approved suppliers and distributors to determine continuing product specification compliance and to ensure that manufacturing plant and distribution center standards are met. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply available to our restaurants, the failure of a distributor or supplier for our restaurants to service us could lead to a disruption of service or supply at our restaurants until a new distributor or supplier is engaged, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Quality Assurance 
Our operational focus is closely monitored to achieve a high level of guest satisfaction based on product quality, speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with BKC's and PLK's required operating procedures. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the premises and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute detailed reports measuring compliance with various guest service standards and objectives to our restaurant operations management team, including feedback obtained directly from our guests through instructions given to them at the point of sale. The guest feedback is monitored by an independent agency and us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have our own staff that handle guest inquiries and complaints. The level of guest satisfaction is a key metric in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans. 
We operate in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These standards include food preparation rules regarding, among other things, minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness. To maintain these standards, third-party firms under BKC's oversight conduct unscheduled inspections and follow-up inspections of our restaurants and report their findings to us. In addition, restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. 
Trademarks 
As a franchisee of Burger King and Popeyes, we also have contractual rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property relating to the Burger King and Popeyes concepts. We have no proprietary intellectual property other than the Carrols logo and trademark. 
Government Regulation 
Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or remodeled are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and remodeling of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as the handling, preparation and sale of food and beverages; the provision of nutritional information on menu boards; minimum wage requirements; unemployment compensation; overtime; and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. 
A significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the federal, and where applicable, state minimum wage. Accordingly, increases in the minimum wage have increased and in the future will increase wage rates at our restaurants. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Act") required businesses employing fifty or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health care benefits to those full-time employees or be subject to an annual penalty. Those benefits must be provided under a health care plan which provides a certain minimum scope of health care services. The Act also limits the portion of the cost of the benefits which we can require employees to pay. Based on our enrollment history to date, approximately 12% of our approximately 3,400 eligible hourly employees have opted for coverage under our medical plan.
We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the past.
Industry and Competition 
Limited-Service Restaurants. We operate in the hamburger and chicken categories of the limited-service restaurant segment of the restaurant industry. Limited-service restaurants are distinguished by high speed of service and efficiency, convenience, limited menu and service, and value pricing. We believe that limited-service restaurants are well-positioned to increase their sales in the current environment. According to the National Restaurant Association, the limited-service segment is projected to grow from $370 billion in 2022 to $395 billion in 2023, representing a projected 7% increase in sales and 40% of total restaurant and food industry sales.
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally-owned restaurants, offering low and medium-priced fare. We also compete with operators outside the restaurant industry such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias and other purveyors offering moderately priced and quickly prepared foods. Our competitors may also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and an emphasis on value menus. 
We believe that product quality and taste, brand recognition, convenience of location, speed of service, menu variety, price and ambiance are the most important competitive factors in the quick-service restaurant segment and that our restaurants effectively compete in each category. We believe our largest competitors for our Burger King restaurants are McDonald's and Wendy's and the largest competitors for our Popeyes restaurants are KFC and Chick-fil-A. 
Human Capital Management 
As of January 1, 2023, we employed approximately 24,300 persons, of which approximately 200 were administrative personnel and approximately 24,100 were restaurant operations personnel. Approximately 75% of our employees are part-time and 75% have been employed by the Company for less than one year. None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good and that our efforts to manage our workforce have been effective. 
Diversity. We are committed to fostering a culture that encourages diversity and inclusion, and having diverse representation in our workforce. As of January 1, 2023, 55% of our employees were female and approximately 55% of our employees self-identified as belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group. 
Training and Education. We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all of our personnel and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly restaurant personnel. Our program emphasizes, among other things, system-wide operating procedures, food preparation methods, food safety and guest service standards. BKC's and PLK's training and development programs are also available to us as a franchisee through web access in all of our restaurants. We also offer an educational assistance plan that provides full-time corporate staff, salaried employees and assistant managers up to $4,000 per year to take advantage of after-hour educational opportunities to improve their skills in their present position or prepare them to assume greater responsibilities within the Company.
Resources and Support. In response to the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we established the Carrols Cares Fund in April 2020 to provide financial assistance to employees in need. Since its launch, the Fund has evolved into a corporate-level initiative that provides assistance to more than just employees who have experienced hardship as a result of the pandemic, providing employees with support such as of bereavement expenses and financial relief after a house fire. During 2022, the fund provided more than $150,000 to support over 200 employees. We also support community-based organizations through our Matching Gift Program and our "Dollars for Doers" volunteer program.
