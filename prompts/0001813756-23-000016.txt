Who We Are
We are the leading global flexible workspace provider, serving a membership base of businesses large and small through our network of 779 Systemwide Locations (as defined below), including 622 Consolidated Locations as of December 2022. With that global footprint, we have worked to establish ourselves as the preeminent brand within the flexible workspace category, by combining prime locations and unique design with member-first hospitality and exceptional community experiences. Since 2020 under our CEO Sandeep Mathrani's leadership, we have refocused our business on the space-as-a-service model by eliminating non-core ventures and streamlining our operating model. We continue to focus on meeting the growing demand for flexibility, while operating efficiently with a cost-conscious mindset toward the goal of generating free cash flow coupled with profitability, digitizing real estate in order to enhance our product offerings, and expanding and diversifying our membership base.
Our mission is to empower tomorrow’s world at work.
History
In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, we opened our first location in lower Manhattan in 2010 to provide entrepreneurs and small businesses with flexible, affordable and community-centered office space. The initial vision was to create environments where people and companies could come together to do what they love. Our value proposition proved to be highly attractive to a range of members, which soon evolved to encompass a growing set of medium- and large-scale businesses, including our Enterprise Members.
Since its inception, we embarked on a high growth path towards global expansion. Within four years, the Company grew to 23 locations across eight cities and opened its first international locations in the United Kingdom and Israel. In 2019, we filed a registration statement in connection with an initial public offering transaction that was later withdrawn. Following the withdrawal of the registration statement related to the proposed initial public offering, SoftBank Group Corp. and certain affiliates thereof (collectively, "SBG") provided us with additional access to capital to support our day-to-day operations, among other things. Subsequently, our board of directors directed a change in leadership.
With a new leadership team comprised of seasoned professionals in the public and private sectors, in 2019, we began to execute a strategic plan to transform our business. This plan included robust expense management efforts, the exit of non-core businesses and material real estate portfolio optimization. Since 2019, we improved our cost structure, yielding significant results:
•    Approximately $2.0 billion decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding approximately $85 million of expenses attributable to ChinaCo, which has since been deconsolidated), including divestitures of non-core assets;
•    Approximately $10.7 billion reduction in aggregate future lease payments from the amendment and/or exit of over 700 leases, including ChinaCo prior to the ChinaCo Deconsolidation, as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2022; and
•    Over $2.5 billion improvement to Free Cash Flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2022 to Free Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2019 (excluding approximately negative $400 million in Free Cash Flow attributable to ChinaCo). Free Cash Flow is a measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Key Performance Indicators -— Free Cash Flow” for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP metric.
The Business Combination
On October 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), WeWork Inc. (formerly known as BowX Acquisition Corp. (“Legacy BowX”)), consummated its previously announced business combination pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 25, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Legacy BowX, BowX Merger Subsidiary Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy BowX, and New WeWork Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as WeWork Inc. (“Legacy WeWork”). As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (1) Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy WeWork, with Legacy WeWork surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy BowX (the “First Merger”), and (2) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, Legacy WeWork merged with and into BowX Merger Subsidiary II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub II”) and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy BowX (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”), with Merger Sub II being the surviving entity of the Second Merger. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Legacy BowX changed its name to WeWork Inc. and the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "WE".

Our Product Offerings
With a significantly improved cost structure and enhanced suite of flexible offerings, we believe that we are well-positioned to serve a shift toward greater workspace flexibility and capitalize on an anticipated post-pandemic rebound. Moving forward, our business strategy will center around three key areas: 
 1) our core space-as-a-service business;
 2) WeWork Access, including WeWork All Access and WeWork On Demand; and
3) our workspace management software solution for enterprises and operators, WeWork Workplace.
Core space-as-a-service offering
Our core business offering provides flexibility across space, time and cost. Whether users are looking for a workstation, a private office or a fully customized floor, our members have the flexibility to choose the amount of space they need and scale with WeWork as their business grows. Members also have the option to choose the type of membership that works for them, with a range of flexible offerings that provide access to space on a monthly subscription basis or through a multi-year membership agreement. In addition, a WeWork membership can provide members with portability of cost, giving our members the flexibility to move part or all of an existing commitment to a new market.
Memberships include access to space, in addition to access to certain amenities and services, such as private phone booths, internet, high-speed business printers and copiers, mail and package handling, front desk services, off-peak building access, unique common areas and daily enhanced cleaning. We also offer a range of value-add services designed to support businesses beyond their workspace needs. Currently, we offer business and technical service solutions, including professional employer organization (PEO) and payroll services, remote workforce solutions, human resources benefits, dedicated bandwidth, and IT equipment co-location. These ancillary services cater to the needs of our diverse member network, delivering additional revenue and margin to the Company and increasing member retention.
Beyond the amenities we offer through our memberships, our community team is what sets us apart from other space providers in the industry. With a member-first mindset, our community teams provide an exceptional level of hospitality by not only overseeing onsite operations and supporting day-to-day needs, but by also focusing on cultivating meaningful relationships with and between our members to deliver a premium experience.
Our core business offering has proven to be a compelling way for a broad range of businesses to manage their real estate footprint. Throughout our history, we have aimed to diversify our membership base with a focus on growing commitments from Enterprise Members, who typically enter into longer term agreements and often take space with WeWork across multiple countries using a master membership agreement.

WeWork Access
Operating our real estate portfolio of 779 Systemwide Locations has allowed us to take steps to make our network of locations digitally accessible to a global consumer base.
WeWork All Access: The WeWork All Access product, launched in late 2020, is a monthly subscription-based model that provides members with access to participating WeWork locations. Through WeWork All Access, members can book workspaces, conference rooms and private offices right from their phones – enabling users to choose when, where and how they work. Over time, assuming opt-in by our licensee partners, our goal is to expand this product by providing members with access to additional locations throughout the world.
WeWork All Access can be purchased by individuals and companies looking for flexible solutions for touch-down space in major urban centers where WeWork has a presence. The product also creates synergies with our space-as-a-service product and can be used together with a dedicated office space solution for enhanced flexibility.
In addition to being available for purchase by individuals and enterprise companies alike, WeWork All Access has also been promoted through a number of successful affinity partnerships with global businesses such as American Express Business and Uber. We believe that the WeWork All Access offering can drive Adjusted EBITDA growth for the Company by further monetizing the WeWork physical footprint and driving demand from a customer base that requires greater optionality and flexibility to the Company’s existing network of spaces.
WeWork On Demand: WeWork’s strategy to digitize its real estate began with the launch of the WeWork On Demand product in 2020, providing users with pay-as-you-go access to book individual workspace or conference rooms at nearby WeWork locations. Since the successful pilot program launch in New York City in 2020, we have expanded our WeWork On Demand offering across the United States and Canada as well as select markets in Europe and our Pacific region. 
WeWork Workplace
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trends that were previously driving the growth of flexible workspace and that the value proposition of a WeWork membership is more relevant than ever before. As many businesses are now returning to the office after working from home, many are looking for hybrid options that provide the flexibility to streamline their real estate footprints while also maintaining employee productivity and collaboration.
As a result, in order to service the market demand for flexible space, we believe a broader group of traditional real estate owners and operators will incorporate the flexible model that we developed into their own portfolios. 
Having spent more than 10 years building a global physical network and developing the systems necessary to operate our flexible products, we believe WeWork is well-positioned to offer landlords, operators, and enterprises a workplace management platform solution for their spaces through WeWork Workplace, a turnkey workspace management solution that leverages WeWork’s property and technology platform. This product enables landlords and operators to power flexible spaces and provide direct access to an established customer base. We believe it also provides enterprises with a seamless and purposeful hybrid work experience by powering online booking, providing meaningful utilization analytics, and 
optimizing space across assets. Third-party operators and enterprises pay us a recurring license fee to use WeWork Workplace, enabling us to scale via a capital-light business offering. 
In December 2021, WeWork signed its first WeWork Workplace enterprise deal to implement a robust desk-sharing program across locations in 34 cities that are a mix of WeWork locations, owned locations, and non-WeWork locations. In July 2022, the Company launched WeWork Workplace and as of December 2022, over 220 companies have signed onto WeWork Workplace, comprising over 42,000 licenses sold.
As the product gains traction, we believe that WeWork Workplace will provide a new line of revenue for our business while capitalizing on the shift towards flexible space that we are seeing among our landlord and enterprise partners.
Market Overview 
In a multi trillion-dollar commercial real estate market transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our global brand and network of locations position the Company as the leading flexible space provider.
On a square footage basis, we are one of the largest flexible space providers in the world, operating approximately 43.9 million rentable square feet globally as of December 31, 2022. Our total square footage in the United States and Canada region was 18.3 million rentable square feet as of December 31, 2022. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to flexible workspace, and will increase total flexible workspace penetration beyond these levels.
In many markets, we witnessed accelerated leasing activity in recent months. Although WeWork represented approximately 1% of the total commercial office stock in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2022, our leasing activity during the same period represented the equivalent of 23% of all commercial office leasing activity on a square-foot basis. Our leasing activity represented similar equivalent proportions of overall market leasing activity in other major markets, such as London, Dublin, Boston, and Miami. We believe this further demonstrates the shift to flexible office space in major markets.
We believe that our leadership position in flexible workspace, coupled with a shift in the way people now work, provides a unique and valuable opportunity to serve a growing asset class. Individuals and organizations are streamlining their real estate footprints in an effort to optimize cost structure and de-risk portfolios from long term leases and fixed costs. At the same time, companies are prioritizing the need to maintain productivity, connection and innovation of their workforce while also balancing the health and safety of their employees. As a result, WeWork’s global brand, exceptional real estate portfolio and spectrum of flexible solutions position the Company to meet the needs of employers and employees.
With regard to regions outside of the U.S., we believe that there is significant potential upside. We expect to grow market share globally over time and to continue to offer an expanding real estate portfolio of products and services to meet our members’ needs, driving higher margin revenue growth and further increasing our total addressable market.

•In March 2023, the Company entered into a series of agreements relating to the Transactions (as defined below), which, if and once implemented, would result in the reduction of the Company’s net debt by approximately $1.5 billion, extend maturity of the Company’s senior notes from 2025 to 2027 and result in additional new funding and rolled over capital commitments of approximately $1.0 billion. See “––The Transactions” below 
The Transactions
    In March 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Issuers (as defined below), entered into a transaction support agreement (the “Transaction Support Agreement”), a backstop commitment agreement, a securities purchase and commitment agreement and certain other support agreements (collectively, the “Transactions Agreements”) relating to a series of comprehensive Transactions with an ad hoc group (the “Ad Hoc Group”) of holders of 7.875% Senior Notes and 5.00% Senior Notes, Series II (each as defined below), SoftBank Vision Fund II-2 L.P. (together with its affiliates, “SVF II”), StarBright WW LP, a third party investor and certain other parties thereto, as applicable.
    Pursuant to the Transactions Agreements, the applicable parties have agreed to support, approve, implement and enter into definitive documents covering the following transactions, among other things (collectively, the “Transactions”): 
•certain offers to exchange, and related consent solicitations with respect to, all of the outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes and 5.00% Senior Notes, Series II, for a combination of newly issued 11.00% Second Lien Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2027 (with interest per annum payable 5.00% in cash and 6.00% by increasing the outstanding principal amount thereof (“PIK”)) of the Issuers (the “New Second Lien Notes”), 12.00% Third Lien Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2027 (with interest per annum payable in PIK only) of the Issuers (the “New Third Lien Notes”) and shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, and concurrently issue $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 15.00% First Lien Senior Secured PIK Notes due 2027 (with interest per annum payable 7.00% in cash and 8.00% in PIK) of the Issuers (the “New First Lien Notes”) in connection with the exchange offers, which amount will be backstopped by the Ad Hoc Group in exchange for a $25 million backstop fee payable in the form of additional New First Lien Notes;
•the exchange of all of the outstanding 5.00% Senior Notes, Series I (as defined below), held by StarBright WW LP (or any affiliate to which StarBright WW LP transfers its 5.00% Senior Notes, Series I) (a “SoftBank Noteholder”) for a combination of newly issued 11.00% Second Lien Senior Secured PIK Exchangeable Notes due 2027 (with interest per annum payable 5.00% in cash and 6.00% in PIK) of the Issuers (the “New Second Lien Exchangeable Notes”), 12.00% Third Lien Senior Secured PIK Exchangeable Notes due 2027 (with interest per annum payable in PIK only) of the Issuers (the “New Third Lien Exchangeable Notes” and, collectively with the New First Lien Notes, the New Second Lien Notes, the New Third Lien Notes and the New Second Lien Exchangeable Notes, the “New Notes”) and shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable; 
•the rollover of $300 million of the $500 million commitment from SVF II under the Secured NPA (as defined below) to purchase Secured Notes, including $250 million in aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes currently outstanding, into $300 million of New First Lien Notes, which, at the Company’s option, would be issued to SVF II in full and outstanding at the closing of the Transactions or issuable to SVF II from time to time in whole or in part pursuant to a new note purchase agreement (the “SoftBank Delayed Draw Notes”), subject to a 12.5% fee on up to $50 million in aggregate principal amount of New First Lien Notes outstanding and held by SVF II in excess of $250 million in the form of additional New First Lien Notes. In addition, during the period from the entry into the Transaction Support Agreement to the closing of the Transactions, the Company may draw upon the remaining $250 million in aggregate principal of Secured Notes, each draw subject to the terms of the Secured NPA and subject to the following schedule: (i) a draw request of $50 million which may be made no earlier than April 1, 2023; (ii) a subsequent draw request of no more than $75 million which may be made no earlier than May 1, 2023; (iii) another subsequent draw request of no more than $75 million which may be made no earlier than June 1, 2023; and, if applicable, (iv) a draw request of $50 million thereafter; and 
•the issuance of 35 million shares of Class A Common Stock in a private placement at a purchase price of $1.15 per share at closing of the Transactions and up to $175 million of New First Lien 
Notes issuable from time to time at the Company’s option pursuant to a new note purchase agreement to a third party investor (the “Third Party Delayed Draw Notes”), subject to a 12.5% fee on up to $50 million in aggregate principal amount of New First Lien Notes outstanding and held by the Third Party Investor in excess of $125 million in the form of additional New First Lien Notes. Any draw request by the Company under the SoftBank Delayed Draw Notes and the Third Party Investor Delayed Draw Notes shall be made as follows: (i) the first $250 million under the SoftBank Delayed Draw Notes and the first $125 million under the Third Party Investor Delayed Draw Notes shall be drawn ratably; and (ii) the final $50 million under each of the SoftBank Delayed Draw Notes and the Third Party Investor Delayed Draw Notes shall be drawn ratably.
Closing of any Transaction pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement is subject to, and conditioned upon, closing of all of the other Transactions as well as receipt of certain stockholder approvals with respect to the Transactions (the “Stockholder Approvals”). In connection with the entry into the Transaction Support Agreement, the Company and certain stockholders of the Company entered into support agreements pursuant to which each such stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote all of its shares of Class A Common Stock in favor of the Stockholder Approvals.
If implemented, the Transactions would significantly deleverage the Company’s capital structure and bolster liquidity for continued growth. See also “Risk Factors–– Risks Relating to the Company’s Financial Condition––The Company has a history of operating losses and negative cash flow and failure for the Company to fully consummate the Transactions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity and long-term prospects."
Global Operating Structure
To streamline operations and facilitate asset-light expansion outside of the United States, we sometimes enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships and other similar arrangements. As of December 2022, our operations in China, India, Israel, Japan, and certain countries in Latin America operate pursuant to such arrangements. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Going forward we expect to strategically evaluate the use of these alternative ownership arrangements on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis for all of our current and future locations.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our memberships and services to companies using a variety of sales and marketing efforts. We have sales representatives organized by market who engage directly with companies. We also have dedicated sales teams that target and service larger enterprise accounts across their global footprint.
Through the expansion of our WeWork On Demand and WeWork All Access products, we have invested in direct-to-consumer marketing capabilities, which we expect to expand over time to include capabilities in digital and social media retargeting.
Properties
We generally lease the real estate for our locations. As of December 2022, we had 779 Systemwide Locations across 39 countries, 259 of which are located in the United States, excluding our corporate headquarters at 75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY, 10019. See Note 28 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details regarding revenue concentration.
Intellectual Property
The recognition of the WeWork brand is an important component to our success. The Company has obtained a strategic set of intellectual property registrations and applications, including for the WeWork brand, throughout the world.
We police our trademark portfolio globally, including by monitoring trademark registries around the world and investigating digital, online and common law uses in order to learn as soon as possible whether the 
relevant parties engage in or plan to engage in conduct that would violate our valuable trademark rights. We monitor registries through the use of robust international subscription watch services, supplemented by periodic manual review. We typically discover or are informed of infringing uses of our trademarks through our internal policing system or by our employees.
We investigate and evaluate each instance of infringement to determine the appropriate course of action, including cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings, cybersquatting actions or infringement actions, if any. Wherever possible, we seek to resolve these matters amicably and without litigation.
In an effort to ensure that registries in countries where we operate or intend to operate remain clear of infringing trademark registrations, we frequently file opposition actions, cancellation actions and other administrative proceedings around the world.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and standards in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Like other market participants that operate in numerous jurisdictions and across various service lines, we must comply with a number of regulatory regimes. U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws, rules, regulations and standards include employment laws, health and safety regulations, taxation regimes and laws and regulations that govern or restrict our business and activities in certain regions and with certain persons, including economic sanctions regulations, anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws. Some of our offerings also require registrations, permits, licenses and/or approvals from governmental agencies and regulatory authorities, some or all of which may be costly or time consuming to obtain. A failure to obtain any such registrations, permits, licenses and/or approvals could subject us to penalties for noncompliance.
In addition, as a developer and operator of real estate, we are subject to local land-use requirements, including regulations that govern zoning, use, building and occupancy, regulations and standards that address indoor environmental requirements, laws that require places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to meet certain requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, and various environmental laws and regulations which may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases on, under, in or from such property.
Furthermore, because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of personally identifiable information received from or generated by our members, we are also subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy, use of personal data and cybersecurity.
Competition
The office space industry, including traditional offices, global real estate providers, regional flexible workspace options and home office spaces, is highly fragmented and is served by large, national or international companies as well as by regional and local companies of varying sizes and resources. As the industry has evolved over the past decade, a growing number of local, national and international competitors have entered the space, including flex office space operators and large office real estate owners that have developed unique flex office offerings within their own portfolios. We believe our differentiated expertise and global footprint offer a significant competitive advantage relative to alternative space providers that will uniquely position WeWork as a global partner of choice.
Human Capital Management
We recognize that people power our business and are at the center of all that we do. We have extraordinarily talented employees all across the world who are dedicated to serving our members and advancing our mission. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,300 employees, of which approximately 1,900 were located in the United States. A small portion of our employees outside of the 
United States are represented by a labor union or workers’ council and covered by collective bargaining agreements.
At WeWork, we also provide a competitive compensation package, with our base salary, cash bonus incentives and equity based awards designed to align with the market and delivered to employees based on eligibility and performance specific to their role. We provide a broad suite of market specific well-being programs for employees and their families, including company subsidized medical benefits, retirement/financial planning, work/life resources, paid leaves and mental health support, in addition to a range of personal and professional development opportunities, such as in-role training, live virtual sessions and access to on-demand learning resources.
We aim to create a workforce that promotes inclusion and fosters diversity. Our inclusion and diversity strategy focuses on proactively creating forums and designing resources to foster a culture of conversation, delivering training programs to increase understanding and change behaviors, and taking deliberate actions that strengthen our diversity pipeline. We support these initiatives through our inclusion and diversity governance structure, which includes a Global Diversity Leadership Council composed of executives and senior leaders, as well as an Office of Inclusion that sets our global inclusion and diversity strategy and supports our voluntary employee-led employee community groups.
