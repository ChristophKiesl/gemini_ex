Overview 
 TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. TripAdvisor, our flagship brand, is the world’s largest travel site, and its mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We accomplish this by, among other things, aggregating millions of travelers’ reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants worldwide, thereby creating the foundation for a unique platform that enables users to research and plan their travel experiences. Our platform also enables users to compare real-time pricing and availability for these experiences as well as to book hotels, flights, cruises, vacation rentals, tours, activities and attractions, and restaurants, on either a TripAdvisor site or app, or a travel partner site or app.
 Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites reached nearly 390 million average monthly unique visitors in our seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2016, according to our internal log files.  We currently feature approximately 465 million reviews and opinions on 7 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do – including 1,060,000 hotels and accommodations and 835,000 vacation rentals, 4.3 million restaurants and 760,000 activities and attractions worldwide.  
 In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate the following 23 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry: www.airfarewatchdog.com, www.bookingbuddy.com, www.citymaps.com, www.cruisecritic.com, www.familyvacationcritic.com, www.flipkey.com, www.gateguru.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.holidaywatchdog.com, www.housetrip.com, www.independenttraveler.com, www.jetsetter.com, www.thefork.com (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl, www.besttables.com, www.dimmi.com.au, and www.en.couverts.nl), www.niumba.com, www.onetime.com, www.oyster.com, www.seatguru.com, www.smartertravel.com, www.tingo.com, www.travelpod.com, www.tripbod.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and www.viator.com.
 Our Business Model 
 Our platforms connect users wishing to plan and book the best travel experiences with providers of travel accommodations and travel services worldwide. We manage our business in two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. We derive the majority of our revenue from our Hotel segment.
 Our Hotel business accounted for 80%, 85%, and 91%, of our Company’s consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and includes the following revenue sources:
  
• | Click-Based advertising and transaction revenue. Our largest source of Hotel segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to our partners’ sites. Our click-based advertising partners are predominantly online travel agencies, or OTAs, and direct suppliers in the hotel product category. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or “CPC”, basis, with payments from advertisers determined by the number of users who click on a link multiplied by the price that partner is willing to pay for that click, or hotel shopper lead. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process that enables our partners to use our proprietary, automated bidding system to submit CPC bids to have their hotel rates and availability listed on our site. Transaction revenue is generated from our instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission to TripAdvisor for a user that completes a hotel reservation on our website.

• | Display-Based and subscription-based advertising revenue. Advertising partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on our websites. Our display-based advertising clients are predominately direct suppliers of hotels, airlines

and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. We also accept display advertising from OTAs and attractions, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions, or “CPM” basis. Subscription-based advertising is offered to hotels, B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties. This advertising product is sold for a flat fee and enables subscribers to list, for a contracted period of time, a website URL, email address and phone number on our TripAdvisor-branded websites, as well as to post special offers for travelers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other hotel revenue. Our other hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as smartertravel.com, independenttraveler.com, and bookingbuddy.com, which includes click-based advertising revenue, display-based advertising revenue, hotel room reservations sold through these websites, and advertising revenue from making cruise reservations available for price comparison and booking.

 A significant percentage of our users are not hotel shoppers and visit TripAdvisor sites without navigating to pages that contain a listing of hotels in a particular city or a specific hotel’s page. These users contribute to our Non-Hotel segment revenue, which accounted for 20%, 15%, and 9% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consists of the following businesses, or operating segments: 
  
• | Attractions. We provide information and services for users to research and book activities and attractions in popular travel destinations through our dedicated attractions business, Viator. We generate revenue by charging the operators a commission for each transaction we facilitate through our online reservation systems. In addition to its consumer-direct business, Viator also powers activity and attractions booking capabilities to its affiliate partners, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains and online and offline travel agencies. Viator’s bookable inventory is available on www.viator.com as well as on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restaurants. Through our restaurant reservations business The Fork we provide information and services for users to research and book restaurants. The Fork is an online restaurant booking platform operating on a number of sites (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl, www.besttables.com, www.dimmi.com.au, and www.en.couverts.nl), with a network of restaurant partners primarily across Europe and Australia. The Fork generates revenue by charging our restaurant partners a fee for each restaurant guest, or seated diner, that we facilitate through our online reservation systems. The Fork also provides flexible online booking and a premium data and analytics tool, for which the restaurant owner pays a subscription fee. The Fork’s bookable inventory is also available on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vacation Rentals. We provide information and services for users to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full home rentals, condominiums, villas, beach rentals, cabins and cottages. The vacation rentals business generates revenue by offering individual property owners and property managers, the ability to list their properties on our websites and mobile applications through a free-to-list, commission-based option, and to a lesser extent, an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on a number of platforms, including www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, and www.vacationhomerentals.com, as well as on our TripAdvisor-branded websites.

Our Growth Strategy 
 We leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand-building, and relationships with advertisers and other partners to expand our business and enhance our global competitive position. We continue to focus on the following areas to grow our business: 

• | Delivering a Great User Experience. In 2016, in addition to completing the global instant booking rollout to all users on all devices worldwide, we also made it easier for users to find the best room prices on our site, whether offered through hotel metasearch or instant booking. We believe our continued progress in creating end-to-end travel solutions on our platform will result in better user experiences, and ultimately drive higher conversion to transactions for our partners and higher revenue per hotel shopper for our hotel business. Our innovative culture supports bringing product enhancements to market at speed. In doing so, we believe that we can continue to improve the user experience and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

engagement by growing, among other things, high-quality content, best room price availability on hotel listings, in-destination bookable supply, and real-time email and push notifications, thereby also enhancing our competitive positioning.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing Traffic to Our Platform. We seek to amplify our global brand and products through various online and offline performance-based marketing channels in order to increase the number of users who navigate to our site either directly, also known as domain direct traffic, or from other marketing channels. We have leveraged, at different points in time, a number of offline advertising channels, including permanent branding campaigns such as TripAdvisor-branded travel awards, certificates, stickers and badges and television advertising. We also leverage a number of online advertising channels, including: customer relationship management email campaigns, or “CRM”; social networks; “SEM”, which promotes websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results through paid placements, contextual advertising, and paid inclusions; and retargeting, which targets consumers based on their search behavior. In addition, for sources of user traffic, we rely on search engine optimization, or SEO, which promotes websites with relevant and current content that rank well in “organic,” or unpaid search engine results, as well as referrals from partners whose sites contain links to TripAdvisor content, badges or widgets. In order to continue growing unique visitors to our websites and enhancing the quality of those visits, we intend to invest in, some or all, of the aforementioned channels, as well as any new channels that we may identify in the future.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancing Our Mobile Offerings. Innovating and improving our mobile products is a key priority as mobile devices continue to proliferate and consumers increasingly conduct more internet searches and commerce on these devices. During the year ended December 31, 2016, nearly half of our average monthly unique visitors came from mobile phone, growing 29% year-over-year, according to our log files. We anticipate that the growth rate in mobile visitors will continue to exceed the growth rate of our overall monthly unique visitors, resulting in an increased proportion of users continuing to use their mobile devices to access the full range of services available on our websites and applications. We are investing significant resources to improve the features, functionality, engagement, and commercialization of our travel products on our mobile websites and applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals Businesses. A significant percentage of our users come to our websites for content on 760,000 activities and attractions, 4.3 million restaurants, and 835,000 vacation rentals, and we believe that continuing to build in-destination listings gives us a unique opportunity to delight users in more moments during more trips. We continue to execute this strategy and increase the stickiness of our products by investing in increasing bookable supply and strengthening our user engagement through our mobile platform. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Key Strengths 
 Our mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. In order to achieve this goal and our growth strategies, we leverage our key assets—a loyal travel community, rich user-generated content, end-to-end travel experience, continuous technological innovation and global reach—as follows: 

• | Loyal Travel Community. We believe that we have the largest breadth of travel-planning content in the global travel industry and, as a result, travelers gravitate to our websites to research and plan their trips. We view our large, highly engaged and loyal community of travelers as a valuable resource and provide them an interactive platform to share their experiences. After completing their trip, consumers can return to our websites to write reviews to give back to the community that helped them plan their trip. To encourage better experiences for travelers and to create a feedback loop between the hospitality industry and travelers, we engage hospitality management representatives to respond to reviews of their properties on our website. Through this cycle, more content is generated, which further drives community, traffic, loyalty and higher search engine rankings, all of which leads to additional content creation. We believe this sense of community among users and brand loyalty is a key competitive advantage for TripAdvisor.

• | Rich User-Generated Content. To help our users plan their trip, the TripAdvisor platform contains 465 million reviews and opinions as well as 90 million candid traveler photos on 7 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do. This valuable content creation reached 290 contributions per minute

in 2016, up approximately 40% from December 31, 2015. In addition, our tools and travel content are available to users around the world in 28 different languages on all devices, including mobile phone, desktop and tablet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | End-to-End Travel Experience. TripAdvisor products enable users to research, plan, price compare and book travel in a comprehensive, end-to-end fashion across a portfolio of 1,060,000 hotels, 835,000 vacation rentals, 4.3 million restaurants and 760,000 activities and attractions worldwide. In addition to user-generated content, our websites and applications feature price comparison tools and search functionality with links to partner websites, including travel advertisers, on which users can find and book their travel arrangements at the best prices. We also enable users to book hotels, activities and attractions and restaurant reservations on our site. These capabilities cover all phases of the travel experience, from pre-trip research and booking to in-destination booking to post-trip review submission.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology and Product. Continuous product testing and speed to market are two of our most important priorities, as they enable us to create a richer user experience. We operate on a regular product release cycle, where releases contain new product features for our websites and mobile applications. Our ongoing commitment to innovation also extends to content syndication and review collection partnerships, as we leverage our technology and content for the benefit of other websites. In addition, we utilize manual and electronic fraud detection in order to maintain the quality and authenticity of user reviews.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global Reach. We are a global company, evidenced both through the reach of our portfolio of branded websites and through our in-market staffing in 24 countries. As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,614 employees based outside of the United States, representing approximately 49% of our employee population. As of December 31, 2016, we had branded websites in 48 markets outside the United States in 28 languages. We have approximately 1.6 billion review translations, and are committed to continuing to improve the in-country user experience and the local content coverage for all of our points-of-sale. We believe that the universally-relevant content and community of our core TripAdvisor platform and our other brands uniquely position us to appeal to travelers throughout the world. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Industry 
 We operate in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel activity and the online advertising market.
 According to Phocuswright, global travel spending is expected to be greater than $1.3 trillion in 2017, or an increase of 5% over 2016. Recent trends show that, each year, an increasing percentage of global travel spending is conducted online through supplier websites and OTAs. We believe that this trend will continue as online penetration continues to grow, as more consumers around the world gain broadband access to the internet, as smartphone, tablets and other mobile computing devices continue to proliferate, and as travel activity increases along with an expanding middle class in certain countries like China and India. 
 We believe that the internet will continue to become even more integral to the travel-planning process due to increasing worldwide online penetration, particularly given the capabilities that the internet provides travelers, including the ability to refine searches, compare destinations, read and contribute user-generated content, view real-time pricing and determine availability, complete bookings, and access information while in-destination. 
 Travel-related advertisers continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels, mirroring the trend in consumer media consumption generally. Given the size and growth of the global travel market, as well as a growing percentage of travel transactions taking place online, we believe that travel-related businesses will continue to devote significant marketing dollars to online platforms in order to advertise their travel products and services. 
 Our Competition 
 We compete in rapidly evolving and competitive markets. We face competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services or what is known in the industry as hotel metasearch, and online 
 
5

reservations. In the competition to attract users to our platform, we rely on our ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as online search, email and television.  These marketing strategies can be impacted by competitive site content, changes to our website architecture and page designs, changes to search engine ranking algorithms, updates in competitor advertising strategies, or changes to display ordering in search engine results such as preferred placement for internal products offered by search engines.
 We compete with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies we participate in, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:
  
• | In our Hotel segment, we face competition from OTAs (including Expedia, Inc. and The Priceline Group, Inc. and certain of their respective subsidiaries), hotel metasearch providers (including Trivago, Kayak, Ctrip.com International, Ltd., and HotelsCombined), large online search, social media, and marketplace companies (including Google, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Facebook, Alibaba, and Amazon), traditional offline travel agencies, and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We also face competition in our Non-Hotel segment. Our Attractions business competes with traditional travel agencies, online providers, wholesalers, and individual tour operators. Our Restaurants business competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Yelp and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline), and local or regional providers. Our Vacation Rentals business competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations, including Airbnb and HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the industry shifts towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, including platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices, we anticipate that the existing competitive landscape will continue to change, new competitors may emerge, and industry consolidation may continue. 
 Our Commercial Relationships 
 We have a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of our business. Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, we work hard to ensure the mutual success of these relationships. 
 We have commercial relationships with the majority of the world’s leading OTAs as well as a variety of other travel suppliers pursuant to which these companies purchase traveler leads from us, generally on a click-based advertising basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our two most significant click-based and transaction advertising partners were Expedia and Priceline, including certain of their respective brands. 
 
Our instant booking feature enables hotel shoppers to book directly with a third-party partner, without leaving our website. To facilitate this user experience, we have entered into contracts with the majority of the world’s top hotel chains, including Accor, Best Western International, Carlson Rezidor, Choice Hotels, Hyatt Hotels, Marriott International, Hilton, and Wyndham Worldwide. We have also partnered with Priceline and Expedia whereby certain of their online travel brands participate in our instant booking feature.  As a result, users are able to book more than 560,000 hotels worldwide, powered by our partners, without leaving the TripAdvisor site or mobile experience.  
 Marketing and Promotions 
 Our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our brands, promote consumer engagement and contributions, drive qualified clicks to our partners and strategically position our brands in the market. Our long-term success depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of users flowing through our platform in a cost-effective manner, to engage users throughout the travel planning and booking phases, and to attract consumers who will share their reviews from their trips. We reach consumers across mobile and desktop devices through our online traffic acquisition programs, such as SEM, retargeting and online marketing campaigns, as well as through our offline brand campaigns. We also utilize our CRM channels by sending relevant and engaging communications to our members via email. We have a robust global public relations program that yields placements on a constant basis in major print and online publications. From 2013 to 2015, we invested in television advertising campaigns to promote the TripAdvisor brand as well as to publicize our new price comparison

and booking product features. During 2016, we began utilizing promotional campaigns, such as sweepstakes and giveaways, to educate and reward consumers for using our instant booking product. We continue to explore new ways to build brand awareness and growth in both new and existing marketing channels, which may include traditional media and social media channels including Facebook and Twitter to deepen user engagement. 
 Operations and Technology 
 We have assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers, and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations, and warehousing technologies. We make significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies. The TripAdvisor-branded websites are powered primarily using Java programming language. 
 Our systems infrastructure, web and database servers for TripAdvisor-branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software, and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of our software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. Our systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of our individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator, have their own data infrastructure and technology teams. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of our business. We rely on our intellectual property rights in our content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content, images, videos, graphics and brands. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties. These licenses and agreements may place restrictions on the use of our intellectual property. 
 We protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We protect our brands by pursuing the trademark registration of our core brands, as appropriate, maintaining our trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, we protect our trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program. 
 We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to a number of United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, libel, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to United States federal and state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. 
 
7

United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection, which could affect us. 
 In addition, we provide advertising data and information and conduct marketing activities that are subject to United States federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally. The United States and European Union have begun to adopt legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. 
 United States federal, state and foreign governments have considered from time to time alternative legislative and regulatory proposals that would increase regulation on internet advertising. It is impossible to accurately predict whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on our services, and whether or how we might be affected. Increased regulation of the internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operational results. 
 We are subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. In our processing of reservations, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data in the United States, Europe and Asia. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection Directive and variations and implementations of that directive in the member states of the European Union. The enactment, interpretation and application of these laws is in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. 
 Corporate History, Equity Ownership and Voting Control
 TripAdvisor was co-founded in February 2000 by Stephen Kaufer, our current President and Chief Executive Officer. In April 2004, TripAdvisor was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC. In August 2005, IAC spun-off its portfolio of travel brands, including TripAdvisor, into a separate newly-formed Delaware corporation called Expedia, Inc., or Expedia. On December 20, 2011 Expedia completed a spin-off of TripAdvisor into a separate publicly-traded Delaware corporation. We refer to this second spin-off transaction as the “Spin-Off.” Following the Spin-Off, on December 21, 2011, TripAdvisor began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, as an independent public company under the symbol “TRIP.”
 On December 11, 2012, Liberty Interactive Corporation, or Liberty, purchased an aggregate of 4,799,848 shares of common stock of TripAdvisor from Barry Diller, our former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, and certain of his affiliates. Following this transaction, Liberty beneficially owned 18,159,752 shares of our common stock and 12,799,999 shares of our Class B common stock. 
 On August 27, 2014, the entire beneficial ownership of our common stock and Class B common stock held by Liberty was acquired by Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., or LTRIP. Simultaneously, Liberty, LTRIP’s former parent company, distributed, by means of a dividend, to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock, Liberty’s entire equity interest in LTRIP. We refer to this transaction as the Liberty Spin Off. As a result of the Liberty Spin-Off, effective August 27, 2014, LTRIP became a separate, publicly traded company holding 100% of Liberty’s interest in TripAdvisor. 
 As a result of these transactions, as of December 31, 2016, LTRIP beneficially owned 18,159,752 shares of our common stock and 12,799,999 shares of our Class B common stock, which shares constitute 13.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock and 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Assuming the conversion of all of LTRIP’s shares of Class B common stock into common stock, LTRIP would beneficially own 21.5% of the outstanding common stock. Because each share of Class B common stock is generally entitled to ten votes per share and each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share, LTRIP may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing approximately 56.4% of our voting power.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Information 
 Our reporting structure includes two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. Our Non-Hotel reportable segment consists of three operating segments, which includes our Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals businesses.  The segments are determined based on how the chief operating decision maker regularly assesses information and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. Financial information related to our two reportable segments and geographic information required herein is contained in “Note 17 — Segment and Geographic Information,” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Expedia and Priceline, each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue and together accounted for 46%, 46% and 46% of our consolidated revenue, respectively.  Nearly all of this concentration of revenue is recorded in our Hotel segment for these reporting periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Expedia accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 3,327 employees. Of these employees, approximately 51% were based in the United States. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations.  
Seasonality 
 Traveler expenditures in the global travel market tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, expenditures by travel advertisers to market to potential travelers and, therefore, our financial performance, tend to be seasonal as well. As a result, our financial results tend to be seasonally highest in the third quarter of a year, as it is a key period for travel research and trip-taking, compared to the first and fourth quarters which represent seasonal low points. Further significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.
