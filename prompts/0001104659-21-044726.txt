ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to 890 5th Avenue Partners, Inc., except where the context requires otherwise.
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on September 9, 2020, as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (“Business Combination”). While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geography, we intend to focus on industries that align well with the relationships and experience of our team and sponsor. We will seek to capitalize on the exceptional operating experience, capital markets expertise and vast network of our management team and advisors across the technology, media and telecommunications sectors.
 
On October 15, 2020, our sponsor, 200 Park Avenue Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor”), purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which shares were later designated as shares of Class F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In December 2020, our Sponsor sold 621,222 Founder Shares to PA 2 Co-Investment LLC (“PA 2 Co-Investment”). In January 2021, our Sponsor sold an aggregate of 266,238 Founder Shares to Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (“Craig-Hallum”) and its affiliate and an aggregate of 105,000 Founder Shares to our independent director nominees (20,000 Founder Shares to each of Linda Yaccarino, Scott Flanders, David Bank and Jon Jashni, and 25,000 Founder Shares to Kelli Turner), in each case at their original per share purchase price. 937,500 of the Founder Shares were subject to forfeiture depending upon the extent to which the underwriters did not exercise their over-allotment option with respect to our Initial Public Offering (as defined below).
 
On January 14, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 28,750,000 units (“Units”), which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $287,500,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 777,500 units (the “Private Placement Units”) to our Sponsor, PA 2 Co-Investment, Craig-Hallum and John Lipman at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds to the Company of $7,775,000 (the “Private Placement”). In the Private Placement, our Sponsor purchased 657,500 Private Placement Units, PA 2 Co-Investment purchased 84,000 Private Placement Units, Craig-Hallum purchased 18,000 Private Placement Units and John Lipman purchased 18,000 Private Placement Units. The Private Placement Units are identical to the Units, except that the Private Placement Units (including the underlying securities) are subject to certain transfer restrictions and the holders thereof are entitled to certain registration rights, and, if held by the original holder or their permitted assigns, the underlying warrants (i) may be exercised on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to redemption and (iii) with respect to such warrants held by PA 2 Co-Investment, Craig-Hallum and John Lipman, will not be exercisable more than five years from the commencement of sales in the Initial Public Offering. If the Private Placement Units are held by holders other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, then the warrants included in the Private Placement Units will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering.
 
Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Placement Units, an aggregate amount of $287,500,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement has been placed in the trust account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering.

Transaction costs amounted to approximately $6,221,000 in the aggregate consisting of $5,750,000 of underwriting fees and approximately $471,000 of other offering costs. In addition, approximately $1,554,000 of cash was available for working capital purposes, unused portions of which are held outside of the trust account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering.
 
As a result of the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option in full, 937,500 of the Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
