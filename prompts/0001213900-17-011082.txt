Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
 
We provide one of the most popular content distribution platforms, worldwide, centered on self-expression, attracting both creators looking to promote their content and consumers who utilize such content to express their identity, feelings, tastes and interests. Users primarily access our content via our smartphone app, called Zedge, which offers an easy and modular way to customize smart phones. Depending on the phone’s mobile operating system, our Zedge app users are able to select personalization content from all or some of the following categories: ringtones, alarms, notification sounds, wallpapers, home screen widgets and app icons. In each category, we offer a wide array of high-quality, free content and content recommendations.
 
Our Zedge smartphone app, available in the Google Play and iTunes app stores, was installed over 273 million times and had more than 31 million monthly active users, or MAUs, as of July 31, 2017. Our Zedge app has averaged among the top 30 free applications in the Google Play store in the United States and in the iTunes Entertainment category for the past five years. MAU is a performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that opened our app in the previous 30-day period. Zedge has grown its user base without material investment in marketing, user acquisition or advertising.
 
According to a 2014 study conducted by Business Intelligence, mobile users want highly personalized smartphone experiences. Furthermore, in January 2016, Flurry Analytics revealed that personalization apps saw their sessions increase more than 332% in 2015. Although much of this growth was attributable to Emoji keyboards, the appeal for personalization is evident from their research. We believe that our Zedge app’s popularity stems from its ability to fulfill the demand for smartphone personalization by offering a large and diverse content catalogue, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience and rendering the content in a customized and personally relevant manner. To this end, we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy our user’s expectations. As a result of our Zedge app’s large, active user base, we offer advertisers, marketers, consumer brands and content providers, including, musicians, artists and brands a powerful way to engage with their prospects and customers.
 
Our Zedge app does all of this without handing over core elements of the native operating system to a third party or overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options. Once installed, the app does not require the user to utilize or install additional apps. As a result, the app provides an intuitive experience that allows the user to maintain the control that we believe he or she desires.
 
As of July 31, 2017, approximately 32% of our Zedge app’s user base was located in North America and 21% in Europe.
 
In addition to our Zedge app, we introduced a standalone wallpaper app in iTunes in March 2016 that offers free wallpapers, a standalone ringtone app in iTunes in December 2016 that offers free ringtones and a premium ringtone app in April 2017 that features for-purchase remixes of music from chart-topping artists.
 
We generate over 90% of our revenues from selling our advertising inventory to advertising networks, advertising exchanges, and direct arrangements with advertisers. Advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third-party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks. The price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through bidding on an advertising exchange. Advertisers are attracted to us because of our sizable user base and our focus on mobile phone personalization. The remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from our managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher, as well as overseeing the billing, collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher.
 
During fiscal 2017, we generated revenues of $10.0 million and loss from operations of $0.7 million, compared to revenues of $11.1 million and income from operations of $1.2 million in fiscal year 2016.
 
During fiscal 2017, MoPub (owned by Twitter) represented 43% of our revenue, Google represented 17% of our revenue and Facebook represented 10% of our revenue, as compared with 45%, 20% and 13%, respectively, during fiscal 2016.

Recent Developments
 
In September 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Release with Freeform Development, Inc. (“Freeform”) and certain of its former employees, pursuant to which we obtained releases for the employees from their Freeform employment agreements in exchange for the repayment of Freeform’s liabilities. We paid Freeform $125,000 in cash to pay its operating liabilities (with any excess to be refunded to us), and we paid the holders of Freeform’s convertible promissory notes cash of $97,567 and issued the noteholders a total of 126,679 shares of our Class B common stock, which are subject to a two-year lock-up agreement. In addition, we issued a total of 192,953 shares of our Class B common stock to former employees of Freeform and those employees entered into an Employment Agreement with us. The aggregate consideration paid by us was $833,000, consisting of cash of $223,000 and 319,632 shares of our Class B common stock with a fair market value of $611,000 on the date of issue. The 192,953 shares that were issued to former employees of Freeform employees vest equally over four years, contingent upon them remaining employees of Zedge.
 
As of November 16, 2016, we entered into a Foreign Exchange Agreement with Western Alliance Bank to allow us to enter into foreign exchange contracts not to exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate at any point in time under its revolving credit facility. The available borrowing under the revolving credit facility is reduced by an applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage as determined by Western Alliance Bank, in its reasonable discretion from time to time, which was initially set at 10% of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange contracts in effect at the relevant time. In December 2016, the applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage was changed so that the reduction of available borrowing for major currency forward contracts of less than six months tenor is set at 10% of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange contracts, and for contracts over six months tenor, 12.5% of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange contracts. At July 31, 2017, there were $2.0 million of outstanding foreign exchange contracts with less than six months tenor under the credit facility, and no contracts of greater than six months tenor, which reduced the available borrowing under the revolving credit facility by $200,000.
 
In September 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank for a revolving credit facility of up to $2.5 million. Advances under this facility may not exceed the lesser of $2.5 million or 80% of our eligible accounts receivable subject to certain concentration limits. The revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. The principal outstanding bears interest per annum at the greater of 3.5% or the prime rate plus 1.25%. Interest is payable monthly and the facility matures in September 2018. We are required to pay an annual facility fee of $12,500 to Western Alliance Bank. We are also required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain financial ratios during the term of the revolving credit facility, including we may not pay any dividend on our capital stock. We may terminate this agreement at any time without penalty or premium provided that we pay down any outstanding principal, accrued interest and bank expenses. At July 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants.

Our History
 
In 2003, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes and Paul Shaw launched a consumer website that people could use to upload and download ringtones. Traffic to the website grew, primarily by word of mouth, drawing customers from the emerging markets. In December 2006, IDT acquired 90% of Zedge Limited, a UK-based company. Zedge Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2008.  On September 18, 2008, Zedge Limited, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes and IDT entered into a Conversion Agreement, converting the equity in Zedge Ltd. to Zedge Holdings, Inc. and on September 23, 2008, IDT purchased 94,750 shares of Zedge Holdings’ Series B Preferred Stock for $1,000,000.
 
In 2010, IDT and Shaman II, L.P. invested an additional $1.7 million in Zedge Holdings, Inc. Over a two-year period in 2011 and 2012, IDT and Shaman II, L.P. invested an additional $2.35 million in Zedge Holdings, Inc. In January 2016, Zedge Holdings, Inc.’s name was changed to Zedge, Inc.
 
In late 2009, we introduced our Android Zedge app. The Zedge app provided ease-of-use by negating the need for the customer to first download a ringtone or wallpaper to their computer and then upload that content to their mobile phone.
 
In late 2011, Tom Arnoy was promoted to our Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Reich was retained as our Chief Operating Officer. We improved our underlying technology. We launched our iOS Zedge app in 2013, followed by launch of our Windows Mobile Zedge app in 2014.
 
During 2014 and 2015, our Zedge app introduced app icons, social sharing features and marketing automation capabilities. In addition, we began localizing our Zedge app by not only expanding the number of languages it supported but also by launching localized versions of its Google Play listings. As of July 31, 2016, our Zedge app is available in the following 12 languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish.
 
Our Technology
 
We have developed a scalable distributed platform that is comprised of both open source and proprietary technologies centered on content management and discovery, web and app development, data mining and analytics, deep learning, mobile content/device compatibility, advertising and reporting. From an end user’s perspective, the platform minimizes response latency while maximizing content relevancy and discoverability. We optimize by utilizing systems, algorithms and heuristics that organize the content based upon real user data and that render the content in a relevant fashion. Our architecture provides a fully redundant production environment that can tolerate multiple server failures with minimal end-user disruption. It utilizes a variety of bare-metal and cloud-hosted servers and services; a mix that we find gives the right balance between performance, scalability, flexibility, cost and ease of use.
Competition
 
Our Zedge app faces competition across many different fronts including:
 

● | Mobile personalization products. Generally, our Zedge app competes with other mobile app developers. More specifically, ringtones, wallpapers and app icons are a commodity, and many smaller app developers and websites offer both free and paid ringtones, wallpapers and app icons. In addition, other Android apps offer users a limited set of similar personalization options when compared to our Zedge app. We believe that our Zedge app has a competitive advantage in this space due to its large user base, its modular approach that allows the customer to selectively choose what they would like to personalize without handing over the core elements of the native operating system to a third party and overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options, its large content catalogue, its proprietary recommendation engine, its market ranking and its longevity. We are unaware of any service that hosts a content library as extensive as our Zedge app’s library, or that curates the content in such a relevant and easy-to-use fashion. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advertisers. We face significant competition for advertising spend on our Zedge app from both digital media providers and traditional media outlets, including television, radio and print.
