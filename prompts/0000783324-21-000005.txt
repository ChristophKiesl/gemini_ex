ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
​
Overview
​
Vista Gold Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Vista,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) operates in the gold mining industry. We are focused on evaluation, acquisition, exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements with other mining companies, or outright sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration. We look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling and/or technical studies focused on optimizing previous engineering work. We do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations.
​
The Company’s flagship asset is its 100% owned Mt Todd gold project (“Mt Todd” or the “Project”) in Northern Territory, Australia. Mt Todd is the largest undeveloped gold project in Australia and, if developed as presently designed, is projected to produce an estimated 5.3 million ounces of gold from proven and probable reserves over a 13-year mine life.
​
We have invested nearly $100 million to systematically explore, evaluate, engineer, permit and de-risk Mt Todd since we acquired it in 2006. These efforts have:

● | more than quadrupled reported measured and indicated gold resources (inclusive of gold reserves) (1);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established proven and probable gold reserves of 5.85 million contained gold ounces(1);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | led to adopting industry-proven processing technologies that demonstrate gold recoveries in excess of 90%;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | validated major mining and processing methods and costs of the Project; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established Vista as a leader in environmental and community stewardship in Northern Territory, Australia.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
(1) - See “Cautionary Note to Investors Regarding Estimates of Mineral Reserves and Resources” and the information under the heading “Project Updates – 2019 PFS” of this discussion and analysis for further information.
​
We believe this work has added substantially to the value of the Project, which reflects a $1.6 billion net present value (NPV5%) at the recent gold price of $1,800 per ounce and a 0.775 AUD:USD exchange rate and demonstrates near-term development potential. See the “Gold Price and Foreign Exchange Sensitivity Table” below.
​
In September 2019, Vista announced the positive results of an updated preliminary feasibility study for Mt Todd and subsequently amended this study in September 2020 to correct and/or clarify certain items (the “2019 PFS”). Key improvements reflected in the 2019 PFS included increased estimated gold recovery and production, and selection of vertical milling equipment that is expected to be best suited for anticipated grinding requirements and to reduce energy consumption. Mt Todd will benefit from these improvements, other design efficiencies, and utilization of certain existing infrastructure, which reduced the Project’s estimated development costs.
​
Vista continues to advance and de-risk Mt Todd. An ongoing geologic evaluation, while still preliminary, is focusing on the Batman deposit and the area northeast to the Quigleys deposit. Findings to date indicate district-scale resource potential as supported by our better understanding of the continuity of gold mineralization along a 5.4 Km strike length. As we evaluate this potential, Vista commenced an eight-hole, 2400-meter proof of concept drilling program in the fourth quarter of 2020 to test targets known as the Batman Hanging Wall Lode and the Batman North Extension, with the goal of the program to test the expected existence of mineralization with vertical and lateral continuity within and immediately adjacent to the planned Batman pit. Results from hole 1 (VB20-001) in the Batman Hanging Wall Lode were reported in December 2020 and confirmed our interpretation.
​
In January 2021, drill results from holes 2, 3 and 4 (VB20-002, 003 and 004) confirmed the extension of the Batman Core Zone to the north, as expected. Drilling continues on the remaining holes, with completion and results expected this quarter. Results so far suggest that additional drilling could lead to an increase in the mineral resource estimates both within and outside the current design of the Batman pit. We are presently evaluating targets for a follow-up drill program with the 

11



objective to confirm continuity and connectivity of the mineralized structures extending northeast to the Quigleys deposit. Based on this potential, Vista is now targeting a mine life extending longer than the current 13 years. Other ongoing programs are in process and planned to further improve Mt Todd’s near-term development potential and evaluate additional optimization opportunities.
​
In addition to the technical advancements of the Project, Vista has all major environmental permits in hand. The Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") for Mt Todd was approved by the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Authority (“NT EPA”) in September 2014. In its formal notification to the Company, the NT EPA advised that it has assessed the environmental impacts of the Mt Todd project and concluded that it can proceed, subject to a number of recommendations outlined in the Assessment Report. Subsequently, the Company undertook to complete these recommendations. In January 2018, we announced that the “authorization of a controlled activity” at Mt Todd, as required under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, as it relates to the Gouldian Finch, had been approved by the Australian Commonwealth Department of Environment and Energy.
​
In November 2018, we applied for approval of the Mining Management Plan (“MMP”), which is the operating permit that sets out how the mine operating strategy will be implemented throughout the mine life. The MMP is currently in the process of final review by the Northern Territory Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade (“DITT”). 
​
We have invested significant resources in water treatment and management, environmental, and social programs. We believe this has benefited our relationships with the traditional aboriginal land owners, local communities, and Northern Territory Government, creating a strong social license.
​
Vista is well positioned to engage with potential partners and identify strategic opportunities to advance the development of Mt Todd in a way that preserves maximum Project ownership for our shareholders, while minimizing future dilution.
​
Vista holds a number of non-core assets, some of which have been monetized to generate working capital to support ongoing operations in a non-dilutive manner. Among these assets were common shares of Midas Gold Corp. (“Midas Gold Shares”). In April 2011, we contributed our Yellow Pine assets in Idaho to Midas Gold Corp. and participated in a concurrent private placement that resulted in Vista owning 31.8 million Midas Gold Shares. Total consideration paid by Vista was $4,300. Since acquisition through December 31, 2020, Vista monetized all 31.8 million Midas Gold Shares for net proceeds of $19,533, including $5,788 received during 2020.
​
In addition, Vista received net proceeds totaling $3,408 during 2020 from the sale of its interests in the Guadalupe de los Reyes gold and silver project (“Los Reyes”) and Awak Mas gold projects, and has agreements in place to realize up to an additional $4,600 relating to the buyout of royalty rights under these agreements over the next nine months. Management continues to seek opportunities to monetize other non-core assets, which include mill equipment not in use and listed for sale, a royalty interest, and holdings of listed equity securities. Management’s objective is to continue to monetize non-core assets as a means to generate working capital in a non-dilutive manner.
​
Vista was originally incorporated on November 28, 1983 under the name “Granges Exploration Ltd.” It amalgamated with Pecos Resources Ltd. during June 1985 and continued as Granges Exploration Ltd. In June 1989, Granges Exploration Ltd. changed its name to Granges Inc. Granges Inc. amalgamated with Hycroft Resources & Development Corporation during May 1995 and continued as Granges Inc. Effective November 1996, Da Capo Resources Ltd. and Granges, Inc. amalgamated under the name “Vista Gold Corp.” and, effective December 1997, Vista continued from the Province of British Columbia to the Yukon Territory, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon Territory). On June 11, 2013, Vista continued from the Yukon Territory, Canada to the Province of British Columbia, Canada under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

Human Capital Management
​
As of December 31, 2020, we had 14 full-time and no part-time employees globally. In addition, we use consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of our corporate affairs, project evaluation, due diligence, corporate governance and property management. 
​
Our compensation programs are designed to align compensation of our employees with Vista’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances competitive wages and benefits and incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance.
​
The health and safety of our employees and others is a key priority in the way we manage our business. Oversight is provided by the Company’s Board of Directors through the Health, Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility Committee. Management utilizes the principles set out in our Health & Safety Policy to administer health and safety programs. Employees and others entering our workplaces are provided with relevant orientation and required to adhere to established site protocols. In addition to recurring health and safety considerations, the Company has responded to workplace challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures implemented include, among others: work-from-home flexibility, on-site staffing limits, social distancing, additional surface cleaning procedures, installation of air sanitization equipment, and accommodation of specific needs for high-risk employees or family members.
​
Vista’s priority to maintain a culture of ethical performance as a core value is reflected in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other related policies. Oversight is provided by the Company’s Board of Directors and, for specific areas of performance, by committees of the Board of Directors. Employees are required to review the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on a periodic basis. Our compensation programs also include consideration of ethical performance in determining incentive awards.
​
​
Segment Information
​
We have one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Australia. We evaluate, acquire, explore and advance gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or value adding strategic transactions such as earn-in right agreements, option agreements, leases to third parties, joint venture arrangements, or outright sales of assets. We reported no operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Notes 4 – Mineral Properties and 5 – Plant and Equipment to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.
​
Reclamation
​
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.
​
The Mt Todd site was not reclaimed when the mine closed in the late 1990s. Liability for the reclamation of the environmental conditions existing prior to the 2006 commencement of Vista’s involvement with the Project remains the responsibility of the NT Government until after we have provided notice to the NT Government that we intend to proceed with development and assume rehabilitation liability for Mt Todd. Vista does not expect to give such notice until a project development decision has been made, the Project is fully permitted to construct the mine, and necessary financing for Project construction has been arranged. 
​
Vista maintains a $240 provision for potential reclamation costs attributable to certain mining claims previously held by the Company should no other potentially responsible parties be identified.

Government Regulation
​
Our exploration and development activities and other property interests are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in Australia and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, mine safety, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, the use and disposal of hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. With the exception of previously held claims noted above, management of the Company is not aware of any current orders or directions relating to the Company with respect to the aforementioned laws and regulations. 
​
Australia Laws 
 ​
Mineral projects in the NT are subject to Australian federal and NT laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and the use and disposal of hazardous wastes and materials. As with all mining projects, Mt Todd is expected to have a variety of environmental impacts should development proceed. In Australia, environmental legislation plays a significant role in the mining industry. We are required under Australian laws and regulations (federal, state and territorial) to acquire permits and other authorizations before Mt Todd can be developed and mined. In September 2014, the environmental impact statement (“EIS”) for Mt Todd was approved. The Environmental Protection Agency of the Northern Territory Government (“NTEPA”) advised that it had assessed the environmental impacts of the proposed gold mine at Mt Todd and authorized the Company to proceed with development, subject to a number of recommendations as outlined in the assessment report (the “Assessment Report”). The Assessment Report included a request for Vista to secure an authorization under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (“EPBC”) as it relates to the Gouldian Finch. In January 2018, the authorization under the EPBC was approved by the Australia Department of the Environment and Energy. We must comply with the terms of our Authority Certificate under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 which deals with the handling of archeological material within sacred sites. We are also subject to statutory requirements under the Mining Management Act, which includes the requirement to receive authorization of a Mining Management Plan (“MMP”) before the start of mining operations. The Mt Todd MMP was formally submitted in November 2018 and is under review by the DITT. 
​
Environmental Regulation
​
Our projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
​
Changes to current local, territorial, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, or what additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
​
During 2020, none of our project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations. See “Item 1. Business – Reclamation” above. 
​
Competition
​
We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of gold properties. There is competition among mining companies for a limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities. Some of these competing mining companies have substantially greater financial and technical resources than Vista. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices. We compete with other mining companies to retain expert consultants required to complete our geological and project development studies. 

14



We also compete with other mining companies to hire mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry, and for exploration and development services.
​
Gold Price History
​
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold supply and demand, and political and economic conditions.
