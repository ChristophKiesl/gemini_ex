Construction Products.
Markets
Our Construction Products segment provides products that are used in various segments of construction activity, including infrastructure, residential, non-residential, and specialty/other end markets. 
Infrastructure Construction: Over a multi-year horizon, we believe that approximately half of our current portfolio of construction materials are used in infrastructure projects, which include construction spending by federal, state, and local governments for roads, highways, bridges, airports, and other public infrastructure projects, as well as private spending on road and utility construction.
The other half of our construction materials demand is split across residential, non-residential, and specialty/other end markets. 
Residential Construction: Residential construction includes single family homes and multi-family units such as apartments and condominiums. Demand for residential construction is influenced primarily by population growth, new household formation, and mortgage interest rates.
Non-Residential Construction: Non-residential construction includes a wide variety of privately-financed construction including manufacturing and distribution facilities, industrial complexes, office buildings, and large retailers and wholesalers. Demand for non-residential construction is driven primarily by population and economic growth, in addition to segment-specific factors such as the growth of e-commerce, changes in retail patterns, changes in office occupancy trends, and numerous other factors.
Specialty / Other: Our products are used in various other end markets including energy-related activity such as drilling pads, roads and major downstream projects, agriculture/horticulture, and industrial uses.
In 2020, we had shipments of 22 million tons of aggregates and specialty materials. Texas is our largest geographic market, representing approximately 60% of the segment's revenues in 2020. We primarily serve the Texas Triangle formed by the Dallas-Fort Worth metro at its northern point in North Texas; the Houston metro at its southeastern edge on the Gulf Coast; and Austin-San Antonio at its western tip in Central Texas. The outlook for construction spending in Texas is favorable, supported by increased spending on highways near-term, with current fiscal year planned Texas Department of Transportation lettings up 35% to approximately $9.5 billion, and a robust long-term outlook supported by the state’s 10-year Unified Transportation Program identifying approximately $75 billion of infrastructure projects. Population and household formation growth have contributed to a strong residential housing market, with housing permits, an indication of future construction activity, up 35% in Texas in during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to last year. Non-residential construction activity, while currently negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, generally follows a strong residential construction cycle on a lagged basis.
Products, Customers, and Competitors
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Construction Products segment produces and sells natural and recycled aggregates, specialty materials, and construction site support equipment, including trench shields and shoring products. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to aggregates and specialty materials.
We are an established producer and distributor of natural aggregates serving both public infrastructure and private construction markets with active open pit quarries in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Florida, Nevada, Washington, and British Columbia. Our natural aggregates products include sand, gravel, limestone, gypsum, stabilized material, and various other products used in the production of ready mixed concrete, cement, and other precast concrete products, roads, municipal and private water, sewer, and drainage projects, oil and gas well pads, wind farms, as well as various other building products. 
To expand and complement our natural aggregates platform, we completed several natural aggregate bolt-on acquisitions and two larger acquisitions that added natural aggregates and introduced recycled aggregates to our product portfolio. In January 2020, we completed the acquisition of Cherry Industries, Inc. and affiliated entities (collectively “Cherry”), a leading producer of natural and recycled aggregates with multiple locations in the Houston, Texas market. Cherry’s natural aggregates quarries produce stabilized sand, a unique mixture of cement, water, and sand primarily used as backfill material in topography that requires additional reinforcement, like in the Gulf Coast region, and flex base that is used in road construction. 
Cherry is also a leading producer of recycled aggregates in the U.S. with multiple stationary crushing locations and portable on-site crushing capabilities across the Houston, Texas market. Recycled aggregates are a substitute to natural aggregates and currently supply a very small but growing percent of aggregate use due to resource scarcity and ESG benefits. Recycled aggregates are produced by crushing concrete reclaimed from demolished highways, buildings, and other structures, processing to remove steel, rebar, shingles and other debris, and screened to appropriate sizes for use as road base, erosion control for building foundations, and as backfill for utility trenches. Recycled aggregates are growing in acceptance due to reduced disposal of concrete in landfills, conservation of natural resources, reduced cost for raw materials, and energy savings from less processing and transportation costs.
In October 2020, we further expanded our recycled aggregates footprint with the acquisition of Strata Materials, LLC (“Strata”), a leading provider of natural and recycled aggregates in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas market. Strata brings five stationary crushing locations and adds one natural aggregates quarry to our Dallas-Fort Worth footprint. 
The Cherry and Strata acquisitions help advance our strategy of serving customers with a complementary product offering that includes both natural and recycled aggregates. 
Our customers include concrete producers; commercial, residential, highway, and general contractors; manufacturers of masonry and building products; and state and local governments. Shipments of natural and recycled aggregates from an individual quarry or stationary crushing location are generally limited in geographic scope because the cost of transportation to customers is high relative to the value of the product itself. Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets and, in certain locations, offer portable crushing services at a job site for re-use onsite. Proximity of our active quarries, stationary crushing locations, and strategic reserves to demand centers serve as barriers to entry.
The U.S. aggregates industry is a highly fragmented industry with more than 5,200 producers nationwide. We compete, in most cases, with natural and recycled aggregates producers in the regions where we operate. Many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to extend their existing market positions or enter new markets.
Our specialty materials, including lightweight aggregates and milled or processed specialty building products and agricultural products, are produced and distributed nationwide. We currently operate in ten states across the U.S., with several of our production facilities operating at the quarries that produce the raw material inputs. Our specialty materials products enjoy higher barriers to entry than our natural aggregates due to specific mineral properties, specialized manufacturing, or additional processing. Lightweight aggregates are select shales or clays that are expanded and hardened by high temperatures in a rotary kiln and possess a bulk density that can be less than half that of natural aggregates. Product applications include structural lightweight concrete, lightweight masonry block, and road surface treatments. Our specialty building products and agricultural products are processed at several production facilities across the U.S., mostly using our natural aggregates as a component of raw material supply. Product applications include plasters, prills, agricultural supplements and fertilizers, paints, flooring, glass, ingredients for food and feed, and other products. Due to the added value in processing, specialty materials have a much wider, multi-state distribution area due to their higher value relative to their distribution costs as compared to natural and recycled aggregates. Therefore, we compete with specialty materials producers nationwide.
We hold a strong market position in the manufacture of trench shields and shoring products for the U.S. construction industry. Trench shields and shoring products are used for water and sewer construction, utility installations, manhole work, oil and gas pipeline construction, and other underground applications. Our customers are equipment rental dealers and commercial, residential, and industrial contractors. Additionally, we participate in certain regional rental markets for trench shoring equipment. We compete with shoring products manufacturers nationwide.
Raw Material and Suppliers
The primary raw material for our natural aggregates and specialty materials comes from quarries. Natural aggregates and specialty minerals can be found throughout the U.S. We have a proven and successful track record of securing long-term reserve positions for both current and future mine locations through our employment of exploration teams and the use of professional third parties. Our reserves are critical to our raw material supply and long-term success. We currently estimate that we have 780 million tons of proven and probable natural aggregates and specialty materials reserves strategically located in favorable markets that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. For further discussion of our natural aggregates and specialty materials reserves, please refer to Item 2. “Properties.”
The primary raw material for recycled aggregates is demolished concrete. We source raw material both internally and externally primarily from demolition and road removal projects. The demolished concrete feedstock is reported as inventory and passes through raw material, work in process, and finished goods inventory as we process it into recycled aggregates. We control a portion of our raw materials needs through demolition services that we provide and source the remainder from third parties. Due to increasing landfill scarcity, in certain markets, landfills restrict the acceptance of demolished concrete, increasing the availability of raw product at our crushing locations. Our operating permits allowing recycling activities and the strategic location of our stationary crushing sites are competitive advantages. 
Engineered Structures.
We have renamed this segment as of December 31, 2020 from Energy Equipment to better reflect the products delivered. There have been no changes to the businesses that have historically comprised this segment.
Markets
Our Engineered Structures segment serves a broad spectrum of infrastructure markets, including electricity transmission and distribution, wind power generation, highway road construction, wireless communication, and the storage and transportation of gas and liquid products for use in residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial end markets. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from significant upgrades in the electrical grid to support enhanced reliability, policy changes encouraging more generation from renewable energy sources, the expansion of new transmission, distribution, telecommunication infrastructure, and the replacement and growth of the U.S. highway and road system.
Products, Customers, and Competitors
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Engineered Structures segment manufactures and sells primarily steel structures for infrastructure businesses, including utility structures for electricity transmission and distribution, structural wind towers, traffic structures, and telecommunication structures. These products share a similar manufacturing competencies and steel sourcing requirements, and can be manufactured across our North American footprint. This segment also manufactures storage and distribution tanks. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to our engineered structures products.
We are a well-established manufacturer in the U.S. and Mexico of engineered steel utility structures, including tapered steel and lattice structures, for electricity transmission and distribution. Through our recognized brands, we have developed strong relationships with our primary customers, public and private utilities. We compete with both domestic and foreign manufacturers on the basis of product quality, engineering expertise, customer service, and on-time delivery of the product. Sales to our customers, particularly certain large utility customers, are often made through alliance contracts that can extend several years. We also sell into the competitive-bid market, whereby the lowest bidder is awarded the contract, provided all other qualifying criteria are met. To a lesser extent, we also manufacture pre-stressed concrete poles for low voltage utility, lighting, transportation, and telecommunications markets. We acquired static cast concrete pole manufacturing competency through an acquisition in June 2020, and we believe there are opportunities to expand organically and through acquisition.
We are one of the leading manufacturers of structural wind towers in the U.S. and Mexico with five plants strategically located in wind-rich regions of North America. Our primary customers are wind turbine producers and we compete with both domestic and foreign producers of towers. Revenues from General Electric Company (“GE”) included in our Engineered Structures segment constituted 15.3%, 18.2%, and 19.4% of consolidated or combined revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 
Demand for new wind energy projects in the U.S. has been supported by the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) that was first introduced in 1992, providing a tax credit for electricity produced at each qualifying wind project. Since inception, the PTC has undergone numerous extensions and received varying levels of legislative support, contributing to volatility in the demand for new wind energy installations. In 2015, the PTC was extended for a multi-year term, with a time-based phase out of the amount of credit, dropping from 100% to 40% for new wind projects commencing construction before the end of 2016 through 2019. In 2019, the PTC was extended for an additional year, allowing for a 60% credit for projects commenced before the end of 2020. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, enacted in December 2020, provides an additional one-year extension of the 60% credit, and also establishes a new 30% investment tax credit for off-shore wind projects. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service generally allows four years from start of construction of a wind project to its in-service date to be eligible for the credit. As a result, under the most recent extension, the PTC supports new on-shore wind projects commencing as late as 2021 and completed by 2025. Generally, orders for wind towers supporting new projects are placed approximately six to nine months ahead of project completion. Together with the increased cost competitiveness of wind energy, state renewable fuel mandates, and increasing business acceptance of long-term decarbonization goals, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these wind energy incentives.
We also manufacture steel traffic structures for use on the U.S. highway and road system. We have two manufacturing plants serving the Florida market. Our products include overhead steel sign structures, tolling gantry structures, mast and sign arms, and other custom solutions. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from healthy public infrastructure spending in Florida and adjacent states, and we have opportunities to grow organically into new geographies, as well. 
Our telecom structures business sells to wireless communication carriers and third-party tower lessors and developers. We have one manufacturing plant in Oklahoma and also have the capability to manufacture telecom structures in our other Engineered Structures plants. Our products include self-supporting lattice towers, monopole towers, and guyed towers. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from continued spending on the buildout of 5G and other wireless networks in North America.
Our storage tanks support oil, gas, and chemical markets and are used by industrial plants, utilities, residences, and small businesses in suburban and rural areas. We are one of the primary manufacturers in North America of pressurized and non-pressurized tanks that store and transport a wide variety of products, including propane, anhydrous ammonia, and natural gas liquids. We also manufacture fertilizer storage containers for agricultural markets, including bulk storage, farm storage, and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal material used in our Engineered Structures segment is steel. During 2020, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and ended 2020 significantly higher than 2019. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profit for the year. Arcosa’s manufacturing operations also use component parts, such as flanges for wind towers. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industries to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships with multiple suppliers will meet our current production forecasts.
Transportation Products.
Markets
Our Transportation Products segment consists of established companies that supply manufactured steel products to the transportation industry. These transportation products serve a wide variety of markets, including the transportation of commodities such as grain, coal, aggregates, chemicals, fertilizers, petrochemicals, and refined products. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on demand for liquid tank barges, as the movements of crude oil, refined products, and petrochemicals along the inland waterways have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Replacement of the aging dry barge fleet remains a demand driver for hopper barges; however, the recent steep increase in steel prices has weakened demand. Our businesses providing steel components to the North American rail industry currently face challenging market conditions as the forecast for new railcar production is expected to decline in 2021.
Products, Customers, and Competitors
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Transportation Products segment manufactures and sells inland barges, fiberglass barge covers, winches, and marine hardware; and steel components for railcars and other transportation and industrial equipment. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to inland barges and steel components products.
We have a leading position in the U.S. market for the manufacture of inland barges and fiberglass barge covers. We manufacture a variety of hopper barges, tank barges, and fiberglass covers, and we provide a full line of deck hardware to the marine industry, including hatches, castings, and winches for towboats and dock facilities. Dry cargo barges transport various commodities, such as grain, coal, and aggregates. Tank barges transport liquids including refined products, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges. Our barge manufacturing facilities are located along the U.S. inland river systems, allowing for rapid delivery to our customers. Our customers are primarily commercial marine transportation companies, lessors, and industrial shippers. We compete with a number of other manufacturers in the U.S.
We are a recognized manufacturer of steel components for railcars and other transportation equipment. We manufacture axles, circular forgings, and coupling devices for freight, tank, locomotive, and passenger rail transportation equipment, as well as other industrial uses, and also provide cast components for use in the industrial and mining sectors. Our customers are primarily freight and passenger railcar manufacturers, rail maintenance and repair facilities, railroads, steel mills, and mining equipment manufacturers. We compete with both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal material used in our Transportation Products segment is steel. During 2020, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and ended 2020 significantly higher than 2019. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profit for the year. Arcosa’s manufacturing operations also use component parts, such as pumps, engines, and hardware for tank barges. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industries to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships with multiple suppliers will meet our current production forecasts.

Employee Health and Safety.
Arcosa is committed to safety across our operations. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our employees. We strive to continuously improve our procedures, processes, and management systems with regard to employee health and safety. These efforts are achieved by promoting safe work practices among employees and contractors and maintaining property and equipment in safe operating conditions. In furtherance of Arcosa’s commitment to improving our safety performance, the Company achieved improvements in certain safety metrics during 2020.
 In 2019, we launched a reenergized safety initiative named ARC 100 with a goal to achieve positive measurable change in our safety culture by empowering employees to take active ownership. Arcosa is partnering with a leading safety culture consultant to continue building a strong safety culture throughout our businesses with the ARC 100 program. 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of focusing on the health and safety of our employees. As an essential business, we have followed the federal, state, and local guidelines governing our facilities and shared best practices across the organization. We implemented safeguard measures including, but not limited to: social distancing processes in all facilities; measures to temperature check and health screen employees daily; increased frequency of deep cleaning workspaces and common areas; reinforced hand washing and infection control training; processes to track and manage employees who report or have COVID-19 symptoms or exposure; actions to screen, limit, or prohibit visitors to all facilities; and elimination of non-essential travel. Additionally, plant management were able to mobilize an operational response to COVID-19 through important tools created by a collaborative best practices team. Arcosa has continued to monitor and implement updates of CDC guidelines and best practices for COVID-19 mitigation procedures.
Diversity and Inclusion.
Arcosa values diversity and inclusion within its workforce and is committed to a work environment which promotes professionalism and inclusiveness. One of Arcosa’s core values is “We Win Together”. This core belief drives our commitment to a workplace free from discrimination; where collaboration, dedication, and unity align to drive favorable results for all stakeholders. We are making strides to advance diversity in our workforce and leadership team.
Talent Attraction and Management.
Arcosa believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. As part of the Company’s effort to attract and motivate employees, Arcosa offers competitive compensation and benefits, including healthcare and retirement benefits, parental and family leave, and holiday and paid time off. During 2020, the Company made several enhancements to its benefit plans. Most notably, the Company simplified and increased the matching program for its 401(K) plan. As a result, our employee participation has increased to 95%.
Arcosa fosters employee development through a variety of leadership and training programs, tuition reimbursement at education institutions, professional society memberships, and relevant conference and symposia attendance. 
Seasonality. Results in our Construction Products segment are affected by seasonal fluctuations with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.
Intellectual Property. Arcosa owns a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although Arcosa’s intellectual property rights are important to Arcosa’s success, we do not regard our business as being dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business and Operations.”
Governmental Regulation.
Construction Products. Arcosa’s Construction Products segment is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), the Health-Safety and Reclamation Code of Ministry of Mines for British Columbia, and various state agencies, and certain specialty materials are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
Engineered Structures. Arcosa’s storage tanks are subject to the regulations by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and the U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), both of which are part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”), and various state agencies. These agencies promulgate and enforce rules and regulations pertaining, in part, to the manufacture of tanks that are used in the storage, transportation and transport arrangement, and distribution of regulated and non-regulated substances.
Transportation Products. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Customs Service, the Maritime Administration of the USDOT, and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. These organizations establish safety criteria, investigate vessel accidents, and recommend improved safety standards. 
Our steel components businesses that serve the railcar industry are regulated by governmental agencies such as the USDOT and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration, and industry authorities such as the Association of American Railroads. All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications, and operating standards affecting rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. In addition to the regulations described above, our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and, within our Construction Products segment, MSHA. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims that may be asserted against Arcosa for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
International Regulations. We ship raw materials to Mexico and manufacture products in Mexico that are sold in the U.S. or elsewhere, which are subject to customs and other regulations. In addition, we are subject to other governmental regulations and authorities in Mexico and other countries where we conduct business that regulate products manufactured, sold, or used in those countries. 
Environmental, Health, and Safety. We are subject to federal, state, and international environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S., Mexico, and each country in which we operate, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials, and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing, or nearby activities.
We cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding reserves for environmental matters.
See Item 1A for further discussion of risk factors with regard to environmental, governmental, and other matters.
