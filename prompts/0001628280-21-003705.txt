ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
General
JetBlue Airways Corporation, or JetBlue, is New York's Hometown Airline®. As of December 31, 2020, JetBlue served 98 destinations in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America.
JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 and commenced service on February 11, 2000. We believe our differentiated product and culture combined with our competitive cost structure enables us to compete effectively in the high-value geographies we serve. Looking to the future, we plan to continue to grow in our high-value geographies, invest in industry leading products and provide award-winning service by our 20,000 dedicated employees, whom we refer to as crewmembers. Going forward, we believe we will continue to differentiate ourselves from other airlines, enabling us to continue to attract a greater mix of customers, and to drive further profitable growth. We are focused on delivering solid results for our shareholders, our customers, and our crewmembers. 
 As used in this Report, the terms “JetBlue,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to JetBlue Airways Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal executive offices are located at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, Long Island City, New York 11101 and our telephone number is (718) 286-7900. 
Our Industry and Competition
The U.S. airline industry is extremely competitive and challenging, and results are often volatile. It is uniquely susceptible to external factors such as fuel costs, downturns in domestic and international economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and associated stay at home orders and travel restrictions, the impact of airline restructurings or consolidations, and military actions or acts of terrorism. We operate in a capital and energy intensive industry that has high fixed costs, as well as heavy taxation and fees. Airline returns are sensitive to slight changes in fuel prices, average fare levels, and passenger demand. The industry's principal competitive factors include fares, brand and customer service, route networks, flight schedules, aircraft types, safety records, codeshare and interline relationships, inflight entertainment and connectivity systems, and frequent flyer programs. 
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
The unprecedented coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic and the related travel restrictions and physical distancing measures implemented throughout the world have significantly reduced demand for air travel. Beginning in March 2020, large public events were canceled, governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on non-essential activities, businesses suspended travel, and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors. Certain countries have imposed bans on international travelers for specified periods or indefinitely.
Demand for air travel began to weaken at the end of February 2020. The pace of decline accelerated throughout March into April 2020 and demand remained depressed throughout the rest of 2020. This decline in demand has had a material adverse impact on our operating revenues and financial position. Our capacity and operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 declined by 48.8% and 63.5% year-over-year, respectively. Although demand began to improve as the year progressed, it remained significantly lower than in prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery is uncertain given the significant impact of the pandemic on the overall U.S. and global economy.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 2020 we have implemented a number of measures to focus on the safety of our customers, our crewmembers, and our business. We expect the demand environment to remain depressed until the majority of the U.S. population is vaccinated against COVID-19. Our response to the pandemic and the measures we take to secure additional liquidity may be modified as we have more clarity on the timing of demand recovery.
JETBLUE EXPERIENCE
 We offer our customers a distinctive flying experience which we refer to as the "JetBlue Experience''. We believe we deliver award-winning service that focuses on the entire customer experience, from booking an itinerary to arrival at the final destination. Typically, our customers are neither high-traffic business travelers nor ultra-price sensitive travelers. Rather, we believe we are the carrier of choice for the majority of travelers who have been underserved by other airlines as we offer a differentiated product and award winning customer service. 
Differentiated Product and Culture
Delivering the JetBlue Experience to our customers through our differentiated product and culture is core to our mission to inspire humanity. We look to attract new customers to our brand and provide current customers with a reason to come back by continuing to innovate and evolve the JetBlue Experience. We believe we can adapt to the changing needs of our customers and a key element of our success is the belief that competitive fares and quality air travel need not be mutually exclusive. 
Our award winning service begins from the moment our customers purchase a ticket through one of our distribution channels such as www.jetblue.com, our mobile applications, or our reservations centers. Customers can purchase one of four branded fares: Blue Basic, Blue, Blue Extra, and in select markets, Blue Plus. Each fare includes different offerings such as priority boarding, advance seat selections, free checked bags, reduced change fees, and additional TrueBlue® points, with all fares including our core offering of free inflight entertainment, free brand name snacks, and free non-alcoholic beverages. Customers can choose to “buy up” to an option with additional offerings. These different fares allow customers to select the products or services they need or value when they travel, without having to pay for the things they do not need or value. 
Upon arrival at the airport, our customers are welcomed by our dedicated crewmembers and can choose to purchase one or more of our ancillary options such as Even More® Speed, allowing them to enjoy an expedited security experience in most domestic JetBlue locations. Customers who select our Blue Extra option or purchase a Mint® seat receive Even More® Speed as part of their fare. We additionally have mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices which have robust features including real-time flight information updates and mobile check-in for certain routes. Our applications are designed to enhance our customers' travel experience and are in keeping with the JetBlue Experience. 
Our self-service layout in select BlueCities redesigned the way our customers travel through the airport lobby. Our user-friendly kiosks are the first point of contact for each customer traveling through the airport lobby and allow for contact-less service. While all customers are encouraged to use the kiosks, our lobby layout allows them to choose the check-in experience they prefer. Customers who choose to use our kiosk receive a virtually queue-less experience. For customers who prefer a more traditional experience, our Help Desk offers full-service check-in. The self-service model allows crewmembers to get out from behind the ticket counter and move through the lobby to guide our customers through the check-in process. The self-service lobby opens up the opportunity for our crewmembers to make personal connections with our customers, to assist with bag tagging, to answer customer questions and to direct them to their next step in the travel experience.
Once onboard our aircraft, customers enjoy seats in a comfortable layout with the most legroom in the main cabin of all U.S. airlines, based on average fleet-wide seat pitch. Our Even More® Space seats are available for purchase across our fleet, giving customers the opportunity to enjoy additional legroom. Customers on certain transcontinental or Caribbean flights have the option to purchase our premium service, Mint®, which has 16 fully lie-flat seats, including four suites with privacy doors.
In February 2021, we unveiled a reimagined version of our Mint® experience. The new service includes a completely refreshed cabin design featuring private suites with a sliding door for every Mint® customer. Each Mint® aircraft will also include two Mint® Studio suites which offers the most space in a premium experience from any U.S. airline based on personal square footage per passenger seat. We expect to debut this new premium service with a 16-seat individual suite layout on a limited number of flights between New York and Los Angeles in 2021. For our anticipated transatlantic flights to London, the new Mint® experience will include 24 individual suites. 
Our inflight entertainment system onboard the majority of our Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 aircraft includes 36 channels of free DIRECTV®, 100+ channels of free SiriusXM Radio® and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Customers on our Airbus A321 aircraft and certain restyled Airbus A320 aircraft have access to 100+ channels of DIRECTV®, 100+ channels of SiriusXM Radio® and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Our Mint® customers enjoy 15-inch flat screen televisions to experience our inflight entertainment offerings. Our entire fleet is equipped with Fly-Fi®, a broadband product that allows gate-to-gate Wi-Fi at every seat. Customers also have access to the Fly-Fi® Hub, a content portal where customers can access a wide range of movies, television shows, and additional content from their own personal devices. 
All customers may enjoy an assortment of free and unlimited brand name snacks and non-alcoholic beverages and have the option to purchase additional products such as blankets, pillows, headphones, premium beverages and premium food selections. Our Mint® customers have access to an assortment of complimentary food, beverages and products including a small-plates menu, artisanal snacks, alcoholic beverages, a blanket, pillows, and headphones. 
Our Airbus A321 aircraft in a single cabin layout have 200 seats and those with our Mint® offering have 159 seats. Our Airbus A320 aircraft in the classic configuration have 150 seats while our Embraer E190 aircraft have 100 seats. Those A320 aircraft which have gone through our cabin restyling program have 162 seats. We believe our multi-year restyling program will allow us to increase capacity in a capital-efficient and customer-focused way. Our first restyled Airbus A320 aircraft entered into revenue service in April 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had 72 restyled Airbus A320 aircraft in service. In December 2020, we took delivery of our first airbus A220 aircraft with a cabin configuration of 140 seats. 
 Because of our network strength in leisure destinations, we also sell vacation packages through our wholly owned subsidiary, JBTP, LLC, or JetBlue Travel Products, a one-stop, value-priced vacation service for self-directed packaged travel planning. These packages offer competitive fares for air travel on JetBlue along with a selection of JetBlue-recommended hotels and resorts, car rentals, and local attractions. 
We work to provide a superior air travel experience, including communicating openly and honestly with customers about delays and service disruptions. We have a Customer Bill of Rights which was introduced in 2007 to provide compensation to customers who experience inconveniences. This Customer Bill of Rights commits us to high service standards and holds us accountable if we fall short. 
Our customers have repeatedly indicated the distinctive JetBlue Experience is an important reason why they select us over other carriers. We measure and monitor customer feedback regularly which helps us to continuously improve customer satisfaction. One way we do so is by measuring our net promoter score, or NPS. This metric is used by companies in a broad range of industries to measure and monitor the customer experience. Many of the leading consumer brands that are recognized for great customer service receive high NPS scores. We believe a higher NPS score has positive effects on customer loyalty and ultimately leads to increased revenue.
Network
We are a predominately point-to-point system carrier, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities: New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Orlando, Los Angeles, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
Leisure traveler focused airlines are often faced with high seasonality. As a result, we continually work to manage our mix of customers to include both business travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives, or VFR. VFR travelers tend to be slightly less seasonal and less susceptible to economic downturns than traditional leisure destination travelers. Understanding the purpose of our customers' travel helps us optimize destinations, strengthen our network, and increase unit revenues. All six of our focus cities are in regions with a diverse mix of traffic. 
As of December 31, 2020, our network served 98 BlueCities in 30 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 23 countries in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
We group our capacity distribution based upon geographical regions rather than on a mileage or a length-of-haul basis. The historic distribution of ASMs, or capacity, by region for the years ending December 31 was:

Capacity Distribution | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Transcontinental | 31.7 | % | | 32.0 | % | 31.3 | %
Caribbean & Latin America (1) | 31.4 | | | 31.2 | | 28.7 | 
Florida | 27.4 | | | 25.2 | | 27.3 | 
East | 4.5 | | | 6.0 | | 6.5 | 
Central | 4.0 | | | 4.0 | | 4.0 | 
West | 1.0 | | | 1.6 | | 2.2 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1) Domestic operations as defined by the U.S. Department of Transport, or DOT, include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but for the purposes of the capacity distribution table above, we have included these locations in the Caribbean and Latin America region.
We made numerous adjustments to our network in response to the dynamic environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, we significantly reduced our capacity to a level that maintained essential services to align with the precipitous decline in demand. We temporarily consolidated our operations in certain cities that contain multiple airport locations and parked a portion of our fleet.
As the pandemic progressed, we launched new routes to serve customers in markets where leisure and VFR travel showed signs of recovery. These new routes offered us the opportunity to generate revenue, bring aircraft back into service, and added more flying opportunities for our crewmembers and customers.
We expect to resume our plans to increase our presence in our focus cities and diversify our network as we recover from the pandemic. We have previously announced service to the following new destinations:

Destination | Service Expected to Commence
Key West, Florida | February 11, 2021 
Miami, Florida | February 11, 2021 
Guatemala City, Guatemala(*) | April 15, 2021 
Los Cabos, Mexico(*) | June 17, 2021 

(*) Subject to receipt of government operating authority.
We also anticipate launching service from Boston and JFK to London in 2021. London will be our first BlueCity in Europe.
Airline Commercial Partnerships
Airlines frequently participate in commercial partnerships with other carriers in order to increase customer convenience by providing interline-connectivity, codeshare, complementary flight schedules, frequent flyer program reciprocity, and other joint marketing activities. As of December 31, 2020, we had 48 airline commercial partnerships. Our commercial partnerships typically begin as an interline agreement allowing a customer to book a single itinerary with tickets on multiple airlines. On their day of travel, they enjoy a simplified airport experience with single check-in and bag drop. 
In July 2020, we announced our intention to enter into a strategic relationship with American Airlines Group Inc. ("American"). This arrangement, once fully implemented, will include an alliance agreement with reciprocal code sharing on domestic and international routes from or connecting through New York (John F. Kennedy International Airport ("JFK"), LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport) and Boston, excluding JetBlue's future European transatlantic flying. We believe this partnership will create more capacity, seamless connectivity for travelers in the northeast, and offer more choices for customers across the networks of both airlines. In addition, we believe this relationship will also accelerate our recovery as the travel industry adapts to new trends as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to federal law, American and JetBlue submitted this proposed alliance arrangement to the Department of Transportation ("DOT") for review. After American, JetBlue and the DOT agreed to a series of commitments, the DOT terminated its review of the proposed alliance. The commitments include growth commitments to ensure capacity expansion, slot divestitures at JFK and at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. and antitrust compliance measures. Beyond this agreement with the DOT, American and JetBlue will also be limiting their coordination on certain city pair markets within the scope of the alliance. In addition to the DOT review, the Department of Justice and the New York Attorney General, the Massachusetts Attorney General, and the Attorneys General of certain other state and local jurisdictions are investigating this proposed alliance, which are ongoing. American and JetBlue intend to cooperate with those investigations, but are proceeding with plans to implement this alliance.
 In 2021, we expect to continue to seek additional strategic opportunities through new commercial partners as well as assess ways to deepen existing airline partnerships. We plan to do this by expanding codeshare relationships and other areas of cooperation such as frequent flyer programs. We believe these commercial partnerships allow us to better leverage our strong network and drive incremental traffic and revenue while improving off-peak travel.
Marketing 
JetBlue is a widely recognized and respected global brand. JetBlue created a new category in air travel and our brand stands for high service quality at a reasonable cost. We believe this brand has evolved into an important and valuable asset which identifies us as a safe, reliable, high value airline. Similarly, we believe customer awareness of our brand has contributed to the success of our marketing efforts. It enables us to promote ourselves as a preferred marketing partner with companies across many different industries. 
We market our services through advertising and promotions in various media forms including popular social media outlets. We engage in large multi-market programs, local events and sponsorships across our route network as well as mobile marketing programs. Our targeted public and community relations efforts reflect our commitment to the communities we serve, promote brand awareness, and complement our strong reputation. 
Distribution
Our primary and preferred distribution channel to customers is through our website, www.jetblue.com, our lowest cost channel. Our website allows us to more closely control and deliver the JetBlue Experience while also offering the full suite of JetBlue Fare Options, Even More® Space and Speed, and other ancillary services. 
Our participation in global distribution systems, or GDS, supports our profitable growth, particularly in the business market. We find business customers are more likely to book through a travel agency or a booking product which relies on a GDS platform. Although the cost of sales through this channel is higher than through our website, the average fare purchased through a GDS is generally higher and often covers the increased distribution costs. We currently participate in several major 
GDS and online travel agents, or OTA. Due to the majority of our customers booking travel on our website, we maintain relatively low distribution costs despite our increased participation in GDS and OTA in recent years.
Customer Loyalty Program
TrueBlue® is our customer loyalty program designed to reward and recognize loyal customers. Members earn points based upon, among other methods, the amount paid for JetBlue flights and services from certain commercial partners. Our points do not expire, the program has no black-out dates, points can be redeemed for any open seat, and any JetBlue destination can be booked if the TrueBlue® member has enough points to exchange for the value of an open seat. Mosaic® is an additional level for our most loyal customers who (1) fly a minimum of 30 times with JetBlue and acquire at least 12,000 base flight points within a calendar year, (2) accumulate 15,000 base flight points within a calendar year, or (3) in certain circumstances, qualify through a minimum credit card spend of $50,000 in a calendar year.
We made several updates to our TrueBlue® program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include extending the status of all current Mosaic® customers through 2021 and also reducing the qualification requirements for customers trying to earn Mosaic® status by 50% in 2021. Under the updated program, customers can now enjoy Mosaic® benefits by either (1) flying a minimum of 15 times with JetBlue and acquiring at least 6,000 base flight points within a calendar year or (2) accumulating 7,500 base flight points within a calendar year. These reduced qualification requirements are effective through the end of 2021.
We currently have co-branded loyalty credit cards available to eligible U.S. residents, as well as co-brand agreements in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to allow cardholders to earn TrueBlue® points. Our co-branded credit cards in the United States are issued in partnership with Barclaycard® on the MasterCard® network. We also have co-branded loyalty credit cards issued by Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and MasterCard® in Puerto Rico as well as Banco Popular Dominicano and MasterCard® in the Dominican Republic. These credit cards allow customers in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to take full advantage of our TrueBlue® loyalty program. 
We have various agreements with other loyalty partners, including financial institutions, hotels, and car rental companies, that allow their customers to earn TrueBlue® points through participation in our partners’ programs. We intend to continue to develop the footprint of our co-branded credit cards and pursue other loyalty partnerships in the future.
OPERATIONS AND COST STRUCTURE
Historically, our cost structure has allowed us to price fares lower than many of our competitors and was a principal reason for our profitable growth prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Our cost advantage relative to some of our competitors was due to, among other factors, high aircraft utilization, new and efficient aircraft, relatively low distribution costs, and a productive workforce. Because our network initiatives and growth plans require a low cost platform, we strive to stay focused on our competitive costs, operational excellence, efficiency improvements, and enhancing critical elements of the JetBlue Experience. We will remain nimble and continue to execute on our cost plan in the face of changing customer behaviors as we navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Route Structure
JetBlue's point-to-point system is the foundation of our operational structure, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities. This structure allows us to optimize costs as well as accommodate customers' preference for nonstop itineraries. A vast majority of our operations are centered in the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. This airspace is some of the world's most congested and drives certain operational constraints.
Our peak levels of traffic over the course of the typical year vary by route; the East Coast to Florida/Caribbean routes peak from October through April and the West Coast routes peak in the summer months. Generally speaking, many of our areas of operations in the Northeast experience poor winter weather conditions, resulting in increased costs associated with de-icing aircraft, canceled flights, and accommodating displaced customers. Many of our Florida and Caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes. As we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses by other airlines. 
Our flying in 2020 did not follow the typical historical patterns and was instead shaped by our responses to the significant declines in demand for air travel and changes in travel behavior triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated government travel restrictions in the U.S. and international destinations we serve. 
•New York metropolitan area - We are New York's Hometown Airline®. Approximately one-half of our flights originate from or are destined for the New York metropolitan area. JFK is New York's largest airport, and we are the second largest airline at JFK as measured by domestic seats. Our 2020 operations accounted for 39% of seats offered on domestic routes from JFK. We also serve New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, or Newark, New York 
City's LaGuardia Airport, or LaGuardia, New York's Stewart International Airport, or Newburgh, and New York's Westchester County Airport, or White Plains.
•Boston - We are the largest carrier at Boston's Logan International Airport, or Boston. At the end of 2020, we flew to 70 nonstop destinations from Boston and our operations accounted for 31% of all seats offered in Boston. 
•Caribbean and Latin America - At the end of 2020, we had 35 BlueCities in the Caribbean and Latin America. San Juan, Puerto Rico is our only focus city outside of the Continental U.S. We are a leading carrier in Puerto Rico serving three airports. We are also the largest airline in the Dominican Republic, serving four airports. 
•Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood - We are a leading carrier at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, or Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, with approximately 19% of all seats offered in 2020. 
•Orlando - We are the leading carrier measured by seats at Orlando International Airport, or Orlando. At the end of 2020, we served 33 nonstop destinations from Orlando and our operations accounted for 10% of all seats offered in Orlando in 2020. 
•Los Angeles area - We are the sixth largest carrier in the Los Angeles area measured by seats, operating from Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, Burbank's Bob Hope Airport, or Burbank, and Ontario International Airport, or Ontario. In July 2020, we announced our plans to make LAX a focus city and our primary base of operations on the west coast. To enable this shift, we relocated our operations from Long Beach Airport along with our crew and maintenance bases in October 2020. We believe this move will enable us to embark on a strategic expansion over the next five years with plans to reach approximately 70 flights per day by 2025.
Fleet Structure
We currently operate Airbus A321, Airbus A320, and Embraer E190 aircraft types. As of December 31, 2020, our fleet had an average age of 11.3 years. We took delivery of our first Airbus A220 aircraft in December 2020. We expect this aircraft to enter into service in early 2021.
The reliability of our fleet is essential to ensuring our operations run efficiently and we are continually working with our aircraft and engine manufacturers to enhance our performance.
We continue to work with the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, in efforts towards implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen. NextGen technology is expected to improve operational efficiency in the congested airspaces in which we operate. NextGen is a multi-year modernization project with a target of having all major components in place by 2025. As part of NextGen, our aircraft will be outfitted with the following: 
•Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out ("ADSB-Out"): ADSB-Out is a global positioning system ("GPS") surveillance technology that give air traffic controllers the precise location of aircraft every second. The goal of this technology is to safely boost the capacity of our airspace. 
•Satellite-based Communications: We are putting satellite-based voice and data communications ("SATCOM") on our Airbus fleet. As planned, every aircraft will be assigned a unique phone number, similar to a cell network, aimed at giving us positive contact with our aircraft anywhere in the world.
•Data Comm: Data Comm makes departures more efficient by dramatically speeding up the process of aircraft pilots obtaining clearance from air traffic controllers. With Data Comm, controllers can simply push clearance details to the aircraft and dispatcher, which the pilot can confirm and automatically input into the flight computer with the push of a button. 
Fleet Maintenance
Consistent with our core value of safety, our FAA-approved maintenance programs are administered by our technical operations department. We use qualified maintenance personnel and ensure they have comprehensive training. We maintain our aircraft and associated maintenance records in accordance with, if not exceeding, FAA regulations. As a result of the significant reduction in demand expectations and lower capacity driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily parked a portion of our fleet throughout 2020 and continuing into 2021. Fleet maintenance work is divided into three categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component maintenance.
The bulk of our line maintenance is handled by JetBlue technicians and inspectors. It consists of daily checks, overnight and weekly checks, or "A" checks, diagnostics, and routine repairs. 
Heavy maintenance checks, or "C" checks, consist of a series of more complex tasks taking from one to four weeks to complete and are typically performed once every 15 months. All of our aircraft heavy maintenance work is performed by third party FAA-approved facilities such as Aeroman (an MRO Holdings company), Flightstar (an MRO Holdings company), and PEMCO World Air Services (an Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc. company), and are subject to direct 
oversight by JetBlue personnel. We outsource heavy maintenance as the costs are lower than if we performed the tasks internally. 
Component maintenance on equipment such as engines, auxiliary power units, landing gears, pumps, and avionic computers are all performed by a number of different FAA-approved third party repair stations. We have time and materials agreements with MTU Aero Engines, Lufthansa Technik AG, and International Aero Engines AG ("IAE") for the repair, overhaul, modification, and logistics of our Airbus aircraft engines. We also have a maintenance agreement with GE Engine Services, LLC for our Embraer E190 aircraft engines and IAE for our Airbus A321neo aircraft engines. Many of our maintenance service agreements are based on a fixed cost per flight hour. These fixed costs vary based upon the age of the aircraft and other operating factors impacting the related component. Required maintenance not otherwise covered by these agreements is performed on a time and materials basis. All other maintenance activities are sub-contracted to qualified maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities. 
Aircraft Fuel
Aircraft fuel continues to be one of our largest expenses. Its price has been extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors which we can neither control nor accurately predict. Our 2020 fuel consumption decreased by 53.4% compared to 2019 due to capacity reductions in response to lower demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a third party to assist with fuel management service and to procure most of our fuel. Our historical fuel consumption and costs for the years ended December 31 were:

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Gallons consumed (millions) | 412 | | | 885 | | | 849 | 
Total cost (millions)(1) | $ | 631 | | | $ | 1,847 | | | $ | 1,899
Average price per gallon(1) | $ | 1.53 | | | $ | 2.09 | | | $ | 2.24 
Percent of operating expenses | 13.5 | % | | 25.3 | % | | 25.7 | %

(1) Total cost and average price per gallon each include related fuel taxes as well as effective fuel hedging gains and losses.
We attempt to protect ourselves against the volatility of fuel prices by entering into a variety of derivative instruments. These include call spread options, call options, swaps, caps, collars, and basis swaps with underlyings of jet fuel, crude and heating oil.
Financial Health
We strive to maintain financial strength and a cost structure that enables us to grow profitably and sustainably. In the first years of our history, we relied on financing activities to fund much of our growth. Starting in 2007, our growth has largely been funded through internally generated cash from operations.
In response to the travel restrictions, decreased demand, and other effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the Company's business, we have secured over $4 billion in net proceeds through various debt and equity financing activities in 2020. We believe the additional liquidity will allow us to navigate through the pandemic in the short-term. We will continue to evaluate future financing opportunities to build additional levels of liquidity as needed. Due to the impact that the demand environment has had on our financial condition, our credit ratings were downgraded during 2020. Our current ratings from the three major credit rating agencies are summarized below: 

Rating Agency | Current Rating | Outlook 
Fitch | BB- | Negative
Moody's | Ba2 | Negative
Standard & poor's | B+ | Negative

With its Inspiration Center headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, we believe JetBlue Travel Products will play an important role in delivering our vision of inspiring humanity, extending our reach further across the travel ribbon to offer customers an even more seamless travel experience. 
TWA Flight Center Hotel 
In 2015, the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, or the PANYNJ approved a construction plan to redevelop the TWA Flight Center at JFK on its nearly six-acre site into a hotel with over 500 rooms, meeting spaces, restaurants, a spa and an observation deck. As part of the plan, a 75-year lease agreement was entered into between the PANYNJ and the Flight Center Hotel, LLC, a partnership of MCR Development, LLC and JetBlue. The TWA Flight Center Hotel opened for business in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we have an approximate 10% ownership interest in the hotel.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Our People and Culture
We believe our success depends on our crewmembers delivering the JetBlue Experience in the sky and on the ground. One of our competitive strengths is a service oriented culture grounded in our five key values: safety, caring, integrity, passion, and fun. We believe a highly productive and engaged workforce enhances customer loyalty. Our goal is to hire, train, and retain a diverse workforce of caring, passionate, fun, and friendly people who share our mission to inspire humanity.
We first introduce our culture to new crewmembers during the screening process and then at an extensive new hire orientation program at JetBlue University, our training center in Orlando. Orientation focuses on the JetBlue strategy and emphasizes the importance of customer service, productivity, and cost control. We provide continuous training for our crewmembers including technical training, various leadership training programs, and regular training focused on the safety value and front line training for our customer service teams. 
Our historical and, post-pandemic, future growth plans necessitate and facilitate opportunities for talent development. In 2016, we launched Gateway Select, a program for prospective pilots to join us for a rigorous, approximately four-year training program in partnership with CAE Inc. that incorporates classroom learning, extensive real-world flying experience and instruction in full flight simulators.
We believe a direct relationship between crewmembers and our leadership is in the best interests of our crewmembers, our customers, and our shareholders. Except for our pilots and inflight crewmembers, our crewmembers do not have third-party representation. In 2014, JetBlue’s pilots voted for, and the National Mediation Board, or NMB, certified the Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA, as the representative body for JetBlue pilots after winning a representation election. We reached a final agreement for our first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by the pilots in 2018. The agreement is a four-year renewable contract effective August 1, 2018. In April 2018, JetBlue inflight crewmembers elected to be solely represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU. The NMB certified the TWU as the representative body for JetBlue inflight crewmembers. In November 2020, our inflight crewmembers voted to decline the ratification of a tentative collective bargaining agreement between JetBlue and TWU. We are currently working with TWU to determine next steps. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 51 percent of our full-time equivalent crewmembers were represented by unions. The following table sets forth our crewmember groups and the status of their respective collective bargaining agreements. 
Crewmember Group | Representative | Crewmembers(1) | Amendable Date(2)
Pilots | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 3,715 | August 1, 2022 
Inflight | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 3,572 | In negotiations 

(1) Approximate number of active full-time equivalent crewmembers as of December 31, 2020.
(2) Our relations with our labor organizations are governed by Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, pursuant to which the collective bargaining agreements between us and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a certain date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
We have individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA licensed crewmembers which consist of dispatchers, technicians, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and renews for an additional five-year term, unless the crewmember is terminated for cause or the crewmember elects not to renew. Pursuant to these employment agreements, crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business, resulting in a reduction of flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. We provide what we believe to be industry-leading job protection through these agreements. We believe these agreements provide JetBlue and crewmembers flexibility and allow us to react to crewmember needs more efficiently than collective bargaining agreements.
A key feature of the direct relationship with our crewmembers is our Values Committees which are made up of peer-elected frontline crewmembers from each of our major work groups, other than pilots and inflight crewmembers. They represent the interests of our workgroups and help us run our business in a productive and efficient manner. We believe this direct relationship with crewmembers drives higher levels of engagement and alignment with JetBlue’s strategy, culture, and overall goals.
We believe the efficiency and engagement of our crewmembers is a result of our flexible and productive work rules. We are cognizant of the competition for productive labor in key industry positions and new government rules requiring higher qualifications as well as more restricted hours that may result in potential labor shortages in the upcoming years. 
Our leadership team communicates on a regular basis with all crewmembers in order to maintain a direct relationship and to keep them informed about news, strategy updates, and challenges affecting the airline and the industry. Effective and frequent communication throughout the organization is fostered through various means including email messages from our CEO and other senior leaders at least weekly, weekday news updates to all crewmembers, crewmember engagement surveys, and active leadership participation in new hire orientations. Leadership is also heavily involved in periodic open forum meetings across our network, called “pocket sessions” which are often videotaped and posted on our intranet. By soliciting feedback for ways to improve our service, teamwork and work environment, our leadership team works to keep crewmembers engaged and makes our business decisions transparent. Additionally, we believe cost and revenue improvements are best recognized by crewmembers on the job.
Our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of 3,714 pilots, 4,308 inflight (whom other airlines may refer to as flight attendants), 2,745 airport operations personnel, 653 technicians (whom other airlines may refer to as mechanics), 849 reservation agents, and 3,181 management and other personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we employed an average of 16,228 full-time and 4,514 part-time crewmembers.
Our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers decreased by 16.6% compared to 2019 as a result of various voluntary separation and time off programs implemented in response to the drastic decline in demand for air travel brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Every day we aim to live our mission of inspiring humanity, driving inclusion both inside and outside the Company. While we recognize that there is a lack of diversity in certain areas of the commercial aviation industry, we are taking steps to address that challenge.
Our efforts to promote diversity and inclusion are centered around three key pillars: (1) representative leadership; (2) an open culture; and (3) commercial impact. This focus starts at the top.
As leadership opportunities emerge, we will continue to seek qualified diverse candidates to propel our Company forward. To this end, we have expanded our recruitment streams for diverse talent through partnerships with the National Gay Pilots Association, Boston Pride, and the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals, among others. In 2018, we appointed our first female President and Chief Operating Officer, Joanna Geraghty. Today, women account for more than one-third of our Board of Directors and approximately one-fifth of our senior leadership team.
All JetBlue crewmembers have the right to an open and respectful workplace. Our Code of Conduct prohibits all forms of discrimination, and we promote open communication to resolve any discrimination concerns. Every JetBlue director-level crewmember and above is required to participate in unconscious bias training.
Crewmember Programs
We are committed to supporting our crewmembers through a number of programs including: 
•Crewmember Resource Groups (CRGs) - We encourage crewmembers to celebrate their individuality and build camaraderie through our various CRGs. CRGs spearhead programs to embrace and encourage the sharing of different perspectives, thoughts, and ideas. At the end of 2020, we had six CRGs which include:
◦Blue Aviasian: Celebrates the history of Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group offers immersive cultural experiences, networking, and career development events.
◦Blue Conexión: Shares the Latino culture and language in the workplace and community.
◦JADE (JetBlue African Diaspora Experience): Explores the rich cultures of the African diaspora. JADE leads cultural events during Black History Month and hosts TravelCon, a day-long event for crewmembers to learn about the diverse experience of Black travelers, among other events.
◦JetPride: Offers professional development opportunities for LGBTQ+ crewmembers and their allies. During Pride Month, crewmembers march across the network to celebrate diversity, equality and acceptance.
◦Vets in Blue: Provides a forum for crewmembers who honorably serve or have served in the Armed Forces. Vets in Blue strengthens JetBlue’s efforts to employ and retain members of the military through outreach, networking events, career fairs, and mentoring opportunities. Many former service members enjoy second careers with JetBlue in airport operations, corporate security, inflight, flight operations and more.
◦Women in Flight: Provides members with educational networking opportunities that inspire career and personal growth. Typically, the group hosts our annual Fly Like a Girl event, teaching young girls about different career paths in aviation. 
•JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund (JCCF) - This organization, originally formed in 2002, is a non-profit corporation independent from JetBlue and recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt entity. JCCF was created to assist JetBlue crewmembers and their immediate family members (IRS Dependents) with short-term financial support in times of crisis and unexpected emergencies when other resources are not available. Funds for JCCF grants come directly from crewmember donations via a tax-deductible payroll deduction. The assistance process is confidential with only the fund administrator and coordinator knowing the identity of the crewmembers in need.
•JetBlue Scholars - Developed in 2015, this program offers a new and innovative model to our crewmembers wishing to further their education. Crewmembers enrolled in the program can earn an undergraduate degree through self-directed online college courses facilitated by JetBlue. This reemphasizes our continuous effort to help provide assistance to our most valued asset, our people. To build on the program, we introduced the Master's Pathway program in 2019 which is designed to help crewmembers who would like to advance their education even further by pursuing a master's degree. The Master's Pathway program partners with reputable institutions to provide a variety of benefits to crewmembers including tuition discounts, scholarships, and access to specialized support services.
• Lift Recognition Program - Created in 2012, this crewmember recognition program encourages crewmembers to celebrate their peers for living JetBlue's values by sending e-thanks through an on-line platform. Our leadership team periodically hosts an event for the crewmembers who receive the highest number of Lift award recognitions in each quarter of the year. In 2020, we saw more than 100,000 Lift awards.
 Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to prioritize the safety of our crewmembers while continuing to support the needs of our operations during this period. Some of the steps we have taken include:    
•Introduced "Safety from the Ground Up", an initiative with a multi-layer approach that encompasses enhanced safety and cleaning measures on our flights, at our airports, and in our offices;
•Instituted temperature checks for all of our customer-facing and support-center crewmembers;
•Updated our sick leave policy to provide up to 14 days of paid sick leave for crewmembers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or were required to quarantine;
•Partnered with Northwell Direct to provide a comprehensive set of COVID-19 services and programs to support our crewmembers;
•Implemented a framework for internal contact tracing, crewmember notification, and a return to work clearance process for all crewmembers, wherever they may be located;
•Administered more frequent disinfecting of common surfaces and areas with high touchpoints in our facilities; and
•Conducted regular virtual "pocket sessions" to provide company-wide updates to our crewmembers as we navigate through the pandemic. 
Community Programs
JetBlue is committed to supporting the communities and BlueCities we serve through a variety of community programs including:
•Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - The CSR strategy, JetBlue For Good, focuses on three areas that our customers and crewmembers are passionate about: (1) youth and education, (2) community, and (3) environment. 
◦Youth and Education: As a pillar of JetBlue For Good, our youth and education efforts focus on providing children from underserved areas the resources needed to obtain a quality education and sustainable careers. We do this through various initiatives including donating age-appropriate books to areas where books are scarce outside of school walls. We also host regular career days that help expose young adults to the careers available to them upon graduation and beyond.
◦Community: We have a longstanding tradition of supporting the dedicated community organizations that make our BlueCities better. We show our support through partnerships, donations and more than the 1 million-plus volunteer hours logged by our crewmembers since 2011.
◦Environment: JetBlue’s primary environmental sustainability priority is reducing and managing carbon emissions from jet fuel. We are committed to investing in more fuel-efficient technologies, renewable fuels, electric ground service equipment, logistics and other measures to reduce our carbon footprint.
•JetBlue Foundation - Created in 2013 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, the JetBlue Foundation is a JetBlue-sponsored organization focused on raising awareness for careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and aviation. The JetBlue Foundation focuses on four main areas:
◦Partnering with organizations and communities to provide access to STEM programs for students from traditionally underserved communities;
◦Investing in programs geared toward students from diverse backgrounds to create a lifelong interest in STEM as early as possible in a student's academic career;
◦Creating equal opportunities and increasing access for all students to spark a passion for STEM; and
◦Building a more diverse talent pipeline for the aviation industry.

REGULATION
Airlines are heavily regulated, with rules and regulations set by various federal, state and local agencies. We also operate under specific regulations due to our operations within the high density airspace of the northeast U.S. Most of our airline operations are regulated by U.S. governmental agencies including:
DOT - The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service including, but not limited to, certification and fitness, insurance, consumer protection and competitive practices. They set the requirement that carriers cannot permit domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours. The DOT also requires that the advertised price for an airfare or a tour package including airfare (such as a hotel/air vacation package) has to be the total price to be paid by the customer, including all government taxes and fees. It has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions. 
FAA - The FAA primarily regulates flight operations, in particular, matters affecting air safety. This includes but is not limited to airworthiness requirements for aircraft, the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers, and the certification of flight attendants. It requires each airline to obtain an operating certificate authorizing the airline to operate at specific airports using specified equipment. Like all U.S. certified carriers, JetBlue cannot fly to new destinations without the prior authorization of the FAA. After providing notice and a hearing, the FAA has the authority to modify, suspend temporarily or revoke permanently our authority to provide air transportation or that of our licensed personnel for failure to comply with FAA regulations. It can additionally assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations. When significant safety issues are involved, it can revoke a U.S. carrier's authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing. It monitors our compliance with maintenance as well as flight operations and safety regulations. It maintains on-site representatives and performs frequent spot inspections of our aircraft, crewmembers and records. The FAA also has the authority to issue airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders. This includes the inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, collision and wind shear avoidance systems, noise abatement, and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. We have and maintain FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft and have the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the destinations we currently serve. 
Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection - The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, and the U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection, or CBP, operate under the Department of Homeland Security and are responsible for all civil aviation security. This includes passenger and baggage screening; cargo security measures; airport security; assessment and distribution of intelligence; security research and development; international passenger screening; customs; and agriculture. It also has law enforcement powers and the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of national emergency, without a notice or comment period. It can also assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain regulations. 
Taxes & Fees - The airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the U.S., with taxes and fees accounting for approximately 15% of the total fare charged to a customer. Airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer. The September 11 Security Fee which is set by the TSA and is passed through to the customer, is currently $5.60 per enplanement, regardless of the number of connecting flights and a round trip fee is limited to a maximum of $11.20. Effective December 28, 2015, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Aircraft Inspection fee increased from $70.75 to $225 per international aircraft arriving in the U.S.
State and Local - We are subject to state and local laws and regulations in a number of states in which we operate and the regulations of various local authorities operating the airports we serve.
Airport Access - JFK, LaGuardia, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, or Reagan National, are slot-controlled airports subject to the "High Density Rule" and successor rules issued by the FAA, or Slots. These rules were implemented due to the high volume of traffic at these popular airports located in the northeast corridor airspace. The rules limit the air traffic in and out of these airports during specific times; however, even with the rules in place, delays remain among the highest in the nation due to continuing airspace congestion. Additionally, we have Slots at other Slot-controlled airports governed by unique local ordinances not subject to the High Density Rule, such as Westchester County Airport in White Plains, NY. Gate access is another common issue at certain airports. 
Foreign Operations - International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The availability of international routes to U.S. airlines is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments. We currently operate international service to Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Saint Lucia, St. Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. We anticipate further expanding our network to Guatemala in 2021 and intend to begin service to London, our first destination in Europe. To the extent we seek to provide air transportation to additional international markets in the future, we would be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and the FAA as well as the applicable foreign government. During 2020, our flight operations to many of these countries were disrupted by travel restrictions that were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We believe we are operating in material compliance with DOT, FAA, TSA, CBP and applicable international regulations as well as hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations and certificates. Should any of these authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended, or revoked, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Other
Environmental - We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. This includes the regulation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals, as well as the regulation of aircraft noise administered by numerous state and federal agencies.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures as long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with the interstate and foreign commerce of the national air transportation system. Certain airports, including San Diego airport in California, have established restrictions to limit noise which can include limits on the number of hourly or daily operations and the time of such operations. These limitations are intended to protect the local noise-sensitive communities surrounding the airport. Our scheduled flights at San Diego airport are in compliance with the noise curfew limits, but on occasion when we experience irregular operations, we may violate these curfews. 
Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and ground operations emissions. In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program intended to promote carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. CORSIA is scheduled to be implemented through multiple phases beginning in 2021. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but we believe compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
As part of our sustainability and environmental strategy, we are embracing new technologies and making changes that will ultimately benefit our crewmembers, customers, and shareholders. Some of our sustainability initiatives include:
Reducing and Managing Carbon Dioxide ("CO2") Emissions - We are committed to reducing our contribution to global warming and climate change. We have been purchasing CO2 offsets since 2008. In 2020, we began offsetting our CO2 emissions from jet fuel for all domestic flights and became the first major U.S airline to achieve carbon neutrality on all domestic flying. Our target is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement. To reach net zero carbon emissions, we plan to continuously increase the fuel-efficiency of our operations, expand usage of sustainable aviation fuels, explore alternative power aircraft technology such as electric aircraft for short-hauls, and offset any remaining emissions.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel - As announced in January 2020, we have agreed to purchase sustainable aviation fuel produced from waste and residue raw materials. We began flying regularly with sustainable aviation fuel on flights from San Francisco International Airport in July 2020. We believe making the switch will help us significantly reduce CO2 emissions and our environmental footprint, with no impact on performance or safety. 
Operating a More Sustainable Fleet - We are working closely with the FAA towards implementing NextGen. NextGen will allow us to fly more efficient routes thereby reducing fuel burn and resulting emissions. Our Airbus A321neo aircraft will help reduce CO2 emissions with improved fuel economy through newly designed engine technology and cabin changes. In addition, our incoming Airbus A220 aircraft will reduce emissions by approximately 40% per seat compared to the older aircraft they will replace. 
Electric Ground Service Equipment - In 2019, we began replacing our gas-powered Ground Service Equipment ("GSE") at JFK with electric-powered versions, known as eGSE, to reduce fuel consumption, noise, and GHG emissions. We anticipate similar conversions to eGSE to be implemented at our other focus cities in the future. Our goal is to significantly expand our eGSE fleet by converting 40% of our three most commonly owned GSE vehicles (baggage tractors, belt loaders, and push back tugs) to electric by 2025 and 50% by 2030.
Reporting - We report annually on environmental, social, governance ("ESG") issues using the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures frameworks. The report can be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.jetblue.com.
Foreign Ownership - Under federal law and DOT regulations, JetBlue must be controlled by U.S. citizens. In this regard, our chief executive officer and at least two-thirds of our board of directors must be U.S. citizens. Further, no more than 24.99% of our outstanding common stock may be voted by non-U.S. citizens. We believe we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions.
Other Regulations - All airlines are subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 due to their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. They are also required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we take all necessary steps to comply with those requirements. 
Our labor relations are covered under Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and are subject to the jurisdiction of the NMB. 
In addition, during periods of fuel scarcity, access to aircraft fuel may be subject to federal allocation regulations. 
Civil Reserve Air Fleet - We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize our aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. By participating in this program, we are eligible to bid on and be awarded peacetime airlift contracts with the U.S. military.
Insurance
We carry various types of insurance customary in the airline industry and at amounts deemed adequate to protect us and our property as well as comply with both federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements.
