We were formed as a Delaware corporation on January 31, 2002. On March 14, 2013, we changed our corporate name from Lapis Technologies, Inc. to Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. On July 13, 2018, following the sale of our former subsidiary Enertec Systems Ltd., we changed our name from Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. to MICT, Inc. Our shares have been listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MICT” since April 29, 2013. Prior to July 1st 2020, MICT operated primarily through its Israel-based majority-owned subsidiary, Micronet.
 
On July 1, 2020, MICT completed its acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of GFH Intermediate Holdings Ltd.

Accordingly, after the Merger, MICT’s includes the business of Intermediate, its wholly-owned subsidiary, operating through its operating subsidiaries, as described herein.
 
MICT’s Business Following Acquisition of Intermediate
 
Overview
 
Our current business, following the completion of the Acquisition, is primarily comprised and focused on the growth and development of the Intermediate financial technology offering and the marketplace in China. We aim and are in the process of building various platforms for business opportunities in various verticals and technology segments in order to capitalize on such technology and business
 
As a result of our Acquisition of Intermediate and the subsequent work we have undertaken with the management of Intermediate, we are positioned to establish ourselves, through our operating subsidiaries, to serve the markets as a financial technology company with a significant China marketplace and in other areas of the world. Intermediate has built various platforms to capitalize on business opportunities in a range of verticals and technology segments, including:” stock trading and wealth management; oil and gas trading; and insurance brokerage and is seeking to secure material contracts in these valuable market segments in China while developing opportunities, in order to allow Intermediate to access to such markets. We will continue to add to the capabilities of such platforms through acquisition and/or the license of technologies to support these efforts in the different market segments as more fully described below. By building secure, reliable and scalable platforms with high volume processing capability, we intend to provide customized solutions that address the needs of a highly diverse and broad client base.
 
We are planning to implement our plans taking advantage of Intermediate experience and experience in local markets in China, and through the Company’s operating subsidiaries which have begun to secure material contracts in fast growing market segments in China.
 
Our current valuable opportunities have given us access the following market segments:
 

● | Stock trading and wealth management
--+------------------------------------


● | Oil and gas trading
--+--------------------


● | Insurance brokerage
--+--------------------

 
As set hereunder, these opportunities are supported and shall further planned to be executed and realized through our business development efforts which as set forth herein include the acquisition of potential targets entities, business and assets (such as applicable required licenses) in the relevant business space and segments in which we plan to operate, which allow the Company to enter the market quickly and leverage on such existing assets in order to promote its growth strategy.
 
We have launched our insurance platform operated by GFHI for the Chinese market and from that day onward, we have been generating revenues in GFHI. While the revenues were not material in 2020, these revenues are building and we expect these revenues to grow considerably during 2021 as this business establishes itself in the market as a reputable service available to consumers.
 
Stock Trading and Wealth Management Platform
 
Overview
 
Intermediate is developing an advanced technology securities trading platform capable of making available to the investors and potential customers advanced investing tools by offering, through its operating subsidiaries, a fully digitized and mobile app-enabled brokerage service covering several markets. Harnessing the security, reliability and volume capabilities of this platform and its management’s longstanding commercial relationships in China, we will aim to provide investing services, including stock trading and clearing, margin financing, market data and information, and interactive social features to retail investors through our proprietary one-stop digital platform. The development of the platform is very advanced and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021.

As a result of our acquisition of Intermediate and our subsequent acquisition on February 26, 2021 of Huapei Global Securities, Ltd. (“Huapei”), a Hong Kong securities and investment services firm, with the completion of the acquisition we have now obtained the licenses and permits for operating the online platform and expect to launch the online stock trading platform initially in Hong Kong. This will be after rigorous testing to ensure scale and reliablility of the systems, once this is complete we will then be in a position to notifiy the Hong Kong regulator of our intended launch date of the new online trading APP.
 
Impact of COVID-19 and Our Responses and Opportunities
 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupted business operations of many companies, in China and elsewhere. We have taken a series of measures in response to the outbreak to protect our employees, including, among others, temporary closure of some offices, remote working arrangements for our employees and travel restrictions or suspension. Our Intermediate operations, including our services to our clients and internal control over financial reporting, have not been materially affected by these measures as we timely implemented our business continuity plan without any meaningful resource constraints.
 
Further, in view of the increased market volatility witnessed in the global capital markets which can attributed among other we expect that such volatility if continued may led to new account sign-ups, increasing trading velocity and higher net asset inflow, which may benefited our near-term operating and financial results. To date, we have not identified any material COVID-19-related contingencies or impairments affecting the Intermediate business.
 
We also observed that the outbreak accelerated Hong Kong retail investors’ migration from offline trading platforms to online ones, contributing to industry consolidation among the offline brokers.
 
We expect our stock trading and wealth management business to benefit from our Huapei acquisition. Many traditional financial institutions that rely heavily on offline account opening and customer service models have had to suspend the operations at their physical branches, which, at this difficult time, underscores the merits of a purely online one-stop financial technology platform like ours, where clients can enjoy an end-to-end mobile experience for everything from account opening to trade execution to margin lending.
 
The Platform
 
Technology will permeate every part of our stock trading business, allowing us, as a result of our Acquisition of Intermediate, to offer a redefined user experience built upon an agile, stable, scalable and secure platform. We aim to primarily serve the emerging affluent Chinese population, pursuing a massive opportunity to facilitate a once-in-a-generation shift in the wealth management industry and build a digital gateway into broader financial services. Following our acquisition of Intermediate, we are now growing our business through its operating subsidiaries, and intend to launch our stock trading business on the premise that no one should be precluded from investing on the basis of prohibitive transaction costs or financial industry inexperience. The platform is designed to provide an elegant user experience integrating clear and relevant market data, social collaboration and best-in-class trade execution. Over time, we intend to continuously enhance this technology and build a comprehensive, user-oriented and cloud-based platform that is fully-licensed to conduct securities brokerage business beginning in China and followed by other jurisdictions. We expect this to serve as a foundation from which we can execute growth strategies and operate efficiently offering the market strong competitive products.
 
Through Intermediate and its operating subsidiaries, we will be able to provide investing services through a proprietary digital platform, which is being built to serve as a highly integrated application accessible through any mobile device, tablet or desktop. We intend to surround these trading and margin financing services and enhance user and client experience with market data and news, research, as well as powerful analytical tools, providing clients with a data rich foundation to simplify the investing decision-making process.

We also intend to take steps to broaden the platform’s reach and promote the exchange of information through social network services. In contrast to traditional investing platforms and other online brokers, we intend to embed social media tools to create a user-centered network and provide connectivity to users, investors, companies, analysts, media and key opinion leaders. We expect this to foster the free flow of information, reduce information asymmetry and support the investing decision-making process. For instance, users would be able to exchange market views, watch live broadcasts of corporate events, and participate in investment education courses offered through the platform. Importantly, we expect such social networking tools to serve as a powerful engagement tool. User activities would provide us with invaluable user data which informs its product development and monetization efforts.
 
Market Opportunity
 
According to iResearch Report, the market size of the online brokerage industry focusing on global Chinese investors in terms of U.S. and Hong Kong stock trading volume experienced rapid growth over the past three years. This presents an attractive market opportunity for online brokerage service providers focused on the global Chinese investor market.
 
In addition, China has created the regulatory conditions which enable the access for foreign investors to trade in securities, while also allowing foreign parties to participate in the operation of securities businesses as major shareholders. As published by the Chinese government, it has expressed it willingness and commitment to supporting the finance sector as an important core area of competitiveness for the country. Recent launches of major two-way securities initiatives have included Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shanghai-London Stock Connect. In addition, the China Securities Depositary and Clearing Co., Ltd has liberalized one person-one account restrictions.
 
A-shares, which are shares of companies listed and traded in the China mainland stock markets, offer diverse opportunity for investors. There are more than 4,000 A–shares companies, with listings in either Shanghai or Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In market capitalization, or value terms, China A-shares market is one of the world’s largest markets with a total value of $10 trillion as of July 23, 2020.
 
The Chinese stock market, including A-share market, attracts investors to invest in new economy stocks.

Taken as a whole, the domestic A-share market has many dynamic companies in the technology and consumer spaces. Alibaba and Tencent, whose shares are both listed in the U.S., have already become household names among many U.S. investors who have admired the fast growth of these Internet and online shopping giants. Investors hope to find the next set of high-growth companies as they become available to foreign investors. Including A-shares, H-shares, Red chips, P-chips and N-chips, the Chinese stock universe has a market value in excess of $16 trillion as of June 30, 2020, according to a report by 21 Data News Laboratory.
 
According to data from China Securities Depositary and Clearing Co., Ltd, as of June 2020, the total number of A-share investors was 167,115,200, of which more than 99.78% were retail investors. According to a survey in the 2019 Investigation Report on Individual Investors issued by Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the average amount of stock account assets of the interviewees is RMB547,000, and the amount invested in stocks by the interviewee's accounts for 27.3% of the total family current assets.

Through Intermediate and its operating subsidiaries, we are developing an online investment platform to serve ordinary retail investors, focusing on remote account opening, artificial intelligence stock selection and intelligent trading functions through proprietary financial technology. The platform is expected to provide customers access to financial information, market conditions data, investment consulting services, a knowledge-sharing trading community, intelligent analysis and stock trading.
 
It is envisioned that revenues will be generated from stock trading commission income, interest income from financing and securities lending/borrowing, charges for intelligent stock recommendations and intelligent trading functions, charges from investment consulting and charges from stock trading strategy functions.
 
With popularization of mobile technology and growing acceptance of online trading, we believe that the online securities market is characterized by the following trends:
 

● | traditional brokers are shifting online while purely offline brokers are increasingly at a disadvantage or, in some cases, exiting the market altogether; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Internet giants continue to invest in online brokerage services, demonstrating the industry’s recognition of online brokerage services as an important component of a financial services business and potentially a gateway to broader opportunities;
● | technological barriers to entry remain high particularly relating to building a secure infrastructure that can transcend geographies and asset classes; 
● | operational barriers to entry remain high particularly relating to regulatory and capital requirements; 
● | user experience remains a key competitive strength as digitally born investors become a larger component of the addressable market; and 
● | revenue models are evolving as competition intensifies, with ancillary and other value-added services underlying platform differentiation. 

Challenges
 
Our ability to execute this business plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those relating to our ability to:
 

● | manage the launch of our trading platforms and our future growth; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment; 
● | offer personalized and competitive services; 
● | increase the utilization of our services by users and clients; 
● | maintain and enhance our relationships with our business partners; 
● | enhance our technology infrastructure to support the growth of our business and maintain the security of our systems and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across our systems;
● | improve our operational efficiency; 
● | attract, retain and motivate talented employees to support our business growth; 


● | navigate economic condition and fluctuation; 
● | defend ourselves against legal and regulatory actions, such as actions involving intellectual property or privacy claims; and
● | obtain any and all licenses necessary for the operation of our business.

Strategy
 
We aim to broadly provide a superior and comprehensive investing experience by focusing on delivering convenience and stability to our customers.
 
We have designed every step of our investing experience, from sourcing and researching ideas to trade execution and subsequent portfolio management, with a goal to create a simple and convenient experience. We identify the hurdles that investors, particularly retail investors, face along the investing journey, and we strive to mitigate inconvenience and information asymmetry through our platform with data and technology.
 
We recognize that investing is a meaningful component of our clients’ broader wealth management, for which the reliability and security of our platform is critical. With this in mind, we have built our platform to feature the following:
 

● | our platform features an automated multi-level protection mechanism to ensure the services and functions we deliver to our users and clients are secure; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we have adopted strict security policies and measures, including encryption technology and a two-factor authentication function, to protect our proprietary data such as clients’ personal information and trading data;
● | our cloud technology allows us to process large amounts of data in-house, which significantly reduces the risks involved in data storage and transmission; 
● | we back up our data at different servers spread across different locations; 
● | we process and execute all of our orders and transactions electronically, greatly minimizing risks associated with human error while maintaining the stability of our platform. 
● | our proprietary technology system analyzes and predicts malicious attacks and enables us to respond to challenges and attacks promptly. 

Our Services
 
Through Intermediate and its operating subsidiaries, we presently, and will in the future, plan to provide users of the platform and clients a comprehensive set of services throughout their investing experience. Our core services will include trade execution and margin financing. We intend to surround such core offerings with a variety of value-added services, including securities lending services, market data and information services, and user community and social interaction functions, many of which we plan to provide free of charge, to address the clients’ broader brokerage needs as well as increase general client engagement.
Trade Execution
 
We presently, and will in the future, plan to provide trading, clearing and settlement services beginning with account opening and extending through portfolio management. Opening a brokerage account has historically been a time-consuming and paper-intensive process, both for investors and brokerages. In developing our platform, we intended to break down this point of friction and meaningfully improve the account opening process. We believe that a significant driver of our client base growth is our ability to reduce unnecessary friction in the account opening process. Once a client has opened a trading account, they may place orders on our platform. Placing an order is simple and intuitive and involves identifying the securities and the size of the trade, either in terms of the number of shares or the value of the trade in instances where fractions of a share can be traded.
 
The trade execution process is entirely online and automated. We aggregate orders simultaneously and form trading instructions which are delivered to respective exchanges.
 
As a result of the operational efficiencies afforded by our technology, we are able to sustainably charge a lower brokerage commission rate for online trading as compared to many of our competitors. In general, our revenues from securities brokerage services includes brokerage commissions and platform service fees from our clients, which are recognized on a trade-date basis when the relevant transactions are executed.

Margin Financing
 
Our margin financing services will provide real-time, cross-market securities-backed financing to our clients. We have grown these services rapidly since introduction, a reflection, we believe, of both our ability to cross-sell as well as our clients’ receptivity to increasingly sophisticated investing tools delivered seamlessly.
 
Our margin financing services will offer margin financing to clients who trade securities listed on [the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the major stock exchanges in the U.S. as well as qualified securities under the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect]. All financing extended to our clients is secured by acceptable securities pledged to us. Our trading system can automatically pledge cross-market account assets so that the value in a client’s multiple trading accounts, which may include cash in different currencies and acceptable securities listed on the three markets, will be aggregated when calculating the value of the client’s collateral. In particular, this provides significant efficiencies as it eliminates the costs and procedures involved in cross-market currency translation or exchange.
 
Our clients are eligible for margin financing services when they hold securities that are acceptable as pledges to us in their accounts. The credit line for each eligible client is determined based on the securities across all of his or her trading accounts. The margin financing services for eligible margin financing clients are activated automatically, when the funds in their accounts are not sufficient to purchase the desired securities and there are still sufficient balance in their credit lines.
 
A list of securities acceptable as collateral to us and their respective margin ratios are regularly updated and shared with our clients. When we establish a risk management team, it will determine the margin ratio for each of the acceptable securities based on the trading frequency, historical price fluctuations and general market volatility. We also reference the financing terms of major financial institutions in establishing our margin ratios, and we typically find our margin requirements to be equal or lower. We believe this has differentiated our risk controls. Our margin ratios are monitored in real-time and our risk management team will reviewe and will adjust the margin ratio for each acceptable security on a regular basis and more frequently in the case of a significant and rapid price decline.
 
Once our margin financing business is launched, we will be financed mostly from our own working capital loans.
 
Users and Clients
 
We are growing Intermediate’s client base mainly through online and offline marketing and promotional activities, including those through external marketing channels that we will cooperate with and directly pay for as well as promotions and marketing campaigns conducted on the platform, word-of-mouth referrals, and our corporate services.
Risk Management
 
Through Intermediate, we are establishing a comprehensive and robust technology-driven risk management system to manage risks across our business and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. We will establish a risk management committee which formulates key risk management policies and procedures and a risk management team having relevant experience to execute these policies and procedures.
Data Security and Protection
 
Through Intermediate, we are establishing a comprehensive security system, to be supported by our network situational awareness and risk management system. The security system is designed with the capability to handle massive malicious attacks to safeguard the security of the platform and to protect the privacy of its users and clients.

Through Intermediate, we are establishing a data security team of engineers and technicians dedicated to protecting the security of our data. We also plan to adopt a strict data protection policy and stringent internal protocols to ensure the security of our proprietary data. On the client side, we plan to develop a dual identification verification function to protect its clients’ account security.
 
Competition
 
The market for online insurance brokerage services is emerging and rapidly evolving. Intermediate, through its operating subsidiaries, had positioned itself as an online Insurance brokerage company focusing its operations and business in the China marketplace based on its strong background and abundant resources in China. For example, in February 2021, Intermediate indirectly acquired a Chinese insurance brokerage company, Beijing Fucheng Insurance Brokerage Co., Ltd. Intermediate. It is competing with three types of competitors in this market, including pure-play online brokerage companies, hybrid brokerage companies featuring a combination of online and offline channels and brokerage business units within commercial banks.
 
Intermediate believes that the size of its user database and the capacities of the platform being built make it well-positioned to effectively compete with other insurance platforms. However, many current or future competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, stronger infrastructure, larger client bases or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do.
 
In the online stock trading business currently under development there are many competitors that are already operating of various sizes offering access to overseas markets and wealth management products. The Market is growing rapidly we are confident that our expanded product offering and marketing strategy will enable us to capture good market share.  
 
Licenses
 
Intermediate currently conducts its business in China through its operating subsidiaries, and is, therefore, subject to the relevant restrictions of the regulatory requirements of China, as well as the BVI.
 
Under existing PRC securities laws and regulations, entities operating securities brokerage business in the PRC are required to obtain a securities brokerage license; entities operating securities investment consulting businesses shall be subject to the approval of the CSRC and obtain the operation permit for a securities investment consulting business; and entities operating margin financing and securities lending businesses shall be subject to the approval of the CSRC and obtain the securities business operation permit.
 
Insurance Platform
 
Through its regulatory actions, the Chinese government has presented a policy-based opportunity for Intermediate to develop significant products for the insurance industry. This market has been opened to foreign investors, who are now allowed to have a significant ownership in insurance companies. Furthermore, foreign joint-venture companies may transact insurance business both online and offline. Major joint venture insurance companies in China include ICBC-AXA Life Insurance, CITIC Prudential and CMB-CIGNA.
 
Intermediate believes the addressable market in insurance to be very substantial in China. According to a report by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, life insurance revenues totaled RMB 2.2 trillion in 2019, while health insurance revenues were RMB 706,600 million. These figures are believed to be relatively small for a population of 1.4 billion in China. Local insurance companies in China still lack the range of products and levels of service offered by global insurers based in the US and Europe.

Intermediate has built an advanced online insurance platform based on proprietary technology, which is designed to achieve deep market penetration.
 
The insurance market in China is still comparatively immature compared to the insurance market in the West. Accordingly, it offers a poorer choice of products, and its use of technology is not as advanced or widespread, resulting in limited penetration of the potential insurance market in China. A large proportion of insurance sales in China are arranged by independent sales agents and small brokers, which encounter a range of problems, including delays in receiving quotes from insurers, delays in receipt of commissions and inadequate tools and technology to serve customers.
 
The technology and platform developed by Intermediate has been designed to address all of the problems encountered by both the customers and the sales agents, including through the improvement of the product range and access to such products, as well as increasing efficiencies and information handling. Intermediate intends to offer insurance premium financing to customers, while also accelerating commission payments to sales agents. This platform can be further developed, enabling additional services and products to be launched, such as medical advertising and financing, to create additional revenue streams.
 
Intermediate, through its operating subsidiaries, aims to offer a broad range of insurance products, including, but not limited to, life insurance, property insurance, motor insurance, accident insurance, travel insurance and medical insurance. We intend to drive insurance sales by attracting established sales agents to contract with the platform, as well as through commercial partnerships with some of China’s largest online portals and corporates. In addition, Intermediate will market its insurance products to users of its existing database of and it also aims to cross sell to customers of its other business verticals.
 
Revenues streams for the insurance brokerage are expected to come from commissions earned on insurance sales, as well as from finance fees, insurer marketing fees and through the monetization of Intermediate’s big data.
 
Intermediate’s technology is at the forefront of our insurance brokerage, including through the offering of user-centric online insurance platforms and apps, as well as through features such as insurance comparison tools. Technology is also utilized to provide an intuitive user dashboard, a range of innovative sales agent tools and a secure sales agent portal.
 
Intermediate, through its operating subsidiaries, has recruited a team of accomplished insurance industry and technology specialists, including senior executives from several of China’s largest listed and unlisted insurance companies, as well as from a number of China’s leading technology companies.
 
Oil and Gas Trading Platform
 
Intermediate currently develops and is looking to partner with a significant Chinese organization to build an oil and gas trading technology platform supporting two major elements of China’s energy sector.
 
In 2015, the Shanghai Free Trade Zone was incorporated and approved by the Shanghai Municipal People’s Government for construction, becoming a national oil and gas spot trading platform. The Free Trade Zone aims ultimately to become an internationally influential oil and gas trading platform, information exchange and financial market in its own right.
 
Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange (the “PNG Exchange”) is a national energy trading platform established in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone with ten shareholders comprising the Xinhua News Agency, CNPC, Sinopec, CNOOC, Shenergy, Beijing Gas, ENN, China Gas, Towngas and China Huaneng.

In 2018, the PNG Exchange had 2,242 corporate members with active members exceeding 500 companies. By the end of 2019, the number of corporate members of PNG Exchange increased to 2,571.
 
According to the China Central Administration of Customs China, crude oil imports reached RMB 1,669,697,209,337 in 2019. Natural gas imports were RMB 287,298,753,366. According to PNG Exchange, by the end of 2019, the PNG Exchange’s pipeline natural gas turnover was 71.296 billion cubic meters, and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) turnover was 63.323 million tons.
 
Separate from the Shanghai Free Trade Zone and representing an important element of the opportunity for Intermediate, the Ningbo Daxie Energy Industry Development Zone (the “Development Zone”) is located in the southern wing of the Yangtze River Delta, the most dynamic economic area in China. The Development Zone is the core area of the world’s largest port, Ningbo Zhoushan Port, closely adjacent to the international deep-water channel. The Development Zone is the first in Zhejiang Province with a revenue of more than RMB 10 billion yuan. It is the transit storage and transportation site of East China Energy, with annual energy trade sales of more than RMB 200 billion.
 
In 2018, the total import and export volume of the Development Zone exceeded RMB 30 billion, accounting for 69% of the total import and export volume of the region, an increase of 17.5% as compared to 2017. By contrast, the Development Zone’s crude oil and LNG import accounted for 7% and 12% of that of the country, respectively, achieving energy trade sales of RMB 222.5 billion yuan in 2018.
 
The PNG Exchange has built relationships to bring oil and gas offerings to leading commodity and futures exchanges within China. As a result, it is hoped that the PNG Exchange will significantly increase its market share of oil and gas trading within mainland China. Intermediate, through its operating subsidiaries, intends to provide services to a large number of the PNG Exchange’s existing clients as well as look to provide those same services to new clients that the PNG Exchange may capture as a result of moving into both commodity and futures trading for the first time. Intermediate, through its operating subsidiaries, will generate revenue through both transaction fees from the provision of services to its clients and the PNG Exchange’s clients trading on those platforms, as well as through the provision of margin financing to those clients and the rest of the PNG Exchange’s customer base.
 
Intermediate had secured a Domestic Class-A Member Service Charge contract with the PNG Exchange encompassing:
 

● | Providing trading, settlement and clearing services; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulations of Foreign Investment in Insurance Intermediaries
 
Historically, PRC laws and regulations have restricted foreign investment in ownership of insurance intermediary companies. In recent years, some rules and regulations governing the insurance intermediary sector in China have begun to encourage foreign investment. For instance, On March 1, 2015, the MOFCOM and the NDRC jointly promulgated the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (Revision 2015), or the 2015 Guidance Catalog, pursuant to which insurance brokerage are removed from the list of industries subject to foreign investment restriction.

Regulation on Oil and Natural Gas Market
 
The PRC government, though gradually liberalizing its regulations on entry into the petroleum and petrochemical industry, continues to exercise certain controls over the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China. These control mechanisms include granting the licenses to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas, granting the licenses to market and distribute crude oil and refined oil products, regulating the upper limit of the retail prices for gasoline and diesel; collecting special oil income levies, deciding import and export quotas and procedures, setting safety, environmental and quality standards, and formulating policies to save energy and reduce emission; meanwhile, there could be potential changes to macroeconomic and industry policies such as reforming of the oil and gas industry, further reforming and improvement of pricing mechanism of refined oil products and natural gas, and reforming in resource tax and environmental tax, which could impact the production and operations of the domestic petroleum and petrochemical industry. Such control mechanisms may have material effects on our operations and profitability.
Regulations of Oil and Natural Gas Price
 
Crude Oil
 
According to the Measures for Administration of Petroleum Products Price issued by the NDRC on January 13, 2016, crude oil prices shall be determined by reference to the international market price.
Refined Products
 
The prices of gasoline and diesel products are subject to government regulation.
 
On December 18, 2008, the NDRC issued the Notice on Implementing Price and Tax Reform of Refined Oil, which improved the pricing mechanism for refined oil products. Under the improved mechanism, the domestic ex-factory prices of refined oil products are determined on the basis of the relevant international crude oil prices, by taking into consideration the average domestic processing cost, tax and a pre-determined profit margin. The prices of diesel and gasoline continue to follow the government guiding prices. The highest retail price set for gasoline and diesel is calculated by using the relevant ex-factory price and a determined profit margin for retailing activities.
 
On March 26, 2013, the NDRC issued the Notice on Further Improvement of Refined Oil Pricing Mechanism and the amended and restated Measures for Oil Prices Management (on trial). Under this new system, (i) the price adjustment period was shortened from 22 working days to 10 and the 4% limit on the price adjustment range was eliminated; (ii) the composition of the basket of crudes to which refined oil products prices are linked was adjusted in light of the composition of the imported crudes and changes in crudes trading on the international market; and (iii) the refined oil products pricing mechanism was further enhanced.

Regulations of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Marketing 
 
Crude Oil 
 
Each year, the NDRC publishes the projected target for the production of crude oil in China based on the domestic consumption estimates submitted by domestic producers, the production of these companies as well as the forecast of international crude oil prices. The actual production volumes are determined by the producers themselves and may vary from estimates. The MOFCOM, and its local branches are responsible for supervising and managing the crude oil market. Enterprises that meet certain operating conditions may apply for the permit for crude oil sales and warehousing business.
Refined Products 
 
Previously, only certain designated companies had the right to conduct gasoline and diesel wholesale business. Other companies, including foreign invested companies, were not allowed to engage in wholesale of gasoline and diesel in China’s domestic market. In general, only domestic companies, including Sino-foreign joint venture companies, were permitted to engage in retail of gasoline and diesel. Since December 11, 2004, wholly foreign-owned enterprises are permitted to conduct refined oil retail business. Since January 1, 2007, when the Measures on the Administration of the Refined Products Market became effective, all entities meeting certain requirements are allowed to submit applications to the MOFCOM to conduct refined oil products wholesale, retail and storage businesses. On July 28, 2018, the PRC government removed the restriction that a Chinese partner must hold a majority share in the construction and operation of a retail oil station chain which has more than 30 outlets and sells refined products of different types and brands supplied through multiple channels. On August 27, 2019, the PRC State Council canceled government approval of qualifications for operation of refined oil wholesale warehousing and delegated the approval of refined oil retail qualifications to local municipal governments.
Natural Gas
 
The NDRC determines each year the annual national natural gas production target based on the natural gas production targets submitted by domestic natural gas producers. Domestic natural gas producers determine their annual natural gas production targets on the basis of consumption estimates. The actual production volume of each producer is determined by the producer itself, which may deviate from the production target submitted by it.
Import and Export
 
Since January 1, 2002, state-owned trading companies have been allowed to import crude oil under an automatic licensing system. Non-state-owned trading companies have been allowed to import crude oil and refined products subject to quotas. The export of crude oil and refined oil products by both state-owned trading companies and non-state-owned trading companies is subject to quota control.

Micronet is also currently focusing on sales to leading OEM’s vehicle manufacturers such as trucks leading manufacturers.
Research and Development
 
In order to keep up with the rapid technology evolution and the changing needs of the markets in which it operates, Micronet continues to focus on its innovation and the development of new products and technologies, by continuing to make the necessary investments in research and development.
 
Micronet upgrades and enhances its existing products on an on-going basis, including based on input from its clients and partners and from other sources. Enhancements include the addition of capabilities, improvement of product functionality and performance, and adding features to the existing hardware in order to offer customers a variety of solutions, while continuing to decrease costs to enhance its profit margins and create a competitive market pricing position.
 
In addition, Micronet seeks to design and manage product life cycles through a controlled and structured process. It involves customers and industry experts from its target markets in the definition and refinement of its product development. Product development emphasis is placed on meeting industry standards, ease of integration, cost reduction, design-for manufacturability, versatility and innovation, and quality and reliability.
 
Competition
 
Micronet operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements. During the last few years, competition in the field of mobile computers has significantly increased with the mass entrance and introduction to the market of smart phones, tablets, and laptops, as well as various GPS-based hand-held devices featuring additional functionalities. The direct competition in the field of dedicated laptops for the management of fleets is held primarily with OEMs, which provide products that enable application development and functional integration according to customer needs. To the best of Micronet’s knowledge, there are half a dozen such direct competitors operating in Micronet’s main geographical target market, North America. A large number of Micronet’s competitors are private companies or companies that do not disclose their sales or other financial information, making it difficult to estimate Micronet’s market share and position in the market. Micronet believes that its most significant competitors is CalAmp Corp., Mobile Devices (France), many of which may have substantially greater financial resources, development capacities and name recognition and access to consumers than we do.

Manufacturing
 
Micronet conducts its manufacturing activities mainly through third party subcontractors in Israel and outside of Israel and also using its Israel based facilities. Micronet is an ISO 9001-2008 and ISO 14001 certified organization.
 
Micronet is utilizing overseas manufacturers and subcontractors for its product offerings, in combination with its internal manufacturing capabilities. Micronet is focused on its core competencies, which include research, development, marketing and support activities.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Proprietary rights are important to Micronet’s business because its ability to remain competitive in the market is dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary solutions and products and the technology on which they are based. To protect its proprietary rights, Micronet primarily relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, internal know-how, and agreements with third parties, such as license agreements. In addition, Micronet employs internal controls such as the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Micronet believes its proprietary technology incorporates processes, know-how, methods, algorithms, hardware and software that are the result of more than 38 years of experience and in-house expertise and thus are not easily copied. While there is a significant amount of litigation with respect to intellectual property in the industry in which Micronet operates, Micronet has not, to date, been the subject of any claims or proceedings with regards to infringement of third party’s proprietary rights and it believes that its products, solutions and services do not violate or infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights.
 
In light of the strong competition in the industry and the innovative solutions and technologies incorporated by Micronet into its recent products, Micronet has been exploring the use of patent applications and is in the process of filing certain patent applications related to its products in the United States, solutions and proprietary technologies. These patents, to the extent granted, are expected to assist Micronet to maintain its technological and competitive position in the market. Micronet’s management, together with its research and development team, monitor closely and continuously all technological developments in the market. Micronet considers and evaluates on an ad hoc basis whether technology and proprietary assets should be acquired through independent in-house development or through the purchase of patents or other technological licenses. Where the purchase of third party proprietary technology, solution or products is required and can be of advantage to its business, Micronet would purchase a license and pay appropriate royalties or license fees. Micronet currently has all third-party licenses or is in the process of acquiring licenses that it believes are necessary to maintain and develop its business.
 
Government Regulation
 
Micronet’s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, European Conformity, or CE, and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in Europe by the European Commission and in the United States by the FCC. Its solutions and products also comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile.
Employees
 
Micronet’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and Micronet has never experienced a work stoppage. To the best of our knowledge, we have good and sustainable relations with our employees, respectively. Israeli labor laws and regulations apply to all employees based in Israel. The laws principally address matters such as paid vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday, payment for overtime and severance payments upon the retirement or death of an employee or termination of employment under specified circumstances. The severance payments may be funded, in whole or in part, through a managers’ insurance fund or a pension fund. The payments to the managers’ insurance fund or pension fund toward severance amount to 8.3% of wages. Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute of Israel. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for health insurance.

Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, MICT, Intermediate and/or Micronet may become subject to litigation incidental to its business.
 
In March 2017, MICT entered into the Sunrise Agreement with Sunrise through Sunrise’s principal, Amnon Mandelbaum, pursuant to which Sunrise agreed to assist MICT in identifying, analyzing, structuring, and negotiating suitable business opportunities, such as a sale of stock or assets, merger, tender offer, joint venture, financing arrangement, private placement, or any similar transaction or combination thereof. The parties initially disagreed as to the amount of the fee that would be payable upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. There are also questions about the applicability of the Sunrise Agreement to the Merger, and whether or not Sunrise is properly owed any transaction fee upon the closing of the Merger. In any event, in order to resolve this matter, as of the date hereof, the parties have executed a settlement and release agreement for the release and waiver of the above claims in consideration for the issuance of freely tradable shares of common stock of MICT worth no less than $1,500,000 (the “Shares”), which Shares shall be delivered as follows: (i) 67.5% of the Shares to Amnon Mandelbaum; (ii) 7.5% of the Shares to INTE Securities LLC; and (iii) 25% of the Shares to Amini LLC). In addition, by no later than February 16, 2021, MICT shall issue 200,000 warrants to purchase 200,000 freely tradable registered shares of Common Stock of MICT and deliver original copies of such warrants within five business days of the date of issuance of the warrants. The shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall be registered on a registration statement. 150,000 of these warrants shall be issued to Amnon Mandelbaum; 50,000 of these warrants shall be issued to Amini LLC, or its designee as named in writing. Each warrant shall be exercisable into one share of registered common stock of MICT until one year after the date of issuance the warrants at an exercise price of $1.01 per share, and in any other respects on the same material terms and conditions as are applicable to MICT’s current outstanding warrants including, but not limited to, cashless exercise at all times from the date of issuance of the warrants until to the expiration dates of the warrants, certain exercise price adjustments, and other terms as are no less favorable to MICT’s recently issued common stock purchase warrant agreements. MICT was not able to timely file a registration statement to register the shares, and shares underlying the warrants per the settlement agreement. The Sunrise parties notified MICT that it has breached the settlement agreement. Subsequently, on March 30, 2021, MICT and the Sunrise parties signed an amended settlement agreement whereby MICT is required to make a $1,000,000 payment by March 31, 2021 and the share dollar amount set forth above was reduced from $1,500,000 to $500,000. Furthermore, if MICT is not able to file a registration statement with the SEC for the Shares by June 4, 2021, it will be required to make a $600,000 payment to settle the matter in full and Sunrise will not receive any MICT shares.
 
On September 22, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with Craig Marshak, or Marshak, in connection with a claim filed by Marshak against the Company and additional defendants. Pursuant to settlement and in consideration for a customary release and waiver for the benefit of MICT, MICT agreed to pay Marshak a sum of $125,000 in cash. Mr. Marshak then dismissed such claim. On January 15, 2021 the parties have executed an amendment to the settlement and release agreement in which MICT agreed to pay Marshak a sum of $315,000 in. Mr. Marshak then dismissed such claim.
 
On November 2, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with Maxim Group LLC, or Maxim, pursuant to which the Company and Maxim agreed to release one another from any and all claims arising out of that certain advisory agreement entered into by and between Maxim and BNN Technology PLC on February 22, 2018. In consideration therefor, the Company issued Maxim 269,107 shares of MICT common stock and agreed to file a resale registration with respect to such shares. The Company failed to timely file the resale registration statement and entered into an amendment to the settlement agreement on March 1, 2021 which required a payment of $300,000 in exchange for the return of 134,554 shares of MICT common stock. The $300,000 payment was made on March 3, 2021. In addition, pursuant to the amendment, the Company will be required to take all steps necessary to ensure that the resale registration with respect to such shares is declared effective within two business days of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Within one business day of the effectiveness of such registration statement, the Company will issue Maxim the remaining 134,553 shares. Furthermore, the Company shall offer Maxim price protection for the five trading days following the date of receipt of the Maxim shares liquidated by Maxim as follows: for any shares liquidated at a price per share less than $2.49 (“Protection Price”) during such period, the Company will remit the difference between the sale price and Protection Price. If the registration statement is not declared effective within two business days of the filing of the Company’s annual report, the Company will be required to pay $335,000 in full settlement of this matter and the 134,553 shares shall be returned to MICT.

In March 2017, Micronet received notice from a client, relating to tests performed by the client which, as alleged by client, revealed a defect in the materials included in the battery integrated into a certain product of Micronet, and that client further reported the issue to the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “Regulator”) in the form of a complaint. The complaint refers to an old product of Micronet that was sold during the years prior to the claim above. Similar problems in the specific product were previously handled under the warranty provided to the same client and included problem fixing, battery changing and software updates. Independent tests to examine the client’s complaint (including addressing the issue with the battery manufacturer) did not demonstrate any significant evidence supporting the claim made by such client. Micronet has engaged with the Regulator in discussions and to the date hereof Micronet has not receive any demand, or other formal response from the Regulator. As between the client and Micronet, the parties in commercial dispute in connection with the products supplied by Micronet to customer (while customer refused payment claiming damages and Micronet reserving its rights to be fully paid for ordered cancelled or not paid in full) and each party reserved its claims in this matter.
 
In February 2020, a former employee of Micronet filed a claim against Micronet in the Israeli labor court for a total amount of approximately USD $150,000 alleging that he is entitled to receive various salary payments and social benefits which were not previously paid to him. In response to the claim, Micronet has filed its defense. The claim is currently being litigated, and the parties are currently submitting their affidavits in connection with the claim.
 
In June 2020, the CEO of Micronet’s subsidiary in the U.S. sent a demand letter addressed to Micronet pursuant to which the employee claimed compensation and severance for a breach of his employment agreement and demanded a sum of USD $230,000 as a severance payment. On February 17, 2021, the parties executed a settlement and release agreement in consideration for the payment of USD $90,000 and a mutual waiver and release of claims.
 
Sale of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd.
 
On December 31, 2017, MICT, Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd., or Enertec, previously our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Enertec Management Ltd., entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Share Purchase Agreement, with Coolisys Technologies Inc., or Coolisys, a subsidiary of DPW Holdings, Inc., or DPW, pursuant to which we agreed to sell the entire share capital of Enertec to Coolisys. As consideration for the sale of Enertec’s entire share capital, Coolisys agreed to pay, at the closing of the transaction, a purchase price of $5,250,000 as well as assume up to $4,000,000 of Enertec debt. On May 22, 2018, MICT closed on the sale of all of the outstanding equity of Enertec pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.
 
At the closing, MICT received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4,700,000 of which 10% was to be held in escrow (“Escrow Amount’) for up to 14 months after the closing to satisfy certain potential indemnification claims. The final consideration amount was adjusted, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, as a result of adjustments relating to certain Enertec debts at the closing. In addition, Coolisys also assumed approximately $4,000,000 of Enertec’s debt.
 
In conjunction with, and as a condition to, the closing, the Company, Enertec, Coolisys, DPW and Mr. David Lucatz, our former Chief Executive Officer and director, executed a consulting agreement, or the Consulting Agreement, whereby we, via Mr. Lucatz, will provide Enertec with certain consulting and transitional services over a 3 year period as necessary and requested by the Coolisys (but in no event to exceed 20% of Mr. Lucatz’s time). Coolisys (via Enertec) will pay us an annual consulting fee of $150,000 as well as issue us 150,000 restricted shares of DPW Class A Common Stock, or the DPW Equity, for such services, to be vested and released from restriction in three equal installments, with the initial installment vesting the day after the closing and the remaining installments vesting on each of the first 2 anniversaries of the closing. The rights and obligations under the Consulting Agreement were assigned back to Mr. Lucatz along with the DPW Equity.

In connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, based on an indemnification claim issued by Coolisys to the escrow agent alleging for breach of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Amount remained in escrow. On July 21, 2020, MICT management and MICT (the “Seller Parties”) received a statement of claim filed in the District Court of Tel Aviv by Coolisys against the Seller Parties and its Board members at the time of closing of the transaction, in the amount of approximately $2,500,000, (the “Claim”). Pursuant to the Claim, Coolisys is alleging that certain misrepresentations in the Share Purchase Agreement resulted in losses to Coolisys and requesting, among other things, that the Court instruct the release of the Escrow Amount held by the escrow agent to Coolisys.
 
The Company filed to the District court its defense to the Claim on December 15, 2020 which included a defense against the Claim as filed against Company and the defendant directors. In parallel, Coolisys has asked for an extension to file its answer to the defense and the parties are also negotiating a mediation process prior to litigating the Claim in court, which is planned to take place in the next few month. MICT and defendant directors have issued a notice of the Claim to its director and office insurance carrier seeking coverage. The insurance policies have been triggered, and the insurance companies are involved in the process. As of the date of hereof, the Escrow Amount remains in escrow, the annual consulting fee which the Company believes is due and payable by Coolisys (via Enertec) under the consulting agreement executed as schedule to the Share Purchase Agreement has not been paid and certain shares of DPW due pursuant to the consulting agreement were never issued to MICT.
