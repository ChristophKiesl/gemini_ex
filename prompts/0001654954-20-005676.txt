 ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
  
  Corporate Information
  
 We were incorporated on May 10, 2010 in the State of Nevada. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Premier Biomedical Pain Relief Meds, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company organized on September 14, 2017, and Health Stations, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company organized on August 28, 2019.
  
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Jackson Center, PA. Our mailing address is P.O. Box 25, Jackson Center, PA 16133, and our telephone number is (724) 633-7033. We have offices virtually in the homes of our management team who reside in Pennsylvania, Michigan and various other states. Our websites are www.premierbiomedical.com and www.painreliefmeds.com. Information contained on our website is not incorporated into, and does not constitute any part of, this Annual Report.
  
  Overview
  
 We were strictly a research-based company that intended to discover cures for PTSD, cancer and various other diseases. In order to fund on-going research and development in these areas, we developed a line of topical hemp oil pain relief products. We began selling these pain relief products in January of 2017 with a single product and currently have nine topical pain relief products.
  
 Through our continued development and expansion of proprietary drugs and treatments, we have reorganized the company into six technology centers: (1) extra-corporeal treatment of disease, (2) PTSD treatment, (3) anti-breast cancer drugs, (4) hemp oil/CBD pain relief products, (5) anti-aging treatments, and (6) chemical and alcohol addiction treatment.
  
 In the first quarter of 2017, initial sales of our pain management products were made through a joint venture. In the third quarter of 2017, the joint venture was terminated and we began sales of our pain management products directly from the Company.
  
  Joint Ventures to Research COVID-19 Treatment
  
 In April 2020, we signed a joint venture agreement with two other companies to pursue the funding and research and development on our patented extracorporeal therapy for the safe removal of targeted antigens from the blood and targeted organs. In the case of COVID-19, this entails removal of specific compounds which allow the virus to replicate, which may eliminate mutations of the virus. In preparation for the joint venture, we filed a new provisional patent entitled “Method for Treating and Curing COVID-19 Infection.” Following the start of the joint venture, we filed another provisional patent entitled “Method for Treating Covid-19 Inflammatory Cytokine Storm for the Reduction of Morbidity and Mortality in Covid-19 Patients”. It is too early to tell whether these technologies will have any practical application.
  
 On May 12, 2020, we assigned our rights in these two patents to Technology Health, Inc. pursuant to an Intellectual Property Agreement in hopes that they will be able to finance and develop the technologies. The assignment is part of an agreement with Technology Health, Inc., and two other companies to pursue a novel coronavirus extracorporeal treatment which combines our antigen mapping technique with Datatecnics’ laser ablation technology in a focused “Map and ZapTM” treatment protocol disclosed in a provisional patent application that is intended to eliminate COVID-19 antigens and potential mutations. Research is expected to start in the second quarter of 2020 to develop complexing agents to bind with coronavirus antigens which can be illuminated and eliminated using a computer-controlled targeting and laser system. The proposed hospital/clinic process would illuminate the compounded molecular target disease antigens for destruction by a nano-focus laser, and the purified blood would then be returned to the patient.
  
  Nature’s Pain Relief
  
 We have not yet launched our latest brand, Nature’s Pain Relief, which will be marketing 12 hemp oil products, including a 96-hour anti-pain patch, three roll-on topical products, two sprays, two ointments, one tincture drop product, a hemp oil capsule, and a “doggie” pet product. All of these products will be available through a new website at www.naturespainrelief.com.

  Pain Management Products
  
 We have developed and are now marketing all-natural, hemp-oil based products that are pesticide and solvent free. These products provide generalized, neuropathic and localized topical pain relief.
  
 We offer alternatives to dangerous and addictive opioid pain killers. In the past year we have rapidly expanded our product offerings, and we now offer eight pain relief products that are leaders in the pain-relief field:
  
   1.
 96-hour pain relief patch with 50 mg of hemp oil extract, the highest level of pain relief ingredient available in the industry;

 
   2.
 120 mg/ 10 ml water-based roll-on applicator;

 
   3.
 150 mg/ 10 ml oil-based roll-on applicator;

 
   4.
 150 mg/ 30 ml oil-based pump spray applicator;

 
   5.
 150 mg/ 2 oz. ointment;

 
   6.
 200 mg/10 ml oil-based roll-on applicator;

 
   7.
 500 mg/ 30 ml oil-based pump spray applicator; and

 
   8.
 500 mg/ 1 oz. ointment.

 
 We believe that this eight-product array positions us favorably in the topical pain relief marketplace. The topical pain relief market is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years, due to the focus on reduction of opioid pain medication use, and we intend to be a major player in that expanding market.
  
 Now that we have completed the product design and development phase, we are aggressively embarking on the product distribution and sales phase by:
  
   1.
 Expanding our online sales beyond our web site at: www.painreliefmeds.com;

 
   2.
 Securing the services of a social media coordinator to ensure that we optimize that promotional tool;

 
   3.
 Recruiting a National Sales Director to coordinate our growing field of sales representatives and distributors;

 
   4.
 Securing the services of a sales organization with expertise in marketing to the government and senior care facilities;

 
   5.
 Engaging an investor relations firm to facilitate television appearances designed to gain optimum exposure for our company and its products;

 
   6.
 Appearing in radio and television broadcasts, and podcasts, via Uptick Newswire periodically to ensure that our story gets out to the public; and

 
   7.
 Retaining the services of marketing firms to promote the Company and its products through social media.

 
   8.
 Establishing relationships with major distributors who will blanket specialized sales outlets such as pharmacies, doctors’ offices, convenience stores, long-term care facilities, large retail facilities, etc.

 
 In addition, we are in the process of seeking potential partnerships outside the United States to manufacture and market our products worldwide. We anticipate that these partnerships will make new markets available to us and allow us to rapidly increase our sales and profitability through favorable manufacturing arrangements.
  
 Customers indicate that they were able to achieve pain relief from our products and stop the use of opioid painkillers. Public awareness of the harmful side effects of opioid painkillers has grown significantly, and many states have initiated litigation against drug makers claiming they misrepresented the risks of opioid painkillers. As patients seek to cut back their use of opioid painkillers and look for alternatives, we believe demand for our products will see an increase. We intend to petition national insurance agencies to urge them to consider covering the use of our all-natural pain relief products as a safe alternative to opioid painkillers.
  
 Sales of our pain management products began on February 1, 2017 through our former joint venture. Upon termination of the joint venture, we began selling our products via our website at www.painreliefmeds.com and through various distributors. To date, three pharmacies and three chiropractic clinics have approved our products for sale and are distributing our products. We anticipate that our products will eventually be placed in several large pharmacy chains and sold in several states.

  Research and Development
  
 We intend to continue to discover and develop medical treatments for humans, specifically targeting the pain management industry and the treatment of:
  
 
– Cancer | – Fibromyalgia 
------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------
– Multiple Sclerosis (MS) | – Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
– Neuropathic Pain | – Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) 
– Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig’s Disease) | – Blood Sepsis and Viremia 


 
 To target cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, blood sepsis, leukemia, and other life-threatening cancers, we intend to develop our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique. The methodology involved in this technique is largely unexplored and has been described by scientists as the “wild west” of modern medicine. Consequently, our first entry into the therapeutics market for medications that work against cancer, multiple sclerosis, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes and traumatic brain injury carries significant obstacles before reaching the opportunities of a $700 billion industry.
  
  Feldetrex®
  
 We also are in the process of developing our proprietary drug candidate Feldetrex™, a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain and traumatic brain injury. The formulation used in the current Feldetrex® will be individually tailored to the various illnesses we intend to target, with each formulation being given a unique proprietary brand name. The annual market size of multiple sclerosis treatment is $500 million and the annual market size for all proposed Feldetrex® market segments is $16 billion.
  
 To overcome the significant obstacles inherent to the development of our Sequential-Dialysis Technique and Feldetrex® candidate drug, we are seeking to partner with prestigious institutions and pharmaceutical companies with the substantial infrastructure and resource capacity to perform experimentation and to engage in product development in an inexpensive and efficient manner.
  
 Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products and treatments that address major unmet medical needs, including initially, multiple sclerosis, septicemia, and cancer. We expect this goal to be supported by substantial research and development investments.
  
 We plan on conducting research internally and may also research through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies, and in cooperation with pharmaceutical firms. We may also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development methods and procedures or projects, as well as our future product lines, through acquisition, licensing or other arrangements.
  
 In addition to discovering and developing new products, methods and procedures of treatment and treatments, we expect our research operations to add value to our existing products and methods and procedures of treatment in development by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them.
  
  Sequential-Dialysis Technique
  
 Our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique is a methodology for the removal of those molecules which are harmful and responsible for causing diseases. A significant disappointment in the practice of modern medicine is that the capabilities do exist to eliminate the presence of most illnesses, including life-threatening diseases such as AIDS and cancer, but with a caveat that the process of treatment comes with catastrophic side effects that can and often do kill the patient.
  
 Our development is that the innovative Sequential-Dialysis Methodology is done extracorporeally (outside the body). This is a truly unique and innovative method for alleviating disease.
  
 We believe that this methodology can be used for the prevention of cancer metastasis, for directly attacking the causation of intractable seizures, for preventing the death of anterior motor neurons in ALS, for preventing the cause of the neuropathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury and for eradicating the causations of infectious diseases, and our intention is that the effectiveness of this technique will be demonstrated and supported in future clinical studies.
  
 Through our Sequential-Dialysis Technique, we ultimately hope to provide a cure for cancer if not only to dramatically extend the lives of suffering patients. Our initial focus is on lab and animal tests. Clinical trials, as required, will be undertaken subsequently.

  Feldetrex™
  
 Although a combination of generic medications, we have a U.S. Patent (No. 8,865,733) on our Feldetrex® candidate drug. In this way, Feldetrex® is similar to Viagra®, which was a proprietary cardiac drug prior to its current use and ownership by Pfizer. Consequently, we have one pending patent application for our Feldetrex® candidate drug—intending to increase our Feldetrex® related patent applications to three in the near future.
 
 Feldetrex® may serve as an additional medication utilized by physicians for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, or traumatic brain injury, and is designed to decrease symptomatology in those conditions. Feldetrex® will not compete against our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique in the market to treat traumatic brain injury, but rather the two will work conjunctively.
  
 Feldetrex® utilizes a low dosage of Naltrexone which has been shown in multiple medical articles in the medical literature to increase endogenous enkephalins1 (endogenous enkephalins are pain-relieving pentapeptides produced in the body, located in the pituitary gland, brain, and GI tract. Axon terminals that release enkephalins are concentrated in the posterior horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord, in the central part of the thalamus, and in the amygdala of the limbic system of the cerebrum. Endogenous Enkephalins function as neurotransmitters that inhibit neurotransmitters in the pathway for pain perception, thereby reducing the emotional as well as the physical impact of pain). We have not independently conducted medical or laboratory tests to show the mechanism of action of this medication. While Naltrexone in high dosages acts as an opioid antagonist, it inhibits opiate receptors. Naltrexone in low dosages causes a compensatory upregulation (increase in the number of receptors) of native endorphins and enkephalins, which last beyond the effects of the Naltrexone itself. We believe that this means, paradoxically, that a daily dose of low dose Naltrexone can be used to chronically increase endorphin and enkephalin levels. We believe that by utilizing a low dosage, Naltrexone has a unique ability to increase enkephalins and other neurotransmitters in the brainstem of patients.
  
  Marketing
  
 Currently, we manage our marketing responsibilities internally. Sales of our pain management products are made primarily online through our website: www.painreliefmeds.com. We intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms. These firms have the ability to effectively promote our product candidates to healthcare providers and patients. Through their marketing organizations, they can explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our product candidates to healthcare providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), employers and government agencies. They also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates the approved uses, benefits, and risks of our product candidates while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, they sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, important public health issues, and patient assistance programs.

  Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
  
 We have licensed three U.S. patents: Sequential Extracorporeal Treatment of Bodily Fluids, U.S. Patent No. 9,216,386 and Utilization of Stents for the Treatment of Blood Borne Carcinomas, U.S. Patent No. 8,758,287 (both from Marv Enterprises, LLC), and Medication and Treatment for Disease, U.S. Patent No. 8,865,733 (from Altman Enterprises, LLC), in the areas of cancer, sepsis, and multiple sclerosis. We expect these patents to cover the medical treatments discussed above for multiple sclerosis, blood sepsis, and cancer and be effective until 2029. Marv and Altman have licensed these technologies to us pursuant to the terms of license agreements. Because our license agreements cover the patents and “all applications of the United States and foreign countries that claim priority to the above PCT applications, including any non-provisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof,” we anticipate that other technologies that derive from these patents will also belong to us and are covered by the license agreements.
   
 In April 2020, Marv applied for two new patents: Method for Treating and Curing COVID-19 Infection” and “Method for Treating Covid-19 Inflammatory Cytokine Storm for the Reduction of Morbidity and Mortality in Covid-19 Patients”. On May 12, 2020, we assigned our rights in these two patents to Technology Health, Inc. pursuant to an Intellectual Property Agreement in hopes that they will be able to finance and develop the technologies.
  
 Patents extend for twenty years from the date of patent filing. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
  
 Dr. Felder is the owner of the Feldetrex mark, and has also licensed this to us pursuant to the terms of a license agreement.
  
 We expect our patent and related rights to be of material importance to our business.
  
  Competition
  
 Our business is conducted in an intensely competitive and often highly regulated market. Our treatments face competition in the form of branded drugs, generic drugs and the currently practiced treatments for multiple sclerosis, blood sepsis, and cancer. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Where possible, companies compete on the basis of the unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. Though the means of competition vary among product categories, demonstrating the value of our medications and procedures will be a critical factor for our success.
   
 Our competitors include large worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases as our major medications and procedures.
  
  Environment
  
 Our business may be subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. We intend to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 Regulation
  
  Pain Management Products
  
 A major obstacle to our growth is the public perception that hemp and marijuana are the same thing. This perception drives much of the regulation of hemp products. Although hemp and marijuana are both part of the cannabis family, they differ in cultivation, function, and application. Despite the use of marijuana becoming more widely legalized, it is viewed by many regulators and many others as an illegal product. Hemp, on the other hand, is used in a variety of other ways that include clothing, skin products, pet products, dietary supplements (the use of CBD oil), and thousands of other applications. Hemp may be legally sold, however the inability of many to understand the difference between hemp and marijuana often causes burdensome regulation and confusion among potential customers. Therefore, we are affected by laws related to cannabis and marijuana, even though our products are not the direct targets of these laws.

 Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession and/or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) describes Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in the states, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
  
 Notwithstanding the CSA, 29 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. The states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont (effective July 1, 2018) and Washington, and the District of Columbia, allow cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
  
 In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations.
  
 Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment) to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, since 2014 has prohibited the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with laws authorizing the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis from implementing such laws. On August 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment is currently effective through September 30, 2020, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually.
   
 These developments previously were met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry, but (i) neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 have yet been adopted, (ii) the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually, has not currently been renewed beyond September 30, 2018, and (iii) the ruling in United States v. McIntosh is only applicable precedent in the Ninth Circuit.
  
 Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.
   
 At the time of its issuance, the Cole Memo reiterated Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ was committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also noted that the DOJ was committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
  
   ●
 the distribution of cannabis to minors;

 
   ●
 revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;

 
   ●
 the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;

 
   ●
 state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;

 
   ●
 violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;

 
   ●
 drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;

 
   ●
 the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and

 
   ●
 cannabis possession or use on federal property.

 However, on January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the “Sessions Memo”) stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effective immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
  
 It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We do not currently cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis, but our hemp oil products are closely tied to the cannabis industry.
  
 Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
  
 On March 26, 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, announced plans to introduce The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 was a proposed law to exclude hemp (defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% THC) from Schedule 1 controlled substances and making it an ordinary agricultural commodity. Its provisions were incorporated in the 2018 United States Farm Bill that became law on December 20, 2018.
  
  Other Medical Products
  
 The development of proprietary drugs and medications is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the United States and any other countries in which our operations are conducted. In the United States, regulation by various federal and state agencies has long been focused primarily on product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Likewise, the approval process with the FDA is estimated to take approximately seven (7) years from the time it is started. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.
   
 Clinical trials are a set of procedures in medical research conducted to allow safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy data to be collected for health interventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols). These trials can take place only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non-clinical safety, and Health Authority/Ethics Committee approval is granted in the country where the trial is taking place.
  
 Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development, investigators enroll healthy volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies initially, followed by larger scale studies in patients that often compare the new product with the currently prescribed treatment. As positive safety and efficacy data are gathered, the number of patients is typically increased. Clinical trials can vary in size from a single center in one country to multicenter trials in multiple countries.
  
 Due to the sizable cost a full series of clinical trials may incur, the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor who may be a governmental organization, a pharmaceutical, or biotechnology company. Since the diversity of roles may exceed resources of the sponsor, often a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector.
  
 The regulatory agencies under whose purview we intend to operate have administrative powers that may subject us to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.
  
 Because we intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms, we anticipate that a larger pharmaceutical company will undertake to navigate the regulatory pathway, including conducting clinical trials, for a product such as Feldetrex™.
  
  Employees
  
 As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
