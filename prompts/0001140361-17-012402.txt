--------+---------

Overview
 
BioTime is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases. Our clinical programs are based on two platform technologies: pluripotent stem cells and cell/drug delivery platform technologies. The foundation of our core therapeutic technology platform is pluripotent cells that are capable of becoming any of the cell types in the human body. The foundation of our cell delivery platform is its HyStem® cell and drug delivery matrix technology. Our current clinical programs are targeting three primary sectors, aesthetics, ophthalmology and cell/drug delivery.
 
We also have significant equity holdings in two publicly traded companies, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Asterias”) and OncoCyte Corporation (“OncoCyte”), which we founded and which, until recently, were our majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries.  Asterias (NYSE MKT: AST) is presently focused on advancing three clinical-stage programs that have the potential to address areas of very high unmet medical need in the fields of neurology (spinal cord injury) and oncology (Acute Myeloid Leukemia and lung cancer). OncoCyte (NYSE MKT: OCX) is developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. The combined market value of BioTime’s holdings in Asterias and OncoCyte was about $146 million as of March 9, 2017.
 
BioTime, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates are sometimes referred to as the “BioTime Family of Companies.” BioTime is also enabling early-stage programs in new technologies through its own research programs as well as through other members of the BioTime Family of Companies. These technologies have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of diseases associated with aging, including diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, that affect large numbers of people. We are also researching other novel technologies that may help the body regenerate certain types of degenerated cells and tissues.
 
The BioTime Family of Companies currently has seven product candidates in human clinical trials, one of which is in a late-stage, pivotal study in Europe, one cancer diagnostic that is expected to be commercially launched in the U.S. later this year and several exciting early-stage programs that may help address some of the biggest unmet medical needs faced by our aging population.
 
Core Technology Platforms
 
We believe the BioTime Family of Companies has the world’s premier collection of pluripotent stem cell assets and a proprietary therapeutic delivery platform with many potential uses. Pluripotent stem cells are capable of becoming any of the cell types in the human body. Cell types derived from pluripotent stem cells have potential applications in many areas of medicine with large unmet patient needs, including various tissue injuries and age-related degenerative diseases and degenerative conditions for which there presently are no cures. Unlike pharmaceuticals which almost always require a molecular target, cell therapy strategies use cell types derived from pluripotent stem cells to regenerate, replace or augment affected cells and tissues, and therefore may have broader applicability and impact than traditional pharmaceutical products. Our pluripotent stem cell technology is complemented by our HyStem® technology, which includes a family of unique, biocompatible resorbable hydrogels to deliver bioactive compositions for therapeutic benefit.  HyStem® was designed to enable the effective transfer, engraftment and metabolic support for cells, whether derived from pluripotent stem cells or from a patient’s own somatic or adult stem cells.  The flexibility of the HyStem® technology also allows for direct therapeutic use and the sustained delivery of therapeutics.

Clinical Therapeutic Product Candidates Being Developed By BioTime
 
Our near term therapeutic focus is in three core areas:  Aesthetics, Ophthalmology, and Delivery
 

Facial Aesthetics
 
Renevia®, our lead facial aesthetics product, is a potential treatment for facial lipoatrophy. “Lipoatrophy” is another word for “fat loss or deficiency.” It is currently in a pivotal clinical trial in Europe to assess its safety and efficacy in restoring normal skin contours in patients whose subcutaneous fat, or adipose tissue, has been lost due to the use of certain drugs often used to treat patients with HIV. While this pivotal trial, if successful, is expected to enable a filing for marketing authorization in the European Union, BioTime sees this trial as also supportive of U.S. development of Renevia®, for the much larger market opportunity, for treating additional forms of facial volume restorations, whether from drugs, trauma or aging. Renevia® consists of our cell-transplantation delivery matrix (HyStem®) combined with the patient’s own adipose progenitor cells. Developed as a superior alternative for traditional fat transfer procedures, Renevia® is designed to mimic the naturally-occurring extracellular matrix and provide a 3-D scaffold that enables effective cell transplant, engraftment and proliferation. Renevia®, is being developed with the goal of providing a natural, long-lasting improvement to the patient’s skin contouring.
 
Ophthalmology
 
OpRegen® is our lead product for ophthalmological disorders. It is a suspension of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that are derived from pluripotent stem cells. RPE cells form the back lining of the retina, and support the function of photoreceptors (rods and cones). RPE cells can be damaged and lost in various forms of retinal degeneration. The OpRegen® therapeutic approach is to replace damaged or lost RPE cells and possibly slow disease progression and/or preserve or restore visual function. It is currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”). AMD affects approximately 1.6 million newly diagnosed people annually in the U.S and is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60. Approximately 90 percent of AMD patients suffer from the dry form (“dry-AMD”), for which there are no FDA-approved therapies.
 
In February 2017, we expanded our ophthalmology portfolio through the acquisition of exclusive global rights to technology from University of Pittsburgh through the execution of an Exclusive License Agreement. This technology allows the generation of three-dimensional laminated human retinal tissue derived from human pluripotent stem cells. This tissue contains all the cell types and layers of the human retina and has shown evidence of functional integration in proof of concept animal models for advanced retinal degeneration. The technology is being developed for implantation in patients to potentially treat or prevent a variety of retinal degenerative diseases.

Delivery
 
In addition to Renevia®, we have two additional primary programs utilizing our proprietary HyStem® technology. HyStem®-BDNF is a preclinical development program for the delivery of recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) directly into the stroke cavity of patients with the goal of aiding in tissue repair and functional recovery. ReGlyde™ is in preclinical development as a device for viscosupplementation and a combination product for drug delivery in osteoarthritis (OA). The viscosupplementation device program aims to administer ReGlyde™ directly into OA affected joints provide joint lubrication to reduce pain and improve quality of life. The drug delivery programs seek to enable the sustained release of therapeutics in affected OA joints to slow or reverse disease progression, in addition to improving pain and joint function. Also, included in our delivery platform is Premvia™, which is a HyStem® hydrogel formulation for the management of wounds including partial and full-thickness wounds, ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds, and burns. Premvia™ was cleared by the FDA via a 510(k) device approval pathway.
 
In addition to these programs, BioTime is developing HyStem® product enhancements. Current efforts are focused on the development of a frozen liquid product format, which, if successful, will make significant improvements in end-user convenience.
 
Products for Orthopedic Indications
 
We have a regenerative medicine orthopedic program that is a collaboration between our subsidiary OrthoCyte Corporation (“OrthoCyte”), and Heraeus Medical GmbH. The companies are developing innovative bone grafting therapies to address difficult to heal and/or compromised bone fractures based on the use of our proprietary PureStem® human embryonic progenitor cell (“hEPC”) technology.
 
Product Candidates of Public Affiliates
 
 BioTime has retained a significant, non-strategic equity interest in two public companies that were founded by BioTime, Asterias, and OncoCyte are focused on neurology, oncology and diagnostics. As of March 9, 2017, the combined value of these holdings was approximately $146 million.

Therapeutic Products in Neurology and Oncology
 
Asterias is presently focused on advancing three clinical-stage programs, which have the potential to address areas of very high unmet medical need in the fields of neurology and oncology. Asterias’ lead products are:

· | AST-OPC1 is a therapy derived from pluripotent stem cells that is currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for spinal cord injuries, with positive early efficacy data reported in September 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AST-VAC1 is a patient-specific cancer immunotherapy with promising Phase II clinical trial data in acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AST-VAC2 is a non-patient specific cancer immunotherapy for which the initiation of a Phase I/IIa clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer is planned for the first half of 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Liquid Biopsies for Diagnosis of Cancer
 
Our affiliate OncoCyte is developing confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. While current biopsy tests use invasive surgical procedures to provide tissue samples to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant, OncoCyte is developing a next generation of diagnostic tests that will be based on liquid biopsies using blood or urine samples.

OncoCyte recently conducted a 300-patient study of its lung cancer test. On March 6, 2017 OncoCyte announced the successful completion of the study. 
 

Early-Stage and Other Research and Development
 
We are also developing technology related to an exciting area of regenerative medicine relevant to diseases of aging. This technology, known as “induced Tissue Regeneration” or “iTR,” may provide a new means of treating diseases caused by the degeneration of tissues. In 2016, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Michael West, Ph.D., presented data generated from iTR. We are also developing technologies related to metabolic disorders based on the properties of brown fat, and therapies for vascular diseases, defects, and disorders. We also have several other early stage programs including our PureStem® cell therapy assets.
 
As part of our simplification strategy, we are looking at ways to attempt to unlock potential shareholder value associated with our early stage programs and the unique skills of Dr. West. One option under consideration is the consolidation of these early stage assets under the leadership of Dr. West.
 
We are also exploring other ways to fund these early stage opportunities that is consistent with our focus on clinical progress.
 
Strategy
 
We are transitioning BioTime into a clinical and commercial-ready company. Our near-term focus is to achieve three primary objectives:
 
Clinical Progress
 
Our efforts are focused on progressing our therapeutic products through clinical development. Our organizational capabilities are being aligned to execute on this objective to better position us to design, execute and oversee trials, with the goal of generating significant value-creating data in the near-term, and enabling future commercialization. Clinical progress success will allow the company to create greater value for investors, as well as allow us to better resource several other programs that are based on our core technologies.
Simplification
 
We will continue to work on simplifying our corporate, financial and organizational structure to allow us to execute our objectives more efficiently, while also making it much easier for investors, and other external stakeholders, to better understand our company.

Unlocking value
 
Our purpose is to deliver therapies for significant unmet, or under-met, needs to patients, while creating value for our investors. We believe that we have several valuable assets within the BioTime Family of Companies. We have been successful in unlocking the value of these assets through the execution of various strategies, including partnering, or sale, of non-core assets, creation of companies, spin-outs, distributions, simplification actions and other tactics we may develop.
 
2016 Highlights
 
The BioTime Family of Companies achieved numerous strategic accomplishments during 2016, including advancing clinical trials and product development in several key programs.
 
Clinical Progress
 
 
● | We presented positive early Renevia® data at the International Federation for Adipose Therapeutics and Science meeting (IFATS) meeting in November. The data related to the treatment of the initial 9 run-in patients for BioTime’s ongoing pivotal clinical trial in Europe assessing the efficacy of Renevia® for the treatment of HIV-associated lipoatrophy. In December, we achieved the recruitment milestone of 50 patients enrolled in the trial. We plan to stop enrollment in the trial in the first half of 2017 and to file for EU CE marking in the second half of 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We presented positive early OpRegen® data at the International Symposium on Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ISOPT) in December. The data from the first cohort in the Phase I/IIa clinical trial of OpRegen® in the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry-AMD). By end of year 2017, some 1-year follow-up of cohort 2 and data from cohort 3 and beginning enrollment of cohort 4 are expected to be completed. OpRegen® has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Initial feasibility of our next-generation retinal restoration technology demonstrates engraftment of laboratory grown three-dimensional laminated human retinal tissue and functional recovery of blind rats, which was described in three presentations at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in November 2016 in San Diego by Dr. Igor Nasonkin, lab head at BioTime and at a presentation at the ISSCR congress in Basel Switzerland in February 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In November 2016, Asterias successfully administered the highest dose of 20 million cells of AST-OPC1 to a patient with complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) as part of the SCiStar Phase I/IIa clinical trial. In January 2017, Asterias announced positive efficacy results that showed additional motor function improvement at 6-months and 9-months following administration of 10 million AST-OPC1 cells in 6 AIS-A patients with complete cervical SCI. The results suggest that the improvements in arm, hand and finger function observed earlier in the study have been maintained and even further enhanced over time in most patients. Twelve-month efficacy and safety data for this cohort, as well as 6-month efficacy and safety data for the currently-enrolling AIS-A 20 million cell and AIS-B 10 million cell cohorts are expected during the third quarter of 2017. Asterias also plans to initiate discussions with the FDA in mid-2017 to determine the most appropriate clinical and regulatory path forward for AST-OPC1. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On March 6, 2017, in relation to its blood-based diagnostic test designed to aid physicians in the early detection of lung cancer, OncoCyte announced the successful completion of a study of 300 blood samples from patients with lung nodules that had been determined to be malignant or benign, and that it has locked the prediction algorithm of the test. Based on the study results, OncoCyte announced that it will begin ramping-up its commercial capabilities in anticipation of the potential commercial launch of the test. OncoCyte will initiate a clinical validation phase for the diagnostic. During this phase, OncoCyte will also continue to carry out analytical validation studies to refine its operational stage laboratory processes, and will apply for certification of its CLIA diagnostic testing lab. Upon CLIA certification, OncoCyte will conduct a small CLIA lab validation study to demonstrate that the full assay system utilized in the CLIA lab provides the same results on clinical samples as those obtained in the R&D lab. OncoCyte will then begin a clinical validation study on a new set of at least 300 blinded prospectively collected blood samples to confirm whether the sensitivity and specificity of the test remain within commercial parameters in a CLIA operational setting. Assuming successful completion of these steps, OncoCyte anticipates launching the test commercially in the second half of 2017.

· | OncoCyte presented data from an early study of the OncoCyte’s breast cancer test in a poster session at the 2016 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December. In January 2017, OncoCyte announced commencement of a 300-patient study for their breast cancer diagnostic test which is designed to replicate the successful findings from the earlier study. OncoCyte expects to complete this 300-patient study during mid-2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simplification
 
 
· | In May 2016, Asterias’ financial statements were deconsolidated from BioTime’s consolidated financial statements. The deconsolidation was a result of Asterias’ successful completion of an equity financing, which brought our ownership in Asterias to below 50%. Although our financial statements no longer include Asterias’ assets, liabilities or financial results, the value and changes in value of our shares of Asterias common stock will be reflected in our financial statements, which we believe will simplify our financial statements and may help investors better understand the financial performance and condition of BioTime’s operations. GAAP requires the consolidation of 100% of a majority-owned subsidiaries’ financials and results of operations even if the parent owns only a little over 50%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Similarly, as a result of the exercise of certain OncoCyte warrants held by certain OncoCyte investors, in February of 2017 OncoCyte’s financials were deconsolidated from BioTime’s consolidated financial statements. This deconsolidation is not reflected in this Report, but was reported in a Form 8-K that was filed on February 21, 2017, and will be reflected in BioTime’s future quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Unlocking Value
 
 
· | On January 4, 2016, OncoCyte shares were listed and began trading “regular way” on the NYSE MKT under the symbol OCX. This event triggered enhanced liquidity for BioTime shareholders who received one share of OncoCyte for every 20 shares of BioTime as a dividend at the end of 2015.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patent Portfolio
 
 
● | During 2016, the BioTime Family of Companies collectively had 44 new patents issued worldwide.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Non-dilutive Funding
 
 
● | In 2016, our subsidiary, Cell Cure Neurosciences Ltd. (“Cell Cure”), was awarded a grant of 8.4 million shekels (approximately $2.2 million) from the Israel Innovation Authority, or the IIA (formerly the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel) of the Ministry of Economy and Industry to help finance the development of OpRegen®. This brings the total grants received to date to approximately $9 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Company News
 
 
· | In June 2016, we raised $20.1 million gross proceeds from new and previous investors in an underwritten public offering of our common shares.

OpRegen® is a registered trademark of Cell Cure. GeneCards® is a registered trademark of Yeda Research and Development Co. Ltd. LifeMap Discovery® is a registered trademark of LifeMap Sciences.
 
In 2016, BioTime was led by the Co-CEO leadership team of Adi Mohanty, who is responsible for human clinical development, product commercialization, corporate and administrative functions and Dr. Michael D. West, one of the world’s foremost experts on therapies derived from stem cells, who is responsible for research, product discovery, and preclinical product development.
 
To efficiently advance product candidates through the clinical trial process, we have historically created operating subsidiaries for each program and product line. Management believes this approach has fostered efficient use of resources and reduced shareholder dilution as compared to strategies commonly deployed by the biotechnology industry in advancing various programs and product lines through development. However, the operation of our business through multiple subsidiaries and affiliated companies results in certain administrative expenses that we would not incur if all our operations were conducted within BioTime itself. Because of this organizational structure which has facilitated our fundraising efforts, the BioTime Family of Companies has developed multiple clinical-stage products, rather than being dependent on a single product program. We, and some of the other members of the BioTime Family of Companies, have also received substantial amounts of non-dilutive financial support from government and nonprofit organizations that are seeking, based on rigorous scientific review processes, to identify and accelerate the development of potential breakthroughs in the treatment of various major diseases.
 
Technology Platforms
 
Pluripotent Cell Technology:
 
 
BioTime believes that it and its subsidiaries and affiliates have the world’s premier collection of pluripotent cell assets. Pluripotent cells, which are capable of becoming any of the cell types of the human body, have potential applications in many areas of medicine with large unmet patient needs, including various age-related degenerative diseases and degenerative conditions for which there are presently no cures. Unlike pharmaceuticals that require a molecular target, therapeutic strategies based on the use of pluripotent cells are generally aimed at regenerating or replacing affected cells and tissues, and therefore may have broader applicability than pharmaceutical products. BioTime has two key pluripotent platforms, PureStem® and ESI pluripotent stem cell lines. PureStem® human Embryonic derived Progenitor Cells (hEPC) address significant challenges in regenerative medicine through their purity, proliferative capacity and ability to better predictably acquire tissue specificity or “differentiate,” into a broad spectrum of cell types in a simplified and controlled fashion. These advantages allow the production, on a commercial scale, of pure cultures of potentially therapeutic cell types that do not contain uncharacterized “undifferentiated” cell types. The ESI pluripotent stem cell lines are the first clinical grade human embryonic stem cell lines and they were derived under current Good Tissue Practice (cGTP) conditions. They are NIH-registered and are among the best-characterized and documented human stem cell lines available today, with complete genome sequence, STR-fingerprint and HLA-type data available.

HyStem® Delivery Technology:
 
HyStem® is a patented biomaterial that mimics the extracellular matrix (“ECM”), the structural network of molecules surrounding cells in organs and tissues that is essential to cellular function. Many tissue engineering and regenerative cell-based therapies will require the delivery of therapeutic cells in a matrix or scaffold for accurate anatomical delivery, cell retention and engraftment, guided tissue remodeling and proper function. HyStem® is a unique hydrogel that has been shown to support cellular attachment and proliferation in vivo. Current research at leading medical institutions has shown that HyStem® is compatible with a wide variety of cells and tissue types including brain, bone, skin, cartilage, and vascular and heart tissues.


 
The patented technology underlying our HyStem® hydrogel products in development, such as Renevia® and ReGlyde™, was developed at the University of Utah and has been exclusively licensed to us for human therapeutic uses. The HyStem® technology is based on a unique thiol cross-linking chemistry to prepare hyaluronan-based hydrogels. Since the first published report in 2002, there have been over 150 academic scientific publications supporting the biocompatibility of thiol cross-linked hyaluronan-based hydrogels and their applications as medical devices and in cell culture, tissue engineering, and animal models of cell-based therapies. Due to the unique cross-linking chemistry, HyStem® hydrogels can be injected or applied as a liquid which allows the hydrogel to conform to the cavity or space, and gelation occurs in situ without harming the recipient tissue. This property of HyStem® hydrogels offers several distinct advantages over other hydrogels, including the possibility of combining bioactive materials with the hydrogel at the point of use. Building upon this platform, we are developing the HyStem® family of unique, biocompatible resorbable hydrogel products.

Therapeutic Product Candidates Being Developed By BioTime
 
Facial Aesthetics
 Renevia®
 
 
We are developing Renevia®, a clinical-grade HyStem® hydrogel, as an injectable product. Renevia® is being developed to address an immediate need in facial aesthetic procedures, and certain reconstructive surgeries, by improving the process of transplanting a patient’s own fat progenitor cells to potentially provide a better looking, more natural feeling and longer lasting benefit. Cells obtained from a patient, such as adipose cells obtained through liposuction, can be transplanted back into the same patient at another location in the body without the risk of rejection and potential contamination associated with the transplant of allogenic donor tissues. However, the transplantation of cells without the molecular matrix in which cells normally reside often leads to widespread cell death or the failure of the transplanted cells to remain at the transplant site. The transfer of cells in Renevia® may resolve this issue by localizing the transplanted cells at the intended site and by providing a three-dimensional scaffold upon which cells can attach and rebuild normal tissue. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We are conducting a multi-site pivotal clinical study in Spain to assess the efficacy of Renevia® as a delivery matrix for fat progenitor cells to restore normal skin volume in patients where the subcutaneous adipose tissue has been lost to HIV related facial lipoatrophy. Lipoatrophy is a localized loss of fat beneath the skin and is most frequently a consequence of the normal aging process, but lipoatrophy can also be associated with trauma, surgery, drug side effects and diseases. Lipoatrophy is frequently experienced by HIV patients who have been treated with certain anti-retroviral drugs like Stavudine and Zidovudine. The resulting facial wasting ages the individual’s appearance prematurely and, along with a thinning of the skin, allows musculature and vasculature to be easily seen, resulting in what is commonly known as “the face of AIDS”. Treatment of the condition improves the individual’s self-esteem and quality of life.
 
 13
 

 
The pivotal clinical study design includes a minimum of 56 and up to 92 HIV positive males and females between 18-65 years of age. Subjects will be randomized with half in a treatment group and half in a delayed-treatment cohort, each receiving a single treatment procedure of Renevia® with autologous adipose cells harvested by liposuction and implanted in the mid-facial region. Patients are being monitored at one, three, and six-month intervals after treatment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Data from the run-in portion of the study (N=9) indicated that adipose progenitor cells (fat cells), obtained from a liposuction aspirate, remained viable and were observed to proliferate when combined with Renevia® hydrogel. Analysis suggests that the grafts retain volume over the assessment period, and the treating physician observed incremental volume was retained in patients who had progressed to the one-year follow-up evaluation. In addition, there were encouraging signs of new tissue regeneration observed. No serious adverse events were noted during the run-in portion of the study.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Renevia® is manufactured in the US in compliance with cGMP requirements and has been tested pursuant to ISO 10993 standards for implantable medical devices and shown to be biocompatible without adverse effects in animal studies. Our plan is to complete the pivotal trial during the first half of 2017 and file for EU CE marking at the end of 2017. While this pivotal trial will enable a European filing for marketing authorization, we plan to use this trial to support US development of Renevia® for multiple forms of facial lipoatrophy, whether from drugs, trauma or aging. Once we analyze the data for the study, we plan to continue our discussion with the FDA regarding a potential development plan for Renevia® in the U.S.
 
Ophthalmology
 
OpRegen®
 
Our lead ophthalmology product, OpRegen®, is derived from pluripotent cell technology. It is currently in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”). Cell Cure, which is BioTime’s subsidiary in Israel, is conducting the current clinical trial. OpRegen® is a proprietary formulation of retinal pigmented epithelial (“RPE”) cells developed to be transplanted into the patient’s eye, where the patient’s own RPE cells are missing. OpRegen® consists of animal product-free RPE cells with high purity and potency using a proprietary directed differentiated method. OpRegen® is formulated as a suspension of RPE cells. It was developed to address the high, unmet medical needs of people suffering from dry aged-related macular degeneration.
 
AMD affects approximately 1.6 million newly diagnosed people annually in the U.S and is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60. Approximately 90 percent of AMD patients suffer from the dry form (“dry-AMD”), for which there are no FDA-approved therapies.
 
 14
 

 
AMD is a major disease of aging and is the leading eye disease responsible for visual impairment of elderly persons in the US, Europe and Australia. AMD affects the macula, which is the part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision that is important for facial recognition, reading and driving. There are two forms of AMD, the dry form and the wet form. The dry form or dry-AMD advances slowly and painlessly but may progress to geographic atrophy in which RPE cells and photoreceptors degenerate and are lost. Once the atrophy involves the fovea (the center of the macula), patients lose their central vision and may develop legal blindness. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that about 1.8 million people in the U.S. have advanced-stage AMD, while another 7.3 million have an earlier stage of AMD and are at risk of vision impairment from the disease. Most people are afflicted with the dry form of the disease, for which there is currently no effective treatment. One of the most promising future therapies for age-related AMD is the replacement of the layer of damaged RPE cells that support and nourish the retina.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Preclinical studies in mice have shown that following a single subretinal injection of OpRegen® as a suspension of cells, the cells can rapidly organize into their natural monolayer structure and survive throughout the lifetime of the mice. OpRegen® is intended to be an “off-the-shelf” allogeneic product provided to retinal surgeons in an “easy to use” form for transplantation. Unlike other investigational treatments for dry-AMD and treatments for wet-AMD that require multiple, frequent injections into the eye, it is expected that OpRegen® would be administered in a single procedure, or once every several years.
 
 
On February 16, 2015, the clinical trial entitled “Phase I/IIa Dose Escalation Safety and Efficacy Study of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells Transplanted Subretinally in Patients with Advanced Dry-Form Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Geographic Atrophy” was initiated in Hadassah University Medical Center in Jerusalem. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of three different dose regimens in the treatment of the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry-AMD), a condition for which there is currently no FDA-approved therapy. The study will evaluate three different dose regimens of OpRegen® in four cohorts. All patients enrolled in the study will be 50 years of age or older, with the advanced form of dry-AMD called geographic atrophy with absence of additional concomitant ocular disorders. The eye in which the disease has progressed the most will be treated, while the other eye will serve as a control. Following injection, the patients will be followed for 12 months at specified intervals, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OpRegen®. Currently there are three study sites in Israel and two sites in the initiation process in the U.S. Enrollment in the second cohort, in which patients are receiving a higher and more clinically meaningful 200,000 cell dose started in 2016. Cell Cure intends to approach the DSMB in the second quarter of this year for approval to begin administering the next higher, 500,000 cell dose to the third cohort, and if approved, also begin the fourth cohort before year end. The most up-to-date data from patients in cohort 2 of the clinical trial will be presented May 7-11 at ARVO 2017 in Baltimore, Maryland.

Following the initial 12-month period, patients will continue to be evaluated at longer intervals for an additional period of time up to five years following injection. A secondary objective of the clinical trial will be to examine the ability of transplanted OpRegen® to engraft, survive, and modulate disease progression in the patients. In addition to thorough characterization of visual function, a battery of vision tests will be used to quantify improvements in reducing the progression of the disease. Research and development of the enabling technology of OpRegen® has been conducted at Hadassah Medical Organization (“Hadassah”), and the clinical development is being conducted by Cell Cure under an exclusive license from Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Limited (“Hadasit”), which is the technology transfer office of Hadassah.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Data from the first cohort of patients were presented at the International Symposium on Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ISOPT) on Friday, December 2, 2016, in Rome, Italy. In this cohort, OpRegen® was successfully administered with no serious adverse events. Retinal imaging presented suggested the presence and survival of the transplanted cells in the sub-retinal space for up to one year.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retinal Restoration
 
In February 2017, we acquired exclusive global rights to ophthalmology-related intellectual property assets from the University of Pittsburgh. The technology was developed, in part, in collaboration with BioTime scientists, and includes composition and methodologies to develop 3-D retinal tissue constructs from pluripotent stem cells for implantation in patients with advanced stages of retinal degeneration.
 
This technology will allow generation of three-dimensional laminated human retinal tissue in a controlled manufacturing process. This could lead to retinal restoration treatments for a variety of advanced retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.
 
Delivery
 
 
HyStem®-BDNF
------------



HyStem®-BDNF is a hydrogel-BDNF combination product made of our HyStem® delivery system with rhBDNF is in preclinical development for ischemic stroke. HyStem®-BDNF permits sustained local diffusion of BDNF into the peri-infarct tissue, currently in preclinical development for ischemic stroke. HyStem®-BDNF involves a proprietary formulation of the HyStem® hydrogel platform allowing a sustained release of BDNF, which is being developed to maximize tissue repair and recovery after neurological insult. Pre-clinical results indicate that when treating animals with focal stroke to motor areas of the brain, HyStem®-BDNF intra-stroke cavity injection results in BDNF diffusion from the stroke cavity into peri-infarct tissue over three weeks compared with one week for BDNF-only injection. The sustained release of BDNF in these animals is associated with improved post-stroke neurogenesis in the peri-infarct cortex, axonal sprouting in the motor system, and behavioral motor recovery.
 
ReGlyde™
 
ReGlyde™ is a proprietary formulation of the HyStem® hydrogel platform and is currently in preclinical development for viscosupplementation and drug delivery in osteoarthritis. Pre-clinical results are encouraging and have shown biocompatibility and preclinical efficacy signals in animal models.

Research and Development and License Agreements with Heraeus Medical GmbH
 
BioTime is developing cellular therapeutics for orthopedic disorders. During September 2015, we, through our subsidiary, OrthoCyte, entered into a License Agreement and a Research and Development Agreement with Heraeus Medical GmbH (“Heraeus”), for the development of innovative bone grafting therapies based on the use of our proprietary PureStem® human embryonic progenitor cell (hEPC) technology. Pursuant to the terms of the Research and Development Agreement, BioTime is responsible for research and development of a cell therapy bone grafting product using PureStem® technology and either HyStem® scaffold technology for delivery of bio-active components or scaffold technology owned by Heraeus or licensed to Heraeus from third parties.
 
BioTime is presently diligently developing bone grafting products for the Heraeus sponsored program. If sufficient funding becomes available, we may also test the utility of various osteochondral PureStem® cells that display potential to differentiate into cartilage-like tissues, such as intervertebral disc tissue. Cartilage defects and disease affect our aging population, and in particular osteoarthritis and spinal disc degeneration have a significant impact on the mobility and health of an aging population. Chronic back pain is one of the largest unmet health economic burdens in modern society. With more than 85% lifetime prevalence, nearly everyone is affected in their lifetime. In most cases, chronic back pain stems from the progressive degeneration of the avascular intervertebral disc tissue that cushions the vertebrae in the spinal column. This tissue is structurally and functionally similar to other cartilage tissues. Currently there are no treatment options for people suffering from degenerative disc disease other than risky invasive surgery to fuse the affected discs. A therapy that would slow down or reverse disc degeneration to delay or avoid surgery would have a great impact in the largest musculoskeletal unmet need. Various biologic approaches using growth factors or cells from different adult tissues are in various phases of preclinical and early clinical development, but so far none have proven to work effectively. The opportunity for BioTime to impact the disease process is an important differentiating factor from other competing technologies.
 
Product Candidates of Public Affiliates
 
Therapeutic Products in Neurology and Oncology
 
Asterias is presently focused on advancing three clinical-stage programs which have the potential to address areas of very high unmet medical need in the fields of neurology and oncology.
AST-OPC1 Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases
 
AST-OPC1 is comprised of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which are cells that become oligodendrocytes after injection. It has been shown preclinically to have three potentially reparative functions that address the complex pathologies observed at the injury site of a spinal cord injury. These activities of AST-OPC1 include production of neurotrophic factors, stimulation of vascularization, and induction of remyelination of denuded axons, all of which are critical for survival, regrowth and conduction of nerve impulses through axons at the injury site.
 
AST-OPC1 was tested in patients with acute SCI in a Phase I and a Phase I/IIa dose escalation (“SCIStar study”) trials that were initiated in October 2010 and March 2015, respectively. In January 2017, Asterias announced additional interim efficacy data from the SCIStar study on the patients who were enrolled and dosed in the AIS-A 10 million-cell cohort, which included the following observations:
 
Improvements in Motor Function
 
 
· | Upper Extremity Motor Score - For the five patients who had completed at least 6 months of follow-up at the time of the announcement, five of five patients saw their early improvements in upper extremity motor score (UEMS) at 3 months maintained or further increased through their most recent data point (6 months or 9 months, depending on the most recent data available for each patient).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Motor Level Improvement - For patients completing at least 6 months of follow up, as of the date of each patient’s last follow-up visit, 100% (five of five) had achieved at least a one motor level improvement (using the ISNCSCI scale) over baseline on at least one side, and 40% (two of five) had achieved two motor levels over baseline on at least one side, with one of these patients achieving a two-motor level improvement on both sides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety
 
 
· | The trial results from the Phase I/IIa study continued to reveal a positive safety profile for AST-OPC1. There have been no serious adverse events related to AST-OPC1 and data from the study indicate that AST-OPC1 can be safely administered to patients in the subacute period after severe cervical spinal cord injury.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Asterias expects to complete enrollment of its Phase I/IIa study in the second half of 2017, with interim updates occurring at various times in 2017 and 2018.
 
There are approximately 17,000 new spinal cord injuries annually (NSCIC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2016)). There are currently no drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) specifically for the treatment of spinal cord injury.
 
 17
 

The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation of AST-OPC1 for the treatment of acute SCI.
 
AST-VAC1: Autologous Telomerase-loaded Dendritic Cells
 
AST-VAC1 is an Asterias’ autologous (patient-specific) cancer vaccine designed to stimulate a patient’s immune system to attack telomerase. Asterias is developing AST-VAC1 for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”), the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. A Phase II clinical trial of AST-VAC1 was conducted and demonstrated that AST-VAC1 was successfully manufactured and released in 24 out of the 33 patients enrolled in the study. Twenty-one patients received AST-VAC1 in the study, including 19 in clinical remission and two in early relapse. AST-VAC1 was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Asterias has performed follow-up data collection on the 19 patients who were treated while in complete remission to determine the long-term effects of the AST-VAC1 administration on remission duration and disease-free survival. The results of this data collection were reported in an oral presentation in May 2015. Eleven of 19 patients (58%) remained in complete remission at a median follow-up of 52 months. These results compare to historical data suggesting that between 20-40% of patients would be expected to be relapse free at 3-4 years. Additionally, of the 7 patients in the higher risk over 60-year-old group, 4 (57%) remained relapse free at a median follow up of 54 months. Historically, relapse free survival rates in this population have been 10-20% at 3-4 years. Asterias has conducted an End of Phase II meeting with the FDA with the goal of reviewing the proposed clinical development plan for AST-VAC1.
 
The next major step in clinical development for AST-VAC1 would be to conduct a confirmatory Phase 2b study in higher risk patients over 60 years old.
 
AST-VAC2: hES Cell-Derived Allogeneic Dendritic Cells
 
AST-VAC2 is being developed by Asterias as an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase. AST-VAC2 is produced from human embryonic stem (“hES’) cells that can be modified with any antigen. In September 2014, Asterias entered into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CRUK Agreement”) with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited, (“CRT”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CRUK, pursuant to which CRUK has agreed to fund Phase I/II clinical development of AST-VAC2 loaded with the same LAMP-telomerase construct used in AST-VAC1. Under the terms of the CRUK Agreement, Asterias is responsible, at their own cost, for completing process development and manufacturing scale-up of the AST-VAC2 manufacturing process and transferring the resulting cGMP-compatible process to CRUK. CRUK is responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade AST-VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AST-VAC2. The Asterias technology transfer to CRUK has been completed and patient enrollment for this study is expected to begin in the second half of 2017.
 
Liquid Biopsies for Cancer Diagnostics
 
OncoCyte is developing diagnostic tests for lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer utilizing novel liquid biopsy technology. While current biopsy tests use invasive surgical procedures to provide tissue samples to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant, OncoCyte is developing highly accurate, easy to administer, non-invasive molecular diagnostic tests that will be based on liquid biopsies using blood or urine samples.
Clinical Trials-Lung Cancer Diagnostic
 
OncoCyte collaborated with the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology (“Wistar”) to develop one of the components of the confirmatory lung cancer diagnostic test in a large, multi-site clinical study. This collaboration involved a clinical study with over 2,000 blood samples obtained from patients with a high-risk profile for development of lung cancer, which led to the discovery of biomarkers that differentially express in lung cancer patients.
 
Confirmatory diagnostics are used in conjunction with a current standard of care screening procedure. A lung confirmatory diagnostic would be used in conjunction with Low Dose CAT Scan (LDCT) to confirm a suspicious nodule by yielding a secondary suspicious versus benign result. In the case of a benign result, the patient would not need additional invasive procedures to determine the presence of cancer. In the case of a suspicious result, additional procedures would be highly warranted.
 
In October of 2016, Wistar presented a larger proof of concept study at the Chest annual meeting, where it validated the results of the ATS study with comparable findings. In this larger analysis of 610 patients, showing that the biomarkers alone had an Area Under the Curve (“AUC” or “ROC score”) of 0.82, resulting in a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 62%. These results suggest that a diagnostic comprised of biomarkers and a classifier could help clinicians manage the intermediate size nodules in way that would both improve health outcomes by potentially avoiding morbidity and mortality associated with lung biopsies, as well as decreasing the overall costs of lung cancer detection.
 
 18
 

To provide independent validation of Wistar’s work, OncoCyte elected to develop its own assay system and algorithm using the biomarkers identified by Wistar. OncoCyte collected its own clinical samples from 300 patients over 26 sites nationwide. The study was designed to provide a set of samples that were geographically diverse, from different types of care centers, and representing a cross-section of the high-risk patient population with nodules.
 
On March 6, 2017, OncoCyte announced the successful completion of the study and that it has locked the prediction algorithm of the test. Based on the study results, OncoCyte announced that it will begin ramping-up its commercial capabilities in anticipation of the potential commercial launch of the test. OncoCyte will initiate a clinical validation phase for the diagnostic. During this phase, OncoCyte will also continue to carry out analytical validation studies to refine its operational stage laboratory processes, and will apply for certification of its CLIA diagnostic testing lab. Upon CLIA certification, OncoCyte will conduct a small CLIA lab validation study to demonstrate that the full assay system utilized in the CLIA lab provides the same results on clinical samples as those obtained in the R&D lab. OncoCyte will then begin a clinical validation study on a new set of at least 300 blinded prospectively collected blood samples to confirm whether the sensitivity and specificity of the test remain within commercial parameters in a CLIA operational setting. Assuming successful completion of these steps, OncoCyte anticipates launching the test commercially in the second half of 2017.
 
Clinical Trials—Breast Cancer Diagnostic
 
OncoCyte completed a strong proof of concept study for its breast cancer confirmatory test, and presented data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December of 2016. The study looked at serum from 100 women who had a mammogram with a result of BIRADs 3 or 4. The results of this analysis were promising, with a 15-marker model producing a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 76%.
 
OncoCyte is continuing development of a breast cancer confirmatory diagnostic by conducting a larger study that it expects will analyze blood samples from approximately 300 patients with benign or malignant nodules.
 
Clinical Trials—Bladder Cancer Diagnostic
 
As part of the clinical development of a urine-based bladder cancer diagnostic test, OncoCyte initiated a clinical trial in January 2014 and in May of 2015, they presented preliminary findings of their bladder research, which showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 83%. Sensitivity is the probability of detecting the presence of the disease accurately. A sensitivity of 90% means that 9 out of 10 cancers were detected. Specificity is the probability of accurately predicting not having the disease. OncoCyte has decided to pursue a co-development partner for its bladder cancer test.
 
Early-Stage and Other Research and Development
 
Treatment of Vascular Disorders
 
We are using vascular cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, and other technologies, to develop treatments for vascular disorders. The therapeutic indications we are targeting include age-related cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. Therapeutics for age-related vascular disease represent some of the largest, fastest-growing actual and potential markets in the U.S. due to the aging baby boom generation. Cardiovascular disease is among the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S., and consumes a major and ever-increasing proportion of health care costs. The National Academy of Sciences has estimated that a potential 58 million Americans are currently afflicted with cardiovascular disease. We are conducting this research through our subsidiary, ReCyte Therapeutics.
 
During August 2011, we entered into a License Agreement with Cornell University for the worldwide development and commercialization of technology developed invented by Dr. Shahin Rafii and co-workers at Weill Cornell Medical College for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into vascular endothelial cells. We are using the Cornell technology in combination with the PureStem® technology to produce highly purified monoclonal embryonic vascular endothelial progenitor stem cells.
 
Brown Fat Technology for Treatment of Metabolic Disorders
 
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells, or as they are sometimes called “brown fat cells,” have only recently become the subject of intense study by medical researchers. Unlike normal white adipose tissue (WAT) which is the fat we normally associate with obesity and disorders correlated with obesity such as Type II Diabetes (T2D), BAT cells don’t simply store calories. BAT cells burn calories in the process of generating body heat. In addition, the cells secrete biological active molecules that are believed to play an important role in maintaining the body in a state of metabolic health. Recently it has also been reported that humans lose BAT as a function of age and the loss of these cells are implicated in unhealthy age-related changes in metabolism such as obesity, T2D, and metabolic syndrome. This recent discovery may have important consequences for regenerative medicine, since pluripotent cells provide a means of manufacturing all human cell types on an industrial scale, including BAT cells. Our research team has invented a technology to manufacture BAT cells and filed certain patent applications that it believes provides it with a path to develop BAT cells for the potentially large and growing markets associated with obesity and T2D. Prior to initiating human clinical trials, we will be required to successfully perform extensive preclinical testing of the cells to determine their safety and efficacy in non-human model systems.

iTR
 
When tissues in the human body are damaged as a result of degenerative disease, injury, or surgery, there is generally a very limited capacity of the body to regenerate the tissue back to its original state. Exceptions to this rule is blood and the liver, both of which both show a remarkable capacity to restore equilibrium after the loss of cells. Other exceptions are tissues in the human body when it is first being formed. Early in development tissues such as the skin can repair itself scarlessly, but this ability is lost even before we are born. Another example in the animal kingdom is the Mexican salamander which shows a profound capacity to regenerate damaged tissues, even restoring severed limbs. However, in the adult human, most tissues simply scar rather than regenerate. Our scientists have been performing certain research to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating this loss of regenerative potential after the human body is formed based on its expertise in pluripotent stem cell technology. As a result, these scientists have invented a novel technology we call “induced Tissue Regeneration” or “iTR.” iTR is designed to eventually facilitate the identification of therapies to induce scarless regeneration of tissues in the body that currently cannot naturally repair themselves. Examples of potential applications are numerous, but we are particularly focused currently on the regeneration of the heart following infection or heart failure, and scarless skin regeneration. iTR is a revolutionary new approach to medicine and as a result, the program will require us to communicate the science effectively to the scientific community and perform preclinical studies to demonstrate its safety and efficacy prior to any human clinical trials.

PureStem® Technology
 
ReCyte Therapeutics entered into a license agreement with Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., which later became Ocata Therapeutics, Inc. (“Ocata”) that was subsequently assigned to us under which we acquired exclusive world-wide rights to use Ocata’s technology for methods to accelerate the isolation of novel cell strains from pluripotent stem cells. The licensed rights include pending patent applications, know-how, and existing cells and cell lines developed using the technology.
 
The licensed technology is designed to provide a large-scale and reproducible method of isolating clonally purified human embryonic progenitor cells (“hEPCs”), many of which may be capable of extended propagation in vitro. Initial testing suggests that the technology may be used to isolate at least 200 distinct clones that contain many previously uncharacterized cell types derived from all germ layers that display diverse embryo- and site-specific homeobox gene expression. Despite the expression of many oncofetal genes, none of the hEPC tested led to tumor formation when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. The cells studied appear to have a finite replicative lifespan but have longer telomeres than most fetal- or adult-derived cells, which may facilitate their use in the manufacture of purified lineages for research and human therapy. Information concerning the technology was published in the May 2008 edition of the journal Regenerative Medicine.
 
We have the right to use the licensed technology and cell lines for research purpose and for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic products for human and veterinary use, and we also have the right to grant sublicenses. We paid Ocata a $250,000 license fee as well as an 8% royalty on sales of products, services, and processes that utilize the licensed technology. Once a total of $1.0 million of royalties has been paid, no further royalties will be due.
 
Ocata may reacquire royalty-free, worldwide licenses to use the technology for RPE cells, hemangioblasts, and myocardial cells, on an exclusive basis, and for hepatocytes, on a non-exclusive basis, for human therapeutic use. Ocata will pay us $5,000 for each license that it elects to reacquire.
 
The term of the licenses from Ocata expire on the later of July 9, 2028 or the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents. The latest expiration date of patents issued is October 12, 2026, but the expiration date of the licenses could be extended if the patent expiration dates are extended. Ocata may terminate the license agreement if we commit a breach or default in the performance of our obligations under the agreement and fail to cure the breach or default within the permitted cure periods. BioTime has the right to terminate the license agreement at any time by giving Ocata three months' prior notice and paying all amounts due to Ocata through the effective date of the termination.
 
HyStem® Hydrogel Technology
 
We have acquired an exclusive worldwide license from the University of Utah to use certain patents in the production and sale of hydrogel products, including our HyStem® products, excluding certain veterinary and animal heath uses. Our licensed field of use includes, but is not limited to, all human pharmaceutical and medical device applications, all tissue engineering and regenerative medicine uses, and all research applications.
 
Under the License Agreement, we will pay a 3% royalty on sales of products and services performed that utilize the licensed patents. We are obligated to pay minimum royalties to the extent that actual royalties on products sales and services utilizing the patents are less than the minimum royalty amount. The minimum royalty amounts are $30,000 per annum during the term of the License Agreement. We will also pay the University of Utah 30% of any sublicense fees or royalties received under any sublicense of the licensed patents.
 
We will also pay a $225,000 milestone fee within six months after the first sale of a “tissue engineered product” that utilizes a licensed patent. A tissue engineered product is defined as living human tissues or cells on a polymer platform, created at a place other than the point-of-care facility, for transplantation into a human patient.
 
We agreed to pay and an additional license fee for the additional rights licensed to us during August 2012, and the costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and maintaining the patents exclusively licensed to us, and a portion of those costs for patents that have been licensed to a third party for a different field of use.
 
Commencing in August 2017, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to sublicense to one or more third parties, on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between us and each prospective sublicensee, or re-grant to the University of Utah, rights to use the licensed patents for products and services outside the general industry in which we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees is then developing or commercializing, or has plans to develop or commercialize, a product using the licensed technology.

Research and Development Agreement and License Agreement with Heraeus
 
OrthoCyte has entered into a License Agreement and a Research and Development Agreement with Heraeus for the development of innovative bone grafting therapies based on the use of our proprietary PureStem® human embryonic progenitor cell technology. Pursuant to the terms of the Research and Development Agreement, OrthoCyte will carry out a research and development project aimed at producing a cell therapy bone grafting product, using PureStem® technology and either HyStem® scaffold technology for delivery of bioactives, referred to as the OrthoCyte Technology, or scaffold technology owned by Heraeus or licensed to it by third parties, referred to as the Heraeus Technology. The OrthoCyte Technology includes technology owned by it or BioTime or licensed from third parties.
 
Under the terms of the Research and Development Agreement, Heraeus agreed to make certain payments to OrthoCyte upon achieving certain milestones, and will reimburse OrthoCyte for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the project. The Research and Development Agreement is effective until the completion and payment of the last milestone set forth in the project plan, but may be terminated by either party immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party fails to remedy any material breach of the agreement within 90 days following receipt of written notice of such breach. Heraeus had additional industry standard termination rights. OrthoCyte has also licensed the OrthoCyte Technology to Heraeus, and Heraeus has licensed the Heraeus Technology to OrthoCyte. The license grant by OrthoCyte to Heraeus is exclusive and worldwide in the field of bone grafting for all osteoskelton diseases and injuries, except oral maxilla-facial. The license grant by Heraeus to OrthoCyte is exclusive and worldwide in all other fields. Pursuant to the License Agreement, each of Heraeus and OrthoCyte will pay certain specified royalties to each other based on their respective net sales of the product developed in the research and development project. The License Agreement contains customary confidentiality obligations, and representations and warranties, and termination provisions.
 
Hadasit Research and License Agreement
 
Cell Cure has entered into an Amended and Restated Research and License Agreement with Hadasit under which it received an exclusive license to use certain of Hadasit’s patented technologies for the development and commercialization for pluripotent stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies for retinal degenerative diseases. Cell Cure paid Hadasit 249,058 New Israeli Shekels as a reimbursement for patent expenses incurred by Hadasit, and pays Hadasit quarterly fees for research and product development services under a related Product Development Agreement.
 
If Cell Cure grants, subject to the terms of the Amended and Restated Research and License Agreement, a sublicense to any strategic partner comparable to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (a “Strategic Partner”), Cell Cure will pay Hadasit 30% of all sublicensing payments made by said Strategic Partner to Cell Cure, other than payments for research, reimbursements of patent expenses, loans or equity investments, provided that the minimum payments due to Hadasit in respect of amounts which constitute royalties based on sales of licensed products by the Strategic Partner, its affiliates or sublicensees shall not be less than 1.2% of the underlying net sales.
 
If Cell Cure does not grant a sublicense to a Strategic Partner but instead commercializes OpRegen® itself or sublicenses the Hadasit patents to a third party for the completion of development or commercialization of OpRegen®, Cell Cure will pay Hadasit a 5% royalty on sales of products that utilize the licensed technology. Cell Cure will also pay sublicensing fees ranging from 10% to 30% of any payments Cell Cure receives from sublicensing the Hadasit patents. Commencing in January 2017, Hadasit will be entitled to receive an annual minimum royalty payment of $100,000 that will be credited toward the payment of royalties and sublicense fees otherwise payable to Hadasit during the calendar year. If Cell Cure or a sublicensee other than a Strategic Partner paid royalties during the previous year, Cell Cure may defer making the minimum royalty payment until December and will be obligated to make the minimum annual payment to the extent that royalties and sublicensing fee payments made during that year are less than $100,000.
 
If Cell Cure does not grant a sublicense to a Strategic Partner and Cell Cure or a sublicensee (other than a Strategic Partner) conducts clinical trials of OpRegen®, Hadasit will be entitled to receive certain payments from Cell Cure upon the first attainment of certain clinical trial milestones in the process of seeking regulatory approval to market a product developed by Cell Cure using the licensed patents. Hadasit will receive $250,000 upon the completion of the enrollment of patients in the first Phase I clinical trial, $250,000 upon the submission of a report summarizing the Phase II clinical trial data to a regulatory agency as part of the approval process, and $1 million upon the enrollment of the first patient in the first Phase III clinical trial. These milestone payments are creditable by Cell Cure against sublicensing receipts that are payable to Hadasit at the time of each milestone payment for said milestone payment, except that the $1.0 million milestone payment shall only be creditable by Cell Cure if it received sublicensing receipts in excess of the amount of $50 million.
 
The Hadasit license agreement will automatically expire upon the later of (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patents or (ii) 15 years following the first sale of a product developed using a licensed patent on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. After expiration of the license agreement, Cell Cure will have the right to exploit the Hadasit licensed patents without having to pay Hadasit any royalties or sublicensing fees. Either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a breach or default in the performance of its obligations under the agreement and fails to cure the breach or default within the permitted cure periods.

Cornell University
 
During August 2011, we entered into a License Agreement with Cornell University for the worldwide, exclusive development and commercialization of technology developed at Weill Cornell Medical College for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into vascular endothelial cells. The technology may provide an improved means of generating vascular endothelial cells on an industrial scale, and will be utilized by us in diverse products, including those under development at our subsidiary ReCyte Therapeutics to treat age-related vascular disease. Cornell will be entitled to receive an initial license fee and annual license maintenance fees. The obligation to pay annual license maintenance fees will end when the first human therapeutic license product is sold by us or by any of our affiliates or sublicensees. We will pay Cornell milestone payments upon the achievement of a research product sales milestone amount, and upon the attainment of certain FDA approval milestones. We will pay Cornell royalties on sales of licensed products and will share with Cornell a portion of any cash payments, other than royalties, received for the grant of sublicenses to non-affiliates. The license will expire on the later of (i) the expiration date of the longest-lived licensed patent, or (ii) on a country-by-country basis, on the twenty-first anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We have the right to terminate the License Agreement at any time and for any reason upon ninety (90) days written notice to Cornell. Cornell may terminate our license if we fail to perform, or if we violate, any term of the License Agreement, and we fail to cure that default within thirty (30) days after written notice from Cornell. Cornell also has other industry standard termination rights.
 
Cornell also may terminate the license or convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license if we fail to meet any of the following requirements: (i) diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of licensed products; (ii) annually spend certain specified dollar amounts for the development of licensed products; (iii) submit an investigational new drug application covering at least one licensed product to the FDA within eight (8) years after the effective date of the License Agreement; (iv) initiate preclinical toxicology studies for at least one licensed product within six (6) years after the effective date of the License Agreement; (v) market at least one therapeutic licensed product in the U.S. within twelve (12) months after receiving regulatory approval to market the licensed product; or (vi) market at least one cell-based licensed product for the research market in the U.S. within twelve (12) months after the effective date of the License Agreement. We may fulfill the obligations described in (i) through (vi) through our own efforts or through the efforts of our affiliates and sublicensees.
 
Asterias Cross-License Agreement
 
Under the terms of a Cross-License Agreement (the “Cross-License”) entered into by Asterias, BioTime, and ESI, BioTime and ESI received a fully-paid, non-royalty-bearing, world-wide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license in, to, and under the certain Asterias patents and related patent rights for all purposes in the BioTime/ESI Licensed Field during the term of the license. The BioTime/ESI Licensed Field includes all fields of use except any and all applications (a) to treat disorders of the nervous system, (b) utilizing the immune system to prevent, treat, or cure cancer, and (c) involving the use of cells comprising, derived from, or manufactured using, human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells for in vitro assay applications, including but not limited to drug discovery and development, drug monitoring, drug toxicology testing, and consumer products testing. BioTime has sublicensed its rights to certain subsidiaries.
 
Under the terms of the Cross-License, Asterias received a fully-paid, non-royalty-bearing, world-wide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license under certain BioTime patents and related patent rights and ESI patents and related patent rights specified in the Cross-License, for all purposes in the Asterias Licensed Field during the term of the license.

Manufacturing
 
Facilities Required—Stem Cell Products
 
We lease approximately 30,795 square feet of rentable space in two buildings located in an office park setting in Alameda, California. In addition, from February 10, 2017 until May 31, 2017, we are subleasing a small portion of Asterias’ facility. Our subsidiaries or affiliates, OncoCyte, OrthoCyte, and ReCyte Therapeutics are also conducting their research and development activities at our Alameda facility and OncoCyte is establishing a diagnostic laboratory there to conduct any cancer diagnostic tests that it may successfully develop.
 
Cell Cure leases approximately 1,128 square meters of office, laboratory, warehousing and cGMP production space located in Jerusalem, Israel.
 
Facilities Required—Laboratory Diagnostic Tests
 
OncoCyte constructed a CLIA compliant laboratory at our Alameda facility for the performance of any cancer diagnostic tests that it may successfully develop and commercialize. OncoCyte will be required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to operate its diagnostic test laboratory, including certification under CLIA, under the laws of the states from which it receives blood or urine samples for testing. See “Government Regulation -- Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation.”
 
Facilities Required—Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Hospira manufactures Hextend® for use in the North American market, and CJ Health manufactures Hextend® for use in South Korea. Hospira and CJ Health have the facilities to manufacture Hextend® and our other products in commercial quantities. If Hospira and CJ Health choose not to manufacture and market other BioTime products, other manufacturers must be identified that would be willing to manufacture products for us or any licensee of our products as we do not have facilities to manufacture our plasma volume expander products in commercial quantities, or under cGMP.
 
 24
 

Raw Materials—Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Although most ingredients in the products we are developing are readily obtainable from multiple sources, we know of only a few manufacturers of the hydroxyethyl starches that serve as the primary drug substance in Hextend®. Hospira and CJ Health presently have a source of supply of the hydroxyethyl starch used in Hextend® and have agreed to maintain a supply sufficient to meet market demand for Hextend® in the countries in which they market the product. We believe that we will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of starch for our needs in the foreseeable future, although we do not have supply agreements in place. If for any reason a sufficient supply of hydroxyethyl starch could not be obtained, a licensee would have to acquire or obtain by contract the use of a manufacturing facility and the technology to produce the hydroxyethyl starch according to cGMP if the licensee elects to continue manufacturing Hextend®.
 
Marketing
 
Online Database Products
 
LifeMap Sciences sells subscriptions to its database products to biotech and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The GeneCards® Suite, includes GeneCards®, the leading human gene database, LifeMap Discovery® the database of embryonic development, stem cell research and regenerative medicine; and MalaCards™, the human disease database.
 
Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Hextend® is being distributed in the U.S. by Hospira and in South Korea by CJ Health under exclusive licenses from us. Hospira also has the right to obtain licenses to manufacture and sell our other plasma volume expander products.
 
Because Hextend® is a surgical product, sales efforts are directed to physicians and hospitals. Hextend® competes with other products used to treat or prevent hypovolemia, including albumin, generic 6% hetastarch solutions, and crystalloid solutions. The competing products have been commonly used in surgery and trauma care for many years, and in order to sell Hextend®, physicians must be convinced to change their product loyalties. The market price of albumin has declined and generic 6% hetastarch solutions sell at low prices, which has caused Hospira and CJ Health to lower the prices at which they sell Hextend®.
 
In addition to price competition, sales of Hextend® have been adversely affected if certain safety labeling changes required by the FDA for the entire class of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend®. The labeling changes were approved by the FDA in November 2013 and include a boxed warning stating that the use of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend®, increases the risk of mortality and renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis, and that Hextend® should not be used in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis. Warning and precaution information is required along with information about contraindications, adverse reactions, and certain recent studies. The warning and precautions include avoiding the use of Hextend® in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, that the coagulation status of patients undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass should be monitored as excess bleeding has been reported with hydroxyethyl starch solutions in that population, that the use of Hextend® should be discontinued at the first sign of coagulopathy, and that the liver function of patients receiving hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend® should also be monitored.
 
Therapeutic Products and Medical Devices
 
Because our planned therapeutic products and medical devices are still in the research and development stage, we will not initially need to have our own marketing personnel. If we or our subsidiaries are successful in developing marketable therapeutic products and medical devices we will need to build our own marketing and distribution capability for those products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we and our subsidiaries will need to find collaborative marketing partners, independent sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of those products.
 
If we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. This means that our gross profit from product sales may be less than would be the case if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. On the other hand, selling to distributors or through independent sales representatives would allow us to avoid the cost of hiring and training our own sales employees. There can be no assurance we will be able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.
 
Laboratory Diagnostic Tests
 
Following CLIA certification of its laboratory and diagnostic tests, OncoCyte will market its diagnostic tests directly to health care providers working in the areas of cancer for which OncoCyte develops liquid biopsy tests. The health care providers will collect blood samples or send patients to laboratories to have blood or urine samples collected. The blood or urine samples will be sent to OncoCyte’s CLIA laboratory in Alameda California, either by the health care provider or the laboratory, where the sample will be run through an assay and a gene expression classifier to determine a binary result, either benign or suspicious. That result will be presented to the physician ordering the procedure in a standardized report. OncoCyte expects to ramp up sales and marketing teams in coordination with progress in the development of its diagnostic tests and over time will continue to grow its sales, market access and marketing organizations to increase the awareness and utilization of its diagnostic tests.

Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access technologies developed by other companies and universities and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others if we are unable to obtain enabling licenses.
 
As of March 6, 2017, we owned or controlled or licensed directly or through our subsidiaries approximately 850 patents and pending patent applications worldwide including more than 180 issued or pending U.S. patents or patent applications. We also licensed over 140 patents and applications from WARF.
 
Our patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter, formulations, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, as appropriate. In addition to patenting our own technology and that of our subsidiaries, we and our subsidiaries have licensed patents and patent applications for certain stem cell technology, hEPC, and hES cell lines, diagnostic markers, hydrogel technology, and other technology from other companies. See “Licensed Stem Cell Technologies and Stem Cell Product Development Agreements.”
 
The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our business could be negatively impacted by any of the following:
 
 
● | the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection, may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our patents may be challenged by third parties;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | others may have patents that relate to our technology or business that may prevent us from marketing our product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the pending patent applications to which we have rights may not result in issued patents;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not be successful in developing additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, duplicate any of our technologies and, if patents are licensed or issued to us, design around the patented technologies licensed to or developed by us. Moreover, we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we have to defend ourselves in patent lawsuits brought by third parties or if we initiate such lawsuits.
 
In Europe, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for patent protection. The European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern “uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.” A recent decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreted parthenogenetically produced hES cells as patentable subject matter. Consequently, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including human ES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003, and patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after that date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC.
 
The United States Supreme Court’s decisions in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics may limit OncoCyte’s ability to obtain patent protection on diagnostic methods that merely recite a correlation between a naturally occurring event and a diagnostic outcome associated with that event.
 
Cell Cure is presently a party to two pending opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office involving EP Patent Numbers 2147094 (issued 08-Oct-2014) and 2554661 (issued 19-Nov-2014), both entitled, “Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells”. The Oral Proceedings dates are 16-Mar-2017 and 17-Mar-2017, respectively. Both patents relate to our OpRegen® product and provide protection until April 2028. Cell Cure is vigorously defending these patents in the proceedings and does not believe the outcome will materially alter the protection or positioning of the OpRegen® product in the market. There are additional patent applications pending that if issued will provide further protection for OpRegen®.

We currently hold three issued U. S. patents with methods-of-use claims covering Hextend®. The most recent U.S. patents were issued during May 2011.Our patents in the U.S., which include claims directed to methods-of-use of Hextend®, are expected to remain in force until 2019. Patents covering certain proprietary solutions have also issued in several countries and remain in force in Canada, China, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and Taiwan.
General Risks Related to Obtaining and Enforcing Patent Protection
 
There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and be declared invalid or infringing on third party claims. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.
 
The enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third-party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, there is no assurance that our patents will be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.
 
In addition to relying on patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. We have entered into intellectual property, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and know-how, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets and know-how or obtain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary technology.
 
Competition
 
We face substantial competition in all of fields of business in which we engage. That competition is likely to intensify as new products and technologies reach the market. Superior new products are likely to sell for higher prices and generate higher profit margins once acceptance by the medical community is achieved. Those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant economic advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Such companies will also benefit from revenues from sales that could be used to strengthen their research and development, production, and marketing resources. Companies engaged in the medical products industry face the risk of obsolescence of their products and technologies as more advanced or cost-effective products and technologies are developed by competitors. As the industry matures, companies will compete based upon the performance and cost-effectiveness of their products.
Products for Regenerative Medicine
 
The stem cell industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering, and tissue regeneration. Many of these companies are well established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford the smaller companies’ potential research and development as well as commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities, which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing.
 
 28
 

We believe that some of our competitors are trying to develop pluripotent cells and hEPC-based technologies and products that may compete with our stem cell products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions. We are aware that Ocata, which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc., is conducting clinical trials of a hES cell product designed to treat age-related macular degeneration. If the Ocata product is proven to be safe and effective, it may reach the market ahead of Cell Cure Neuroscience’s OpRegen®.
 
We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the propagation and differentiation of stem cells. Those companies include Ocata, which in 2015 had certain US patents issue with claims directed to methods of producing RPE cells and isolating and purifying such cells. We may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain products proposed by us, and such licenses may not be granted.
 
Cancer Diagnostic Testing
 
The cancer diagnostic test industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. OncoCyte’s competitors include major multinational diagnostic companies and specialty biotechnology companies. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than OncoCyte’s. In addition, smaller biotech companies may form strategic collaborations, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies’ potential research and development and commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce diagnostic tests directly competitive to those OncoCyte is developing.
 
Molecular diagnostic competitors in the category of OncoCyte’s first planned diagnostic test launch (lung confirmatory) include two currently marketed diagnostic tests. Xpresys Lung was launched in late 2013 by Integrated Diagnostics and that company has recently announced coverage by major payers. The other currently marketed diagnostic test is Early CDT lung, which was launched in 2012 by a European diagnostics company OncImmune Ltd. OncImmune has sold its U.S. assets to a CLIA laboratory, operating under the name OncImmune USA, LLC. Additionally, OncoCyte anticipates competition from Exact Sciences Corp, Gensignia Life Sciences, Inc. and Veracyte, Inc. which have diagnostic tests in the pipeline. Gensignia announced the certification of its CLIA lab in October 2015.
 
In addition to molecular diagnostics, an imaging competitor has a diagnostic test that may compete directly in confirmatory lung diagnostic testing. VisionGate, Inc. has a sputum test that is read by their proprietary system, which takes an optical CT scan of individual cells to generate 3D images of each cell.
 
Plasma Volume Expanders
 
Our plasma volume expander solution, Hextend®, competes with products currently used to treat or prevent hypovolemia, including albumin, other colloid solutions, and crystalloid solutions presently manufactured by established pharmaceutical companies, and with human blood products. To compete with new and existing plasma expanders, we have developed products that contain constituents that may prevent or reduce the physiological imbalances, bleeding, fluid overload, edema, poor oxygenation, and organ failure that can occur when competing products are used.
 
Hextend® competes with products that are commonly used in surgery and trauma care, and some, especially crystalloids, sell at low prices. The competing products are being manufactured and marketed by established pharmaceutical companies with large research facilities, technical staffs, and financial and marketing resources. B. Braun presently markets Hespan®, an artificial plasma volume expander containing 6% hetastarch in saline solution. Hospira and Teva sell a generic equivalent of Hespan®. Hospira, also markets Voluven®, a plasma volume expander containing a 6% low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch in saline solution. Sanofi-Aventis, Baxter International, and Alpha Therapeutics sell albumin, and Hospira, Baxter International, and B. Braun sell crystalloid solutions. As a result of the introduction of generic plasma expanders and new proprietary products, competition in the plasma expander market has intensified, and wholesale prices of both hetastarch products and albumin have declined which has forced Hospira and CJ Health to make reduce the price at which they sell Hextend® in order to maintain their share of the market.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Laboratories performing diagnostic tests such as those being developed by OncoCyte are also subject to regulation at both the federal and state level. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products or HCT/Ps.
 
 29
 

FDA and Foreign Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs, biologicals, or medical devices, depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product with the human body. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologicals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. Many of Asterias’ proposed products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies.
 
Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission must be made to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three “phases.” Phase I clinical trials are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers or volunteers with the target disease or condition to assess safety. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials and are conducted with patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product.
 
No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the U.S. until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (BLA) has been approved by the FDA. Submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to FDA approval. To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any pluripotent stem-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.
 
The FDA offers several programs to expedite development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. A product may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. In December 2016, in the 21st Century Cures Act adopted a new designation of Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designation. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, a drug is eligible for designation as a regenerative advanced therapy (“RAT”) if: the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under certain other sections. the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Some of our current and future products may be eligible for RAT designation. RAT designation allows for similar benefits as the breakthrough therapy designation. There is no assurance that the FDA will grant breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval or RAT status to any of our product candidates.
 
Certain Medical Devices
 
Obtaining regulatory approval of Renevia® or a similar implantable matrix for tissue transplant or stem cell therapy in Europe will require the preparation of a design dossier containing details on the product manufacturing and production methods, analytical controls to assure that the product meets its release specification, data from analytical assay and process validations, ISO 10993 biocompatibility testing, as well as pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy data. Completion of the manufacturing, analytical, biocompatibility, and clinical trials represents a majority of the expenses associated with the regulatory application process in Europe. The procedures for obtaining FDA approval to sell products in the U.S. are likely to be more stringent, and the cost greater, than would be the case in an application for approval in Europe.
 
 30
 

 Combination Products
 
If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. For example, our HyStem® hydrogel products such as Renevia® may be used to administer one or more pluripotent stem cell-based therapy products. When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. There is an Office of Combination Products at the FDA that coordinates the review of such products and determines the primary mode of action of a combination product. The definition and regulatory requirements for combination products may differ significantly among other countries in which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
 
Post-Approval Matters
 
Even after initial FDA or foreign regulatory agency approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. Use of a product during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval, result in a regulatory agency-ordered product recall, or in regulatory agency-imposed limitations on permissible uses or in withdrawal of approval. For example, if the FDA or foreign regulatory agency becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, it may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known or potential serious risk and to assure that the benefit of the product outweigh the risks. If we are required to conduct such a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA or foreign regulatory agency. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which a product has already been approved.
 
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, human tissue and cell products, and medical devices, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP. See “Manufacturing.” The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories, processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made to manufacturing equipment or to the location or manufacturing process, additional regulatory review may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes of manufacturers following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that that equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the manufacturer, including suspension of manufacturing operations. Issues pertaining to manufacturing equipment, facilities or processes may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review.
 
FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion
 
The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biological products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA, a BLA, or a pre-market notification or pre-market approval application for a medical device (“PMA”), or an amendment to an NDA, a BLA or a pre-market notification or PMA, and must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Federal Funding of Research
 
The United States government and its agencies have until recently refused to fund research which involves the use of human embryonic tissue. President Bush issued Executive Orders on August 9, 2001 and June 20, 2007 that permitted federal funding of research on hES cells using only the limited number of hES cell lines that had already been created as of August 9, 2001. On March 9, 2009, President Obama issued an Executive Order rescinding President Bush’s August 9, 2001 and June 20, 2007 Executive Orders. President Obama’s Executive Order also instructed the NIH to review existing guidance on human stem cell research and to issue new guidance on the use of hES cells in federally funded research, consistent with President’s new Executive Order and existing law. The NIH has adopted new guidelines that went into effect July 7, 2009. The central focus of the new guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. Those hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.
 
 31
 

In addition to President Obama’s Executive Order, a bipartisan bill has been introduced in the U.S. Senate that would allow Federal funding of hES research. The Senate bill is identical to one that was previously approved by both Houses of Congress but vetoed by President Bush. The Senate Bill provides that hES cells will be eligible for use in research conducted or supported by federal funding if the cells meet each of the following guidelines: (1) the stem cells were derived from human embryos that have been donated from IVF clinics, were created for the purposes of fertility treatment, and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment, (2) prior to the consideration of embryo donation and through consultation with the individuals seeking fertility treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded, and (3) the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with written informed consent and without receiving any financial or other inducements to make the donation. The Senate Bill authorizes the NIH to adopt further guidelines consistent with the legislation.
 
California State Regulations
 
The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Advance notice, but not approval by the SCRO Committee, is required in the case of in vitro research that does not derive new stem cell lines. Research that derives new stem cell lines or that involves fertilized human oocytes or blastocysts, or that involves clinical trials or the introduction of stem cells into humans, or that involves introducing stem cells into animals, requires advanced approval by the SCRO Committee. Clinical trials may also entail approvals from IRB at the medical center at which the study is conducted, and animal studies may require approval by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
 
All hES cell lines that will be used in our research must be acceptably derived. To be acceptably derived, the pluripotent stem cell line must have either:
 
 
● | Been listed on the National Institutes of Health Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Been deposited in the United Kingdom Stem Cell Bank; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Been derived by, or approved for use by, a licensee of the United Kingdom Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Been derived in accordance with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research under an application approved by the National Stem Cell Oversight Committee; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Been approved by CIRM in accordance with California Code of Regulation Title 17, Section 100081; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Been derived under the following conditions:
--+---------------------------------------------


(a) | Donors of gametes, embryos, somatic cells, or human tissue gave voluntary and informed consent,
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Donors of gametes, embryos, somatic cells, or human tissue did not receive valuable consideration. This provision does not prohibit reimbursement for permissible expenses as determined by an IRB,
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Donation of gametes, embryos, somatic cells, or human tissue was overseen by an IRB (or, in the case of foreign sources, an IRB equivalent), and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Individuals who consented to donate stored gametes, embryos, somatic cells, or human tissue were not reimbursed for the cost of storage prior to the decision to donate.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Other hES lines may be deemed acceptably derived if they were derived in accordance with (a), (b), and (d) above and the hES line was derived prior to the publication of the National Academy of Sciences guidelines on April 26, 2005 and a SCRO Committee has determined that the investigator has provided sufficient scientific rationale for the need for use of the line, which should include establishing that the proposed research cannot reasonably be carried out with covered lines that did have IRB approval.
 
 32
 

California regulations also require that certain records be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used, including:
 
 
● | A registry of all human stem cell research conducted, and the source(s) of funding for this research; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A registry of human pluripotent stem cell lines derived or imported, to include, but not necessarily limited to:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | The methods utilized to characterize and screen the materials for safety;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | The conditions under which the materials have been maintained and stored;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | A record of every gamete donation, somatic cell donation, embryo donation, or product of somatic cell nuclear transfer that has been donated, created, or used;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | A record of each review and approval conducted by the SCRO Committee.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
 
As a provider of laboratory testing on human specimens for the purpose of disease diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, OncoCyte will be required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct its business. In 1988, Congress enacted the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, (“CLIA”), which established quality standards for all laboratories providing testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. OncoCyte’s laboratory will need to obtain a CLIA certificate of accreditation and will be required to meet certain laboratory licensing and other requirements under laws of the states in which it operate or from which OncoCyte receives blood or urine samples for testing.
 
Under CLIA, a laboratory is defined as any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health of human beings. Under CLIA OncoCyte will be required to hold a certificate applicable to the complexity of the categories of testing performed and that OncoCyte comply with certain standards. CLIA further regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to be reimbursed for services provided to state and federal health care program beneficiaries. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs.
 
Under the CLIA, laboratory licensing requires a site inspection, review of standard operating procedures and verification that diagnostic results can be reproduced reliably across a number of different conditions. Before submitting for a license, extensive clinical testing, which is typically done in two phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of the test in diagnosing a specific condition. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an IRB that will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Clinical studies are generally conducted in two phases. The first phase is analytical validation which is done in the research laboratory and involves the replication of consistent results for the same sample across a spectrum of different conditions. Once the analytical validation is completed, the assay moves into clinical validation. In clinical validation tests are run to confirm that consistent results for the same sample can be obtained in the actual laboratory that will conduct the commercial tests.
 
OncoCyte will be subject to regular surveys and inspections to assess compliance with program standards. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests.
 
FDA Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
 
OncoCyte’s diagnostic tests will likely be classified as laboratory diagnostic tests (“LDTs”), and consequently be governed under the CLIA regulations, as administered by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), as well as by applicable state laws. Historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement restraint with respect to most LDTs and has not required laboratories that offer LDTs to comply with FDA requirements for medical devices, such as registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls. In recent years, however, the FDA has stated it intends to end its policy of enforcement restraint and begin regulating certain LDTs as medical devices. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)” and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)”, respectively, that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to modify its policy of enforcement restraint until the draft guidance documents are finalized. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the draft guidance documents will be finalized, and even then, the new regulatory requirements are proposed to be phased-in consistent with the schedule set forth in the guidance, which may happen in as little as 12 months after the draft guidance is finalized for certain high-priority LDTs. Nevertheless, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time.
 
 33
 

On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs (“Discussion Paper”), which follows the FDA’s late 2016 announcement that contrary to its earlier reports, it would not issue a final guidance on its proposed oversight of LDTs and allow for further public discussion on appropriate oversight. As it did in its 2014 guidance documents, the FDA continues to advocate a risk based approach to LDT oversight and proposes focusing on new and significantly modified high and moderate risk LDTs; however, new and significantly modified LDTs in certain categories would not be expected to comply with premarket review, quality systems, and registration and listing requirements unless necessary to protect public health. These exempt categories include low risk LDTs, LDTs for rare diseases, traditional LDTs, LDTs intended solely for public health surveillance, certain LDTs used in CLIA certified labs, and LDTs intended solely for forensic use. Based on the FDA’s guidance in the Discussion Paper, our products will likely not require FDA filing before launch. With respect to the postmarket surveillance of LDTs, the FDA’s Discussion Paper recommends that laboratories initially report serious adverse events for all tests except the exempted categories if tests, which include LDTs intended for public health surveillance, some stem cell/tissue/organ transplantation LDTs, and LDTs intended solely for forensic use. The Discussion Paper notes that while the report neither represents the formal position of the FDA and nor is it a final version of the LDT guidance documents published in 2014, it is hoped that its publication will continue to advance further public disclosure.
 
Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations, and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity. We cannot predict the ultimate form or impact of any such FDA guidance and the potential effect on our diagnostic test services.
 
We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for OncoCyte’s diagnostic tests, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that proposed legislation discussed above or other new legislation could be enacted into law, or new regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA. Such new legislation may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for OncoCyte to offer diagnostic tests or services.
 
If premarket review, including approval, is required, OncoCyte’s business could be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained. If OncoCyte is selling diagnostic tests when new FDA approval requirements are implemented, OncoCyte may be required to suspend sales until premarket clearance or approval is obtained. If OncoCyte’s diagnostic tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the legal status of those tests, if OncoCyte is required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows OncoCyte to make are limited, order levels for the use of OncoCyte tests may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected.
 
FDA regulations could also require, among other things, additional clinical studies and submission of a premarket notification or filing a Premarket Approval (“PMA”) application with the FDA. For example, LDTs with the same intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic are defined in FDA’s draft guidance as “high-risk LDTs (Class III medical devices)” for which premarket review would be required. This may include the use of LDTs for screening patients for cancer. See the discussion of FDA regulation of medical devices below under In Vitro Diagnostics. If premarket review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that OncoCyte’s diagnostic tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there any be assurance that labeling claims allowed by the FDA will be consistent with OncoCyte’s intended claims or will be adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for the tests.
 
California State Laboratory Licensing
 
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure will be required and maintained under California law for the San Francisco Bay Area based laboratory that OncoCyte plans to establish. Such laws include standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory.
 
OncoCyte will not be permitted to perform diagnostic tests at the California CLIA laboratory it plans to build, until the laboratory is certified by the state, and if after certification the laboratory falls out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Health Services (“DHS”) may suspend, restrict or revoke the license to operate the laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans.
 
 34
 

Other States’ Laboratory Licensing
 
Some states require licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states. OncoCyte’s laboratory will need to pass various state inspections in order to get licensed to provide LDTs in each of state that requires licensure. In addition to the inspection requirements of the other states, Pennsylvania, Florida and Maryland have laws that require a certificate of compliance, and New York has its own special inspection requirements that must be met, in order to market our diagnostics in those states or to perform diagnostic tests on specimens received from patients residing in those states.
In Vitro Diagnostics
 
In the future, OncoCyte may elect to develop IVDs, which are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. Medical devices marketed in the United States are subject to the regulatory controls under CLIA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and regulations adopted by the FDA. Some requirements, known as premarket requirements, apply to medical devices before they are marketed, and other requirements, known as post-market requirements, apply to medical devices after they are marketed.
 
The premarket requirements that must be met to market a medical device in the United States will depend on the classification of the device under FDA regulations. Medical devices are categorized into one of three classes, based on the degree of risk they present. Devices that pose the lowest risk are designated as Class I devices, devices that pose moderate risk are designated as Class II devices and are subject to general controls and special controls, and the devices that pose the highest risk are designated as Class III devices and are subject to general controls and premarket approval.
 
A premarket submission to the FDA will be required for some Class I devices, most Class II devices, and all Class III devices. Most Class I and some Class II devices are exempt from premarket submission requirements. Some Class I and most Class II devices may only be marketed after a 510(k) premarket notification, while a more extensive PMA or Premarket Approval is required to market Class III devices.
 
Until all regulatory requirements are phased in our initial confirmatory diagnostics will not require FDA filing before launch. Since the tests are being developed as LDTs, the regulatory pathway that OncoCyte will be following is the CLIA certification and inspection pathway. If the new requirements are phased in or if OncoCyte elects to develop IVDs, those future screenings diagnostics may require a 510(k) submission or a PMA. In a 510(k) submission, the device sponsor must demonstrate that the new device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device in terms of intended use, technological characteristics, and performance testing. A 510(k) requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another device that is legally marketed in the United States. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is at least as safe and effective as the predicate. A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it (a) has the same intended use as the predicate; and has the same technological characteristics as the predicate; or (b) has the same intended use as the predicate; and has different technological characteristics and the information submitted to FDA; does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness; and is demonstrated to be at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate device.

A claim of substantial equivalence does not mean the new and predicate devices must be identical. Substantial equivalence is established with respect to intended use, design, energy used or delivered, materials, chemical composition, manufacturing process, performance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, biocompatibility, standards, and other characteristics. A device may not be marketed in the United States until the submitter receives a letter declaring the device substantially equivalent. If the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent, the applicant may resubmit another 510(k) with new data, or request a Class I or II designation through the FDA’s de novo process that allows a new device without a valid predicate to be classified into Class I or II if it meets certain criteria, or file a reclassification petition, or submit a PMA.
 
A new 510(k) submission is required for changes or modifications to an existing approved device, where the modifications could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or the device is to be marketed for a new or different indication for use.
 
A PMA for Class III devices is the most stringent type of premarket submission. Before the FDA approves a PMA, the sponsor must provide valid scientific evidence demonstrating reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device’s intended use.

Submission of an application is no guarantee that the CMS or FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing or licensing, following the CMS or FDA’s review, the CMS or FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
 
CMS and the Office of Civil Rights issued a final rule in February 2014 to amend both the HIPAA and CLIA regulations. The final rule amended the HIPAA privacy rule to remove the CLIA laboratory exceptions, and as a result, HIPAA-covered laboratories are now required to provide individuals, upon request, with access to their completed test reports. Under the 2014 rules CLIA laboratories and CLIA-exempt laboratories may provide copies of a patient’s completed test reports that, using the laboratory’s authentication process, can be identified as belonging to that patient. These changes to the CLIA regulations and the HIPAA Privacy Rule provide individuals with a greater ability to access their health information, empowering them to take a more active role in managing their health and health care. CLIA laboratories must create and maintain policies, procedures, and other documentation necessary to inform patients of the right to access laboratory test reports and how to exercise that right.
 
The requirements under these regulations may periodically change and could have an effect on OncoCyte’s business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements. New laws governing privacy may also be adopted in the future. We can provide no assurance that OncoCyte will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which it does business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on OncoCyte‘s business.
 
Physician Referral Prohibitions
 
Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the Stark Law, there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on Medicare and Medicaid payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have a “financial relationship”—including an investment or ownership interest or a compensation arrangement—with the clinical laboratory performing the tests. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements, and (4) personal services arrangements that satisfy certain requirements. The laboratory cannot submit claims to the Medicare Part B program for services furnished in violation of the Stark Law, and Medicaid reimbursements may be at risk as well. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
 
A number of states, including California, do not allow business corporations to employ physicians to provide professional services. This prohibition against the “corporate practice of medicine” is aimed at preventing corporations such as OncoCyte from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians. The state licensure statutes and regulations and agency and court decisions that enumerate the specific corporate practice rules vary considerably from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. If regulatory authorities or other parties in any jurisdiction successfully assert that OncoCyte is engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine, OncoCyte could be required to restructure its contractual and other arrangements. In addition, violation of these laws may result in sanctions imposed against OncoCyte and/or the professional through licensure proceedings, and OncoCyte could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could result in exclusion from state and federal health care programs.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain requirements that, if met, will assure immunity from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued.
 
HIPAA also created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from federal health care programs.
 
Many states have laws similar to the federal laws described above and the state laws may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor.
 
Reimbursement
 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Similar Reimbursement Programs
 
Sales of the therapeutic products and diagnostic tests that we and our subsidiaries plan to offer will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of those products or tests will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. In the United States, the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that providers are required to pay to the state. Medicare for example, currently requires a 2% reduction to Medicare payment rates to providers due to federal budget cuts referred to as “sequestration”. In addition to government regulation, managed care organizations in the United States, which include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products. Managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies or diagnostic tests, they may not cover our products or diagnostic tests as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
Therapeutic Products: Third- Party Reimbursement
 
Sales of products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, continue to be focused on reducing the cost of healthcare. Their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges. Drugs, and in particular specialty drugs such as our products, remain a focus for cost containment by these parties. As a result, payers around the world are being more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. The scrutiny of biopharmaceutical pricing in the United States remains intense and a point of focus in the discussion of rising healthcare costs. The pricing practices of certain companies have increased public media and government scrutiny of the biopharmaceutical industry, providing greater incentive for governments and private payers to limit or regulate the price of drug products and services. At the same time, value assessments of new technology, previously used predominantly outside the United States, are having an impact in the U.S. healthcare environment. Healthcare provider organizations and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison with manufacturer pricing. Although these organizations do not set drug prices, they seek to influence pricing as well as payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessments, often making assertions around what they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for a product. These developments put greater pressure on access to, pricing of and sales of products.

In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, as well as through private payers. Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense. We may be required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products we sell to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and those rebates or discounts have increased over time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers. The new U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. On March 6, 2017, the American Health Care Act (“AHCA”) was introduced as the new administration’s proposed replacement of ACA. The timing and method of repeal of the ACA and adoption of the AHCA remains uncertain, but impending changes will likely impact the number of patient lives covered, the quality of the insurance, Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provided.
 
Further efforts by government agencies and state legislatures in the United States could also affect us and our industry. For example, a recently enacted Vermont law requires manufacturers to submit price increase justifications to the state attorney general if certain price increase and state spending thresholds are met. Examples of other proposals that have been discussed and debated, but not yet enacted, include state ballot initiatives that would place a maximum price ceiling, or cap, on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies and state legislative efforts to cap pharmaceutical prices for commercial payers. Other legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs, changes in the Federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for payment in Medicare or Medicaid; and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars, including the current Medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policies intended to encourage biosimilar adoption, or other policies that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantages.
 
In the U.S. private sector, healthcare providers and payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug spending altogether or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out of pocket costs and stricter utilization criteria before a patient may get access to a drug. In the retail pharmacy sector, the use of such measures by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and insurers has continued to intensify which have limited product usage and revenues industry wide. PBMs are third-party organizations tasked with administrating prescription drug programs for large employers, health plans and government programs. Consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States; for example, three PBMs oversee approximately 75% of covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments, and/or to mandate stricter utilization criteria. Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. Utilization management requirements continue to be onerous for patients and physicians, limiting access to appropriate usage. In highly competitive treatment markets PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position. A drug’s favorable position on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access.
 
We face similar issues outside of the United States. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
Diagnostic Tests: Third-Party Billing, Coverage, and Reimbursement
 
OncoCyte will face additional third-party reimbursement challenges for the diagnostic tests that it plans to provide. Revenues from OncoCyte’s clinical laboratory testing will be derived from several different sources. Depending on the billing arrangement, the instruction of the ordering physician and applicable law, parties that may reimburse OncoCyte for its services include:

● | Third-party payers that provide coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company, a managed care organization or a governmental payer program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physicians or other authorized parties, such as hospitals or independent laboratories, that order the testing service or otherwise refer the testing services to OncoCyte; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 38
 

 
● | Patients in cases where the patient has no insurance, has insurance that partially covers the testing, or owes a co-payment, co-insurance or deductible amount.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medicare
 
We expect that a substantial portion of the patients for whom OncoCyte may perform diagnostic tests will have Medicare as their primary medical insurance. We cannot assure that, without Medicare reimbursement OncoCyte’s planned tests will produce sufficient revenues to enable OncoCyte to reach profitability and achieve its other commercial objectives.
 
Clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are generally reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) and reimbursement under the Medicare program for the diagnostic tests that OncoCyte will offer is based on the CLFS.
 
Medicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither OncoCyte nor any other party, such as a reference laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service.
 
Legislative and Regulatory Changes Impacting Medicare Reimbursements
 
From time to time, Congress has revised the Medicare statute and the formulas it establishes for the CLFS. The payment amounts under the Medicare fee schedules are important because they not only will determine OncoCyte’s reimbursement under Medicare, but those payment amounts are also often used as a basis for payment amounts set by other governmental and private third-party payers. For example, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.
 
The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), enacted April 1, 2014 overhauls the CLFS payment methodology and imposes a market-based reimbursement system. PAMA provides that, in general payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (“CLDTs”) will be equal to the weighted median of private payer rates for the test, based on data reported by certain laboratories during a specified collection period. PAMA requires a similar rate adjustment and reporting requirement for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests (“ADLTs”). ADLTs are CDLTs furnished by a single laboratory, not sold for use by other entities, and meeting at least one of the following criteria:
 
 
● | Analysis of multiple biomarkers of DNA, RNA or proteins combined with a unique algorithm to yield a single patient-specific result;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cleared or approved by the FDA; or
--+-----------------------------------


● | Meets other similar criteria established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The tests OncoCyte will offer will most likely be classified as CDLTs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------



On June 23, 2016, the CLFS final rule entitled “Medicare Program: Medicare Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Test Payment System” (“Final Rule”) set out the details of the payment policy mandated by PAMA and set an effective date of January 1, 2018 for the shift in payment rates. PAMA and the Final Rule will significantly impact the way that laboratory tests are reimbursed by Medicare. CMS estimates that the Final Rule will result in a reduction of approximately $390 million, or 5.6%, in Medicare spending on clinical laboratory tests in federal fiscal year 2018 and nearly $4 billion over the course of 10 years.
 
Beginning January 1, 2017, Medicare payment for any new ADLT will be based on the list price or charge. After the test is commercially available for three quarters, the laboratory will be required to report payment and volume information and this data will be used to set payment for the test for the following year.
 
 
● | If data shows that the list price was greater than 130% of the payment using established methodology, generally a weighted median, CMS will recoup the difference from the laboratory through a payment claw back.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payment will be updated annually based on the weighted median of commercial payer reimbursement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Congress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance charge on patients for CLDTs reimbursed under the CLFS, which would require OncoCyte to bill patients for these amounts. Because of the relatively low reimbursement for many CLDTs, in the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for these services would often exceed the amount actually received from the patient and effectively increase OncoCyte’s costs of billing and collecting.

Some Medicare claims may be subject to policies issued by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (“MAC”) for California. CMS relies on a network of MACs to process Medicare claims, and MACs serve as the primary operational contact between the Medicare Fee-For-Service program and approximately 1.5 million health care providers enrolled in the program. The predecessor to the current California MAC, acting on behalf of many MACs, issued a Local Coverage Determination that affects coverage, coding and billing of many molecular diagnostic tests. Under this Local Coverage Determination, the MAC took the position that it would not cover any molecular diagnostic test unless the test is expressly included in a National Coverage Determination issued by CMS, or a Local Coverage Determination, or coverage article issued by the MAC. Denial of coverage for our diagnostic tests by the current California MAC, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, or reimbursement at inadequate levels, would have a material adverse impact on our business and on market acceptance of OncoCyte's planned diagnostic tests.
 
Private and Governmental Third Party Payers
 
Where there is a private or governmental third-party payer coverage policy in place, OncoCyte will bill the payer and the patient in accordance with the established policy. Where there is no coverage policy in place, OncoCyte will pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. OncoCyte’s efforts in obtaining reimbursement based on individual claims, including pursuing appeals or reconsiderations of claims denials, could take a substantial amount of time, and bills may not be paid for many months, if at all. Furthermore, if a third-party payer denies coverage after final appeal, OncoCyte may not receive payment at all.
 
Reimbursement rates paid by private third-party payers can vary based on whether the provider is an “in-network” provider, a participating provider, a covered provider, an “out-of-network” provider or a non-participating provider. These definitions can vary among payers. An in-network provider usually has a contract with the payor or benefits provider. This contract governs, among other things, service-level agreements and reimbursement rates. In certain instances, an insurance company may negotiate an in-network rate for OncoCyte’s testing. An in-network provider may have rates that are lower per test than those that are out-of-network, and that rate can vary widely. Rates vary based on the payor, the testing type and often the specifics of the patient’s insurance plan. If a laboratory agrees to contract as an in-network provider, it generally expects to receive quicker payment and access to additional covered patients. However, it is likely that OncoCyte will initially be considered an “out-of-network” or non-participating provider by payers who cover the vast majority of patients until such time that OncoCyte can negotiate contracts with these payers.
 
We cannot predict whether, or under what circumstances, payers will reimburse for all components of OncoCyte’s tests. Full or partial denial of coverage by payers, or reimbursement at inadequate levels, would have a material adverse impact on OncoCyte’s business and on market acceptance of OncoCyte’s diagnostic tests.
 
Direct Billing Laws and Other State Law Restrictions on Billing for Laboratory Services
 
Laws and regulations in certain states prohibit laboratories from billing physicians or other purchasers for testing that they order. Some states may allow laboratories to bill physicians directly but may prohibit the physician and, in some cases, other purchasers from charging more than the purchase price for the services, or may allow only for the recovery of acquisition costs, or may require disclosure of certain information on the invoice. In some cases, and if not prohibited by law or regulation, OncoCyte may bill physicians, hospitals and other laboratories directly for the services that they order. An increase in the number of states that impose similar restrictions could adversely affect OncoCyte by encouraging physicians to perform laboratory services in-house or by causing physicians to refer services to other laboratories that are not subject to the same restrictions.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed one hundred two employees (102), of which forty (40) are BioTime employees and sixty-two are employees of our subsidiaries (including OncoCyte and excluding Asterias), and one hundred (100) are on a full-time basis and two (2) persons on a part-time basis. Twenty-six (26) full-time employees hold Ph.D. degrees in one or more fields of science. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
