 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic product for the acute treatment of migraine. Our product candidate, STS101, is a drug-device combination of a proprietary dry-powder formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate, or DHE, which can be quickly and easily self-administered with a proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device. DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine and have significant advantages over other therapeutics for many patients. However, broad use has been limited by invasive and burdensome administration and/or sub-optimal clinical performance of available injectable and liquid nasal spray products. STS101 is specifically designed to deliver the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming these shortcomings. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in 42 healthy volunteers, in which STS101 demonstrated rapid and sustained DHE plasma concentrations, low pharmacokinetic variability, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In July 2019, we initiated our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial of STS101 and expect to report topline data in the second half of 2020.
 Migraine is a chronic and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by attacks of often severe headache and accompanying neurological symptoms lasting four to 72 hours. More than 90% of individuals suffering from migraine attacks are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Failure to effectively treat migraine attacks can lead to disease progression, increased frequency of attacks and greater migraine-related disability.
 Based on reported prevalence data, approximately 39 million individuals in the United States and over 100 million individuals in Europe suffer from migraine. Migraine is most prevalent among adults ages 18 to 44 and disproportionately affects women over men on a three-to-one basis. With a global prevalence of greater than one billion, migraine ranks as the world’s third most prevalent illness, the sixth highest specific cause of disability worldwide, and the leading cause of disability in people under 50 years of age. In addition, migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide in terms of number of years lost to disability. It has been estimated that migraine results in up to $36 billion in healthcare and lost productivity costs and up to 157 million lost workdays annually in the United States. Despite its high prevalence and burden, migraine remains a highly underdiagnosed and undertreated illness due to lack of awareness, stigma and the inherent limitations of currently available therapies.
 Acute treatments are categorized as non-specific therapies, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, and migraine-specific therapies, such as triptans and ergot alkaloids (including DHE-based products). In addition, two new migraine-specific acute treatments were approved in late 2019 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): lasmiditan, an oral 5HT1F agonist; and ubrogepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist. In 2018, more than 15 million prescriptions for migraine-specific acute therapies were written in the United States. This figure excludes prescriptions for non-specific therapies and therefore likely significantly understates the total number of prescriptions written for the acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans are currently the predominant class of drug for acute treatment of migraine, accounting for over 90% of migraine-specific acute therapy prescriptions. However, triptans have been reported to have a number of shortcomings, including that they have inconsistent efficacy across patients and migraine types, require early treatment, cause various side effects, may cause medication overuse headache, or MOH, and have slow and variable onset of action and short duration of effect that necessitates retreatment. DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine and have significant clinical advantages over other therapeutics, including triptans, for many patients. However, approved DHE products have drawbacks that have resulted in limited clinical use. For instance, injectable DHE, while effective, has invasive administration requirements, and in the case of intravenous (IV) delivery, generally must be administered by a healthcare provider, typically in the hospital or clinic setting, requires specialized equipment and may often result in side effects, in 
 1


particular, nausea and vomiting. Similarly, intramuscular (IM) and or subcutaneous (SC) injections are invasive, require administration via injection by the patient, caregiver or healthcare provider and patients typically prefer non-injectable therapies. In addition, DHE liquid nasal sprays have complex, time-consuming and burdensome administration, as well as high variability and slow absorption that may result in inconsistent and sub-optimal clinical performance. Further, due to DHE’s low oral bioavailability, there are no approved oral DHE products in the United States.
 STS101 was designed to be a reliable and convenient DHE product capable of delivering the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming the shortcomings of existing DHE products. STS101 has a number of key attributes that we believe may provide significant advantages over existing acute treatments for migraine and result in robust and consistent clinical performance and thereby facilitate broad adoption and use. These attributes are primarily the result of our proprietary dry-powder formulation, which incorporates a mucoadhesive drug carrier and engineered drug particle technologies, and our proprietary nasal delivery device. Key STS101 attributes include:
  
• | Targeted plasma concentrations rapidly achieved and sustained. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, administration of STS101 resulted in achievement within 10 minutes of a mean DHE plasma concentration of 1.0 ng/ml, which we estimate is the minimum threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE. In addition, DHE exposure (plasma concentration over time expressed as area-under-curve) following STS101 administration at all times exceeded that for Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray 2.0 mg, which is the only DHE product marketed in the United States that has been approved by the FDA based upon demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical studies. Further, DHE exposure following STS101 administration was similar to or greater than DHE exposures reported with DHE mesylate IM injection, which is marketed in the United States but has not been approved by the FDA based on demonstration of efficacy, and DHE administered via pulmonary inhalation (MAP0004), which met all four of its primary efficacy endpoints in a large Phase 3 clinical trial, but was later discontinued and has not been approved by the FDA. For instance, although peak DHE plasma concentration following administration of STS101 5.2 mg did not reach peak concentration levels associated with IV or IM delivery of DHE, DHE exposure was approximately 83% of that achieved with a DHE mesylate IM injection in our Phase 1 clinical trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low variability. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, STS101 demonstrated significantly lower variability in peak DHE plasma concentration and DHE exposure as compared to Migranal® DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray, which may lead to more reliable clinical performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quick and convenient self-administration. STS101 utilizes a convenient, patient-friendly, single-use, nasal delivery device designed to enable self-administration of a full dose of DHE into a single nostril in a matter of seconds.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well tolerated. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, all treatments were well tolerated, all adverse events were mild and transient, and no subject withdrew from the trial due to an adverse event. Moreover, STS101 did not exhibit the rapid and high peak concentration associated with IV delivery of DHE, which may often result in side effects, in particular, nausea and vomiting.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the foregoing attributes of STS101 could lead to it having a favorable therapeutic response profile as compared to IV, IM or SC delivery of DHE and Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray. The faster a DHE product can produce the threshold DHE plasma concentration necessary for a therapeutic response, the more quickly following administration it may be able to achieve a therapeutic response. At the same time, we believe that rapid and high peak DHE plasma concentrations that greatly exceed the threshold therapeutic level may result in adverse side effects. For example, IV delivery of DHE has demonstrated peak DHE plasma concentrations of 50 ng/ml or more within several minutes of administration, and is reported to more frequently result in side effects (including nausea and vomiting, increases in blood pressure, flushing, dizziness, extremity pain, and abnormal skin sensations) than delivery of DHE by other routes of administration, such as IM or SC injection, nasal or pulmonary, which exhibit much lower peak DHE plasma concentrations that generally have not been reported to exceed approximately 3 to 4 ng/ml. Based on published DHE PK and clinical efficacy trial data relating to DHE plasma concentrations and clinical efficacy and safety data of different DHE doses, we estimate that 1.0 ng/ml is the threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE. As demonstrated in Part 2 of our Phase 1 clinical trial, administration of STS101 5.2 mg and DHE mesylate IM injection resulted in DHE plasma concentrations rising rapidly, with mean concentrations exceeding 1.0 ng/ml at 10 minutes and 5 minutes after dosing, respectively. While, STS101’s peak DHE plasma concentration (approximately 2.2 ng/ml) did not exceed the peak DHE plasma concentration of DHE mesylate IM injection (approximately 3.3 ng/ml), DHE exposure following administration of STS101 5.2 mg was 
 2


approximately 83% of that achieved with a DHE mesylate IM injection. In contrast, the mean maximum DHE plasma concentration after Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray administration did not reach 1.0 ng/ml.
 While subjects treated with STS101 5.2 mg reported a higher frequency of nasal adverse events than those treated with DHE mesylate IM injection or Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray, all adverse events were mild and transient, and subjective nasal symptom severity scores self-reported by subjects were very low, with all nasal symptom severity scores averaging less than five on a zero to one hundred scale in which zero represents absence of the symptom and one hundred represents presence of the symptom with the worst imaginable severity. Subjective nasal symptom severity scores self-reported in Part 1 of our Phase 1 clinical trial by subjects treated with STS101 1.3 mg and 2.6 mg were negligible. As a result, we do not believe the tolerability of STS101 should present a barrier to patient adoption or use, if approved.
 In July 2019, we initiated our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial of STS101, a multi-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in approximately 1,140 migraine patients, and we expect to report topline data in the second half of 2020. In our EMERGE trial, STS101 will be self-administered by patients to treat a single migraine attack and the two co-primary endpoints to be assessed at two hours after STS101 administration are freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom. In addition, we expect to prospectively evaluate a number of secondary endpoints and the performance of STS101 in a number of patient subgroups that could enhance the differentiated clinical profile of STS101. After the completion of our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial, we plan to initiate a 12-month safety trial of STS101, with a new drug application, or NDA, filing with the FDA, anticipated by the end of 2021.
 Our management team has extensive pharmaceutical industry experience in drug development, regulatory approval, manufacturing, reimbursement, commercialization and finance from their prior roles at other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ALZA, AstraZeneca, Athena Neurosciences, Elan Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, Ilypsa, Immunex, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson, Pearl Therapeutics, Protagonist Therapeutics, Relypsa, Roivant Sciences, and Wyeth Laboratories. Collectively, our management team has materially contributed to the clinical development, registration and/or commercialization of over 50 approved drug products, including 15 drug-device combination products, 13 of which are delivered via inhalation.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize STS101 and address the significant unmet medical needs of a large number of people with migraine. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Advance STS101 through clinical development and regulatory approval for the acute treatment of migraine. In July 2019, we initiated our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial, with a target enrollment of 1,140 patients. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2020. We expect to commence a 12-month safety trial in the third quarter of 2020, with an NDA filing anticipated by the end of 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize STS101 in the United States. If approved, we plan to commercialize STS101 in the United States by building a specialized sales organization focusing on headache specialists, as well as general neurologists and primary care physicians who are high prescribers of migraine therapeutics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue market opportunities for STS101 outside the United States with one or more partners. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for STS101 in markets outside the United States. To address these markets, we plan to seek one or more ex-U.S. partners who can commercialize STS101.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize commercial potential of STS101. We may conduct additional clinical trials and consider additional headache indications for STS101 to maximize its commercial potential.

Migraine Overview
 Migraine is a chronic and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by attacks of often severe headache and accompanying neurological symptoms lasting four to 72 hours. More than 90% of individuals suffering from migraine are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Failure to effectively treat migraine attacks can lead to disease progression, increased frequency of attacks and greater migraine-related disability. Migraine is often accompanied by one or more of the following disabling symptoms:

• | extreme sensitivity to light, sound, touch or smell;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | nausea and/or vomiting;
--+------------------------


• | dizziness;
--+-----------


• | visual disturbances;
--+---------------------


• | tingling or numbness in the extremities or face; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | neck pain.
--+-----------

 Based on reported prevalence data, approximately 39 million individuals in the United States and over 100 million individuals in Europe suffer from migraine. Migraine is most prevalent among adults ages 18 to 44 and disproportionately affects women over men on a three-to-one basis. With a global prevalence of greater than one billion, migraine ranks as the world’s third most prevalent illness, the sixth highest specific cause of disability worldwide, and the leading cause of disability in people under 50 years of age. In addition, migraine is the second leading cause of disability in terms of number of patient-years lost to disability. It has been estimated that migraine results in up to $36 billion in healthcare and lost productivity costs and up to 157 million lost workdays annually in the United States. In 2018, more than 15 million prescriptions for migraine-specific acute therapies were written in the United States. This figure excludes prescriptions for non-specific therapies, such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and therefore likely significantly understates the total number of prescriptions written for the acute treatment of migraine.
 The underlying causes of migraine are not well understood; however, both genetics and environmental factors appear to be relevant. Further, the underlying biology of migraine is complex and multifactorial, and it is believed that migraine susceptibility arises from genetic predisposition to generalized neuronal hyperexcitability. During a migraine attack, hyperexcitable neurons cause the release of various vasoactive, pro-inflammatory and neuroactive substances, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, histamine, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and serotonin, leading to vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation and neurological symptoms, including headache and pain.
 Migraine treatment can generally be categorized as either acute or preventive. Treatment guidelines indicate that all patients should be offered acute treatment, which is focused on stopping the migraine attack quickly and restoring the patient’s ability to function with minimal side effects. In addition to receiving acute treatments, a subset of patients (typically those with more severe and/or frequent migraine attacks) may also receive preventive treatment, which is focused on reducing the frequency, duration or severity of migraine attacks or the associated disability caused by such attacks. Historically, preventive therapies, such as anti-convulsants, beta blockers and onabotulinumtoxinA injections, have lacked strong efficacy for many patients, have been associated with significant side effects or required burdensome administration. The recent introduction of anti-CGRP antibodies as a new class of preventive therapy is raising awareness of the treatment opportunities in migraine and may lead to an increase in the number patients being diagnosed and treated for migraine. However, these new therapies do not alleviate the need for acute therapies, as such products on average result in patients experiencing a reduction of only two migraine days per month. Despite its high prevalence and burden, migraine remains a highly underdiagnosed and undertreated illness due to lack of awareness, stigma and the inherent limitations of currently available therapies.

Current Acute Treatment Paradigm
 Patients typically seek acute treatment for migraine to relieve pain and associated symptoms. The current treatment guidelines from the American Headache Society define the five goals of acute therapy as:

• | Rapid and consistent freedom from pain and associated symptoms without recurrence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restored ability to function;
--+------------------------------


• | Minimal need for repeat dosing or rescue medications;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimal self-care and reduced subsequent use of resources (e.g., emergency room visits, diagnostic imaging, healthcare provider and ambulatory infusion center visits); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimal or no side effects.
--+----------------------------

 Acute treatments are typically administered orally, via injection or nasally. Orally-administered acute treatments have significant limitations, including relatively slow onset of effect due to the time required for absorption of the drug from the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion. During a migraine attack, absorption of orally-administered treatments can be delayed due to gastric stasis, which commonly occurs in people with migraine both during and between attacks. In addition, orally-administered acute treatments are inappropriate for the many migraine patients who experience significant nausea or vomiting with their attacks or who have trouble swallowing orally-administered medications. Injectable therapies, while often offering the fastest means of achieving therapeutic blood levels of the administered drug product, often require the involvement of a healthcare provider, can be difficult to self-administer and typically result in greater side effects than non-injectable therapies. As a result, patients generally prefer non-injectable therapies over injectable therapies. While nasal administration of acute treatments has the potential to address certain of these limitations by facilitating rapid absorption of drug from the linings of the nasal passages into the bloodstream while simultaneously limiting side effects, currently available and development-stage nasally-administered acute treatments have drawbacks and limitations. These drawbacks and limitations may include one or more of the following:
  
• | Efficacy that is comparable or only incrementally better than orally-administered acute treatments;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partial or variable absorption in the nose, with the remaining fraction of drug delivered into the nasal passage, running down the back of the throat, being swallowed and subsequently absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Variable pharmacokinetics (PK), resulting in inconsistent and sub-optimal clinical performance and perceived lack of reliability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For liquid nasal spray formulations, the administered drug product often drips out of the nose and runs-off down the back of throat, which can result in unpleasant taste;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-intuitive and cumbersome administration procedures, including the need for assembly, priming and multiple administrations (sprays or insufflations) over time in order to deliver a full dose. For example, this is the case with Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray, for which the self-administration procedure requires four sprays, one in each nostril initially, followed by an additional spray in each nostril 15 minutes later, to administer a full dose; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large size, which reduces practicality of transport for patients and ability to discreetly self-administer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Acute treatments are categorized as non-specific therapies, including NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and migraine-specific therapies, such as triptans and ergot alkaloids (including DHE-based products), as well as oral CGRP antagonist and oral 5HT1F antagonist products recently approved by the FDA. Non-specific therapies are generally recommended for the acute treatment of migraine with mild to moderate pain, and migraine-specific therapies are generally recommended for the acute treatment of migraine with moderate to severe pain. However, none of the currently available treatment options adequately achieve the acute treatment goals for a significant percentage of migraine patients.
 5


Triptans
 Oral triptans are currently the predominant class of drug for acute treatment of migraine, accounting for over 90% of migraine-specific acute therapy prescriptions, or more than 14 million prescriptions in the United States in 2018. Triptans are serotonergic agonists, typically with selective activity on a limited number of serotonergic receptors, including the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. While widely prescribed, triptans have been reported to have low treatment persistence, with up to 66% of patients never refilling their initial triptan prescriptions. A substantial majority of patients who discontinue triptans cite a lack of efficacy and side effects as the reasons for discontinuation. Triptans have been reported to have a number of shortcomings, including the following:

• | Inconsistent and sub-optimal efficacy. Approximately 40% of migraine patients do not respond to oral triptan therapy (assessed based on pain relief at two hours from the administration of treatment) and up to 80% do not achieve sustained freedom from pain. In addition, triptans have been reported to have poor effectiveness in multiple common migraine types, including migraine with allodynia (painful touch), migraine with aura (visual or olfactory disturbance), prolonged migraine, menstrual-related migraine, migraine with multiple recurrences, severe migraine, and migraine upon awakening.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Side effects and medication overuse headache. Triptans may produce unpleasant “triptan sensation” side effects, including tightening of the throat, chest, neck and limbs with paresthesias, or tingling, and hot or cold sensations. In addition, triptans have the potential to cause MOH, which can require inpatient detoxification and significantly complicate migraine management. As a result, triptans carry a label warning against use on 10 or more days per month.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requirement for early treatments. While triptans have been shown to be more effective when taken early in the course a migraine attack, the opportunity for early treatment has been estimated to exist in only 50% of all migraine attacks. Moreover, migraine patients often wait to treat following the onset of a migraine attack due to uncertainty with respect to the peak severity of a particular migraine attack, concern over side effects or dosing limitations, or inability to treat early (for instance, in cases of migraine upon awakening). In one published study, 79% of patients experienced freedom from pain when attacks were treated within one hour of pain onset, but only 21% experienced freedom from pain when attacks were treated four hours after the onset of pain. As a result, many patients may not fully benefit from triptan therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Slow and variable onset of action and short duration of effect. With oral and nasal triptan therapies, the onset of pain relief tends to be relatively slow and variable due to inconsistent systemic absorption via oral and nasal routes of administration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recurrence within 24 hours. Migraine recurrence within 24 hours occurs in up to 45% of attacks treated with triptans, resulting in the need for rescue medication and/or re-treatment. Published studies have reported that recurrence of migraine, or the recurrence within 24 hours of an effectively treated migraine, is a common reason given for dissatisfaction among people with migraine and is reported to be a significant unmet need with current acute treatments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DHE
 DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine. DHE has broader pharmacological activity than triptans across multiple receptor types, including serotonergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, represses CGRP release, and is thought to inhibit neuroinflammation and central sensitization via adrenergic receptors. In addition, DHE has a long pharmacodynamic half-life thought to be attributed to slow receptor dissociation. Because of its differentiated clinical attributes, many headache specialists consider DHE to be a preferred treatment for many difficult-to-treat migraine types, including severe migraine, migraine with allodynia, migraine upon awakening, fast onset migraine, prolonged and recurrent migraine attacks, including menstrual-related migraine, and migraine attacks requiring late treatment (i.e., more than one hour after onset of attack). In addition, DHE is considered a standard-of-care treatment for MOH and for status migrainosus, which is a condition characterized by debilitating migraine attacks that last more than 72 hours. Given the complexity of migraine biology and the redundancy and interdependence of migraine disease pathways, DHE’s activity across multiple receptors is thought to offer the potential for better responses for many migraine patients.
 6


DHE has a number of differentiating clinical attributes providing advantages for the acute treatment of migraine, including:
  
• | Effective in patients who are non-responsive or refractory to triptan therapy. Published data indicate that approximately half of all patients who have previously failed to adequately respond to triptan therapy, do respond to DHE therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in migraine attacks with allodynia. Allodynia is present in up to two-thirds of migraine attacks, and its presence is associated with poor response to triptans and most other acute treatments. DHE, however, has demonstrated strong efficacy in migraine attacks in which allodynia is present.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective irrespective of when administered during the time course of a migraine attack. Unlike triptans and certain other acute treatments for migraine, which are most effective when administered within one hour of onset of pain, DHE remains effective when administered late after onset of attack.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low risk of headache recurrence. DHE has been demonstrated in head-to-head controlled studies to have significantly lower headache recurrence rates than available triptan therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower risk of causing MOH. DHE is thought to have a lower potential for causing MOH with frequent use and, unlike triptan class therapies, currently approved DHE products do not contain a label warning for MOH potential.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on published DHE PK and clinical trial data relating to DHE plasma concentrations and clinical efficacy of different DHE doses, we estimate that 1.0 ng/ml is the threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE. Due to its chemical properties and structure, DHE has low bioavailability (approximately 1%) when administered orally and, as a result, oral forms have generally not been effective for the acute treatment of migraine. There are currently no approved oral DHE treatments in the United States. Approved DHE products include injectable and liquid nasal spray dosage forms, which have drawbacks that have resulted in limited clinical use.
 Due to DHE’s vasoconstrictive effects, DHE products are not recommended for use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, approved DHE products carry a “black box” warning in their labels for a risk that the coadministration of DHE and certain other drugs, including specific antivirals and antibiotics, may result in elevated levels of DHE in the blood, potentially causing vasospasm that may result in inadequate blood flow to the extremities or the brain. Unless we can successfully demonstrate by conducting a drug-drug interaction study that the coadministration of DHE and certain other drugs does not result in inhibition of DHE metabolism and elevated DHE levels, the FDA is likely to require the label for STS101, if approved, to include such warning, and this could result in STS101 not achieving its full commercial potential.
 Injectable DHE
 IV delivery is the fastest means of achieving plasma concentration levels of DHE that we estimate to be necessary to effectively treat a migraine attack, with anti-migraine responses reported as quickly as 15-20 minutes following administration. IV-delivered DHE is typically administered by a healthcare provider in a hospital, clinic or infusion center setting, which is expensive and requires the patient to travel to one of these locations while suffering from a migraine attack. Because IV delivery of DHE results in rapid achievement of high DHE blood levels, side effects are more common with IV administration than with other routes of administration, with nausea and vomiting being particularly common and typically requiring coadministration of anti-nausea medication. DHE can also be administered by IM or SC injection. However, IM and SC administration require a patient, caregiver or healthcare provider to use proper technique during a migraine attack to draw the correct dose of DHE solution for injection from a vial or glass ampule into a syringe and then inject the solution into the muscle or subcutaneous layer of the skin. Although generally considered effective, the challenges of injectable DHE and the fact that migraine patients typically prefer non-injectable therapies for acute treatment of attacks make injectable DHE a less favored treatment option for many people with migraine.

DHE Liquid Nasal Spray
 DHE may also be delivered via liquid nasal spray. However, Migranal, the only FDA-approved DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray product, and development-stage DHE liquid nasal spray products may have a number of limitations and complexities related to their liquid nasal spray formulation and delivery devices, including the following:

• | High variability and slow absorption. The required administration of DHE via multiple liquid nasal sprays often results in highly variable delivered doses of DHE and highly variable DHE plasma concentrations. Moreover, absorption of DHE following administration of Migranal is relatively low and slow in comparison with injectable DHE products, and often fails to achieve plasma concentration levels of DHE of at least 1.0 ng/ml, which we estimate is the minimum threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE. For example, in our Phase 1 clinical trial, 65% of subjects receiving Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray administration did not achieve 1.0 ng/ml at any time following administration. The low, slow, and highly variable DHE plasma levels achieved with Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray administration can result in inconsistent and unreliable clinical performance and sub-optimal therapeutic response for many patients. This may be evidenced by the fact that in only one of the four pivotal efficacy studies described in the U.S. prescribing information for Migranal, did Migranal demonstrate a statistically significant effect on migraine pain at 2 hours post-dose. Moreover, this statistically significant effect was on the endpoint of migraine pain relief (i.e., reduction in pain) at two hours post-dose, which is generally considered a lower hurdle to achieve than the current FDA-accepted co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom at two hours post-dose.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complex and burdensome administration. The administration of DHE liquid nasal spray typically requires a complex and burdensome multi-step process, including the opening of the glass vial containing the nasal liquid spray solution and the assembly and priming of a nasal spray device. Due to the low aqueous solubility of DHE, an adequate dosage of DHE via liquid nasal spray requires multiple sprays. For example, Migranal requires four sprays, one in each nostril initially, followed by an additional spray in each nostril 15 minutes later, to administer a full dose. Following administration, liquid can drip out of the nose and run-off down the back of throat, which can result in bad taste.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconvenient packaging and degradation potential. Formulations of DHE liquid nasal spray are sensitive to heat, light and oxygen, which necessitates packaging in a sealed, amber-colored, glass vial that cannot be stored in warm environments. In addition, any unused DHE liquid nasal spray remaining after eight hours since the opening of a DHE glass vial must be discarded.

 Headache specialists articulate a need for a patient-friendly, self-administered, non-injected DHE product that consistently and reliably provides the rapid, durable and robust efficacy that is currently available only with injectable DHE therapies. Given the differentiated clinical features of DHE, we believe DHE, if made available in a non-injectable dosage form that is well tolerated, facilitates quick and convenient administration and delivers rapid and sustained achievement of therapeutic concentrations with low variability, could provide significant benefits over existing acute treatments for migraine and help a large number of people with migraine better achieve migraine treatment goals.
 Our Solution: STS101 for the Acute Treatment of Migraine
 STS101 is a drug-device combination of a proprietary dry-powder formulation of DHE administered by a proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device. STS101 is specifically designed to deliver the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming the shortcomings that have limited the utility of DHE for the acute treatment of migraine. The proprietary and foundational dry-powder formulation and nasal delivery device technologies incorporated in STS101 were developed over more than 15 years by a dedicated team at Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd., or SNBL.

Subsequent to licensing such technology from SNBL, we advanced the development of STS101 by developing and optimizing the STS101 formulation, establishing analytical methods and scalable manufacturing performed in accordance with good manufacturing practices, conducting extensive analytical characterization of STS101 and its components, and completing toxicology studies in accordance with good laboratory practices. The manufacturing processes we established employ standard technologies that are commonly utilized in the pharmaceutical industry for the manufacture of approved drug and drug-device combination products and that we believe will be reproducible on commercial-scale equipment. Furthermore, we have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in 42 healthy volunteers and a preliminary human factors study that we believe validates the STS101 instructions for use that are being utilized in the EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial, and we have obtained written feedback from the FDA on various aspects of our STS101 Phase 3 development program, including the protocol for our EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial, which we initiated in July 2019. Following our Phase 3 efficacy trial, we expect to commence a 12-month safety trial in the third quarter of 2020, with an NDA filing anticipated by the end of 2021.
 

STS101 was designed to be a rapidly-acting, reliable, and convenient DHE therapeutic product. It has a number of key attributes that we believe may provide significant advantages over existing acute treatments for migraine and result in robust and consistent clinical performance and thereby facilitate broad adoption and use. These attributes are primarily the result of our proprietary dry-powder formulation, which incorporates a mucoadhesive drug carrier and engineered drug particle technologies, and our proprietary nasal delivery device. Key STS101 attributes include:
  
• | Targeted plasma concentrations rapidly achieved and sustained. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, administration of STS101 resulted in achievement within 10 minutes of a mean DHE plasma concentration of 1.0 ng/ml, which we estimate is the minimum threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE. In addition, DHE exposure (plasma concentration over time expressed as area-under-curve) following STS101 administration at all times exceeded that for Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray 2.0 mg, which is the only DHE product marketed in the United States that has been approved by the FDA based upon demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical studies. Further, DHE exposure following STS101 administration was similar to or greater than DHE exposures reported with DHE mesylate IM injection, which is marketed in the United States, which was based upon demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical studies, and DHE administered via pulmonary inhalation (MAP0004), which met all four of its primary efficacy endpoints in a large Phase 3 clinical trial, but was later discontinued and has not been approved by the FDA. For instance, although peak DHE plasma concentration following administration of STS101 5.2 mg did not reach peak concentration levels associated with IV or IM delivery of DHE, DHE exposure was approximately 83% of that achieved with a DHE mesylate IM injection in our Phase 1 clinical trial.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low variability. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, STS101 demonstrated significantly lower variability in peak DHE plasma concentration and DHE exposure as compared to Migranal, which may lead to more reliable clinical performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Quick and convenient self-administration. STS101 utilizes a convenient, patient-friendly, single-use, nasal delivery device designed to enable self-administration of a full dose of DHE into a single nostril in a matter of seconds. The pre-filled device is pocket-sized and more compact than available DHE liquid nasal spray products, enabling portability and discreet use, and requires no assembly or priming. In addition, the STS101 dry-powder formulation has demonstrated favorable stability properties (including, insensitivity to light, heat or oxygen) we expect will enable storage across a wide range of temperatures and conditions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well tolerated. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, all treatments were well tolerated, all adverse events were mild and transient, and no subject withdrew from the trial for an adverse event. Moreover, STS101 did not exhibit the rapid and high peak concentration associated with IV delivery of DHE, which may often result in side effects, in particular nausea and vomiting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the foregoing attributes of STS101 could lead to it having a favorable therapeutic response profile as compared to IV, IM or SC delivery of DHE and Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray. The faster a DHE product can produce the threshold DHE plasma concentration necessary for a therapeutic response, the more quickly following administration it may be able to achieve a therapeutic response. At the same time, we believe that rapid and high peak DHE plasma concentrations that greatly exceed the threshold therapeutic level may result in adverse side effects. For example, IV delivery of DHE has demonstrated peak DHE plasma concentrations of 50 ng/ml or more within several minutes of administration, and is reported to more frequently result in side effects (including nausea and vomiting, increases in blood pressure, flushing, dizziness, extremity pain, and abnormal skin sensations) than delivery of DHE by other routes of administration, such as IM or SC injection, nasal or pulmonary, which exhibit much lower peak DHE plasma concentrations that generally have not been reported to exceed approximately 3 to 4 ng/ml. Based on published DHE PK and clinical efficacy trial data relating to DHE plasma concentrations and clinical efficacy and safety data of different DHE doses, we estimate that 1.0 ng/ml is the threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE.
 The STS101 administration procedure is shown in the figure below:
 

Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic and Safety Trial Results
 We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of STS101, which demonstrated favorable PK, safety and tolerability, and which established the doses of STS101 to be evaluated in our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial. Our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluated STS101 in 42 healthy volunteers in a single-center, single-dose, open-label, 2-part, 3-period crossover, PK and safety trial. As reflected in the figure below, in Part 1 of the trial, 15 subjects each received three ascending doses of STS101 per a 3-period crossover design. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in each dose of STS101 is DHE and, like all currently approved migraine products that contain DHE, the STS101 formulation also contains mesylate salt. Per a request from the FDA, our dose strengths of STS101 are calculated as the active moiety without including the mesylate salt. As a result, for purposes of the following discussion, all references to STS101 doses herein are to the DHE content of such doses, whereas the doses for the Migranal and DHE mesylate IM injection include the mesylate in accordance with the commercially-available versions of such products. The STS101 DHE doses used in Part 1 of the trial were 1.3 mg (equivalent to 1.5 mg DHE mesylate), 2.6 mg (equivalent to 3.0 mg DHE mesylate) and 5.2 mg (equivalent to 6.0 mg DHE mesylate). Based on the results from Part 1, the STS101 5.2 mg (DHE) dose was selected for Part 2 of the clinical trial in which 27 subjects received STS101, Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray and an DHE mesylate IM injection in a random order.

STS101 Phase 1 Trial Design
 

As reflected in the figure below, Part 1 of the clinical trial demonstrated that DHE was rapidly absorbed after intranasal administration of single doses of STS101 1.3 mg, 2.6 mg, and 5.2 mg, with mean DHE plasma concentrations increasing in a dose-dependent manner. DHE plasma concentrations for STS101 2.6 and 5.2 mg rapidly exceeded 1.0 ng/ml. Based on published DHE PK and clinical trial data relating to DHE plasma concentrations and clinical efficacy of different DHE doses, we estimate that 1.0 ng/ml is the minimum threshold concentration necessary for therapeutic response to DHE. This conclusion is supported by data from certain clinical trials of Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray conducted by third parties, which have demonstrated that DHE plasma concentrations resulting from Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray are dose dependent and linear. In certain such studies, the administration of 2.0 mg of Migranal DHE mesylate resulted in a mean maximum concentration of approximately 1.0 ng/ml, while the administration of smaller doses of Migranal (e.g., 1.5 mg DHE mesylate) did not reach such maximum concentrations and failed to show statistically significant efficacy in controlled studies.
Phase 1, Part 1: Mean DHE Plasma Concentrations in Healthy Subjects after
 Administration of a Single Dose of STS101 (1.3 mg, 2.6 mg and 5.2 mg DHE)
 

Based on the PK, safety and tolerability data from Part 1 of our Phase 1 clinical trial, we selected STS101 5.2 mg for evaluation in Part 2 of the clinical trial.
 As reflected in the figure below, in Part 2 of our Phase 1 clinical trial, DHE plasma concentrations rose rapidly after administration of STS101 5.2 mg and DHE mesylate IM injection, with mean concentrations exceeding 1.0 ng/ml at 10 minutes and 5 minutes after dosing, respectively. In contrast, the mean maximum DHE plasma concentration after Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray administration did not reach 1.0 ng/ml. In general, the amount of DHE delivered by STS101 5.2 mg into systemic circulation over time was approximately 2-fold greater as compared with Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray and was approximately 83% of the amount delivered by an DHE mesylate IM injection. Importantly, in our Phase 1 clinical trial, the DHE plasma concentration profiles observed following administration of Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray and DHE mesylate IM injection were consistent with historical data, including those data included in the Migranal summary basis of approval.
 11


Phase 1, Part 2: Mean DHE Plasma Concentration in Healthy Subjects after Administration of a Single Dose of STS101 5.2 mg DHE, DHE Mesylate IM Injection 1.0 mg, and Migranal DHE Mesylate Liquid Nasal Spray 2.0 mg
 

Safety and Tolerability Profile
 In our STS101 Phase 1 clinical trial, all treatments were well tolerated, all adverse events were mild and transient, and no subject withdrew from the trial for an adverse event. Subjects treated with STS101 reported a higher frequency of nasal adverse events than those treated with DHE mesylate IM injection or Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray. The treatment emergent adverse events reported after STS101 administration, all of which were mild and transient, were nasal discomfort (STS101 5.2 mg (34%), IM injection (0%) and Migranal (7%)) nasal congestion (STS101 5.2mg (13%), IM Injection (0%) and Migranal (0%)), nasal itch (STS101 5.2mg (7.3%), IM Injection (0%), Migranal (0%)), rhinalgia (pain in the nose) (STS101 5.2mg (12%), IM Injection (0%) and Migranal (4%)), bitter or sour taste (STS101 5.2 mg (22%), IM Injection (0%) and Migranal (7%)), runny nose (STS101 5.2mg (15%), IM Injection (0%) and Migranal (0%)), shedding of tears (STS101 5.2 mg (7.3%), IM Injection (0%), Migranal (0%)), sneezing (STS101 5.2 mg (4.9%), IM Injection (0%), Migranal (0%)) and abdominal pain (STS101 5.2 mg (4.9%), IM injection (0%), Migranal (0%)). Patients receiving lower doses of STS101 reported fewer adverse events. No adverse events involving nausea or vomiting were reported after administration of STS101, IM injection or Migranal.
 We further assessed nasal symptoms utilizing a subjective nasal symptom severity score self-reported by subjects on the visual analog scale, or VAS score, on a zero to one-hundred scale in which zero represents absence of the symptom and one-hundred represents presence of the symptom with the worst imaginable severity. The average scores for nasal symptoms (including, abnormal taste, nasal blockage or obstruction, nasal burning, nasal discomfort, nasal itching, nasal pain, runny nose and sneezing) were all under 5 mm following administration of STS101 5.2 mg. In addition, subjective nasal symptom severity scores self-reported in Part 1 of our Phase 1 clinical by subjects treated with STS101 1.3 mg and 2.6 mg were negligible.
 12


Based on the safety and tolerability profile observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial, including the results of nasal examinations and subjective nasal symptom scores reported by subjects, we do not believe the tolerability of the STS101 5.2 mg dose should present a barrier to patient adoption or use, if approved.
 Comparison of STS101 PK Data to Other Non-Injectable DHE Products
 We conducted a further analysis comparing data from our Phase 1 clinical trial data of STS101 5.2 mg and Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray 2.0 mg to published data from earlier Phase 1 clinical trials of MAP0004, another company’s orally-inhaled, pulmonary-route DHE product candidate. Following such Phase 1 clinical trials, MAP0004 met all four of its primary efficacy endpoints and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, but was later discontinued by Allergan. The discontinuation of MAP0004 (previously referred to as the brand names Levadex and Semprana) followed multiple requests from the FDA that the developer address certain issues relating to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, after certain manufacturing deficiencies were identified during the FDA’s inspection of a facility operated by a third party manufacturer. As a result, MAP0004 was never approved by the FDA and no determination was made by the FDA with respect to its efficacy and safety.
 As the data presented below is based on a cross-trial comparison and not a head-to-head clinical trial, such data may not be directly comparable due to differences in study protocols, conditions and patient populations. Accordingly, cross-trial comparisons may not be reliable predictors of the relative efficacy or other benefits of STS101 compared to other product candidates that may be approved or that are or were in development for the acute treatment of migraine. In particular, our Phase 1 clinical trial and the Phase 3 clinical study of MAP0004 (FREEDOM-301) conducted by a third party used similar study designs with different patient eligibility criteria. While our Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted in healthy volunteers, the MAP0004 study (FREEDOM-301) required participants to have a one-year history of migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders and a baseline frequency of two to eight migraine attacks per month. In addition, our Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to provide PK, safety and tolerability data for STS101, whereas the MAP0004 study (FREEDOM-301), used four co-primary endpoints at the 2-hour post dosing time point: pain relief, photophobia-free, phonophobia-free, and nausea-free. The MAP0004 study (FREEDOM-301) reported similar age ranges, gender and race among the participants as our Phase 1 clinical trial of STS101.
 As reflected in the figures below, in our Phase 1 clinical trial, STS101 5.2 mg achieved greater DHE exposure by approximately 30 minutes and all time points thereafter as compared to DHE exposure achieved by MAP0004 in Phase 1 clinical trials conducted by its developer.
Mean DHE Plasma Concentration in Healthy Subjects after Administration of a Single Dose of
 STS101 5.2 mg DHE, Migranal DHE Mesylate Liquid Nasal Spray 2.0 mg and MAP0004 1.0 mg
 

13


In addition, in our Phase 1 clinical trial, STS101 5.2 mg showed significantly lower variability in peak DHE plasma concentrations and the amounts of DHE delivered into systemic circulation over 0.5, 2 and 48 hours after administration as compared to Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray. The variability of STS101 in peak plasma concentrations and in DHE exposure expressed as area-under-curve, or AUC, over 2 and 48 hours was comparable to that of MAP0004 in a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by its developer. The figure below reflects the PK variability of STS101 5.2 mg and Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray from our Phase 1 clinical trial and the previously reported third-party Phase 1 clinical trial data for MAP0004 measured by a mean percent coefficient of variation, which represents the variability of the specified data points.
 PK Variability of STS101 5.2 mg DHE vs. Other Non-Injectable DHE Products
 

As reflected in the figure below, total DHE exposure with STS101 5.2 mg in our Phase 1 clinical trial was almost three times greater than reported for MAP0004 in a Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by its developer. Within one hour after administration, STS101 5.2 mg delivered greater amounts of DHE into systemic circulation as compared to the amounts of DHE delivered into systemic circulation by Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray and MAP0004 over two hours.
 14


DHE Exposure (AUC) for STS101 5.2 mg DHE and Other Non-Injectable DHE Products
 

In summary, the results from the STS101 Phase 1 clinical trial showed that, within 10 minutes after administration, STS101 5.2 mg achieved target DHE plasma concentrations exceeding 1.0 ng/ml and remained above this level for over 2.5 hours. Furthermore, trial results showed that in comparison with Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray, STS101 5.2 mg achieved more than a 2-fold higher mean maximum DHE plasma concentration, achieved the maximum concentration much more rapidly, and delivered nearly 2-fold as much DHE into systemic circulation.
 Based on our Phase 1 clinical trial data and published data from separate clinical trials conducted by others for different DHE products, including a large Phase 3 study conducted with MAP0004, we believe that the PK profile of STS101 may lead to strong clinical performance expressed in rapid onset of pain relief, excellent 2-hour pain free rates, and sustained efficacy and low recurrence rates at 24 and 48 hours. Accordingly, we believe STS101 has the potential to treat a broad spectrum of migraine types, including those that are often difficult to treat, such as menstrual-related migraine, migraine upon awakening, migraine with allodynia, migraine associated with severe pain and migraine with nausea and vomiting. We expect to prospectively evaluate the performance of STS101 in these subgroups during our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial.
 Comparing efficacy data of a third-party DHE product candidate, MAP0004, with efficacy data of other emerging treatments for migraine
 We performed a cross-trial comparative analysis of the largest placebo-adjusted effect size for key endpoints in Phase 3 trials conducted by third parties of investigational and approved therapeutics for the acute treatment of migraine across a range of classes including inhaled DHE (MAP0004), oral CGRP antagonists (rimegepant, and ubrogepant) and an oral 5HT1F agonist (lasmiditan). The comparative analysis indicated that the DHE product MAP0004 had a greater effect size across a range of efficacy measures relative to the other product candidates.
 We also conducted a comparison of the migraine attack severity, timing-of-treatment in relation to migraine onset, and study design information available to us from the clinical trials of the various product candidates. This comparison indicated that a larger proportion of treated patients in the MAP0004 Phase 3 trial experienced severe migraine attacks versus those treated patients in the Phase 3 trials for lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant. In addition, we believe the MAP0004 Phase 3 trial allowed for a longer time window for treatment relative to the other trials.
 15


The data presented below for each product candidate represents data from the trial with the largest placebo-adjusted effect size for each endpoint (the percentage of responding patients treated with study medication less the percentage of responding patients treated with placebo), where multiple trials have been conducted for a product candidate. Not all available trial data is presented. As the data presented below is based on a cross-trial comparison and not head-to-head clinical trials, such data may not be directly comparable due to differences in study protocols, statistical analysis methods, conditions and patient populations. Accordingly, cross-trial comparisons may not be reliable predictors of the relative efficacy or other benefits of product candidates that may be approved or that are or were in development for the acute treatment of migraine.
 The Phase 3 clinical studies with rimegepant, ubrogepant, lasmiditan and MAP0004 were all conducted between 2008 to 2018 and used substantially similar study designs and patient eligibility criteria. All studies required participants to have a one-year history of migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders and a baseline frequency of two to eight migraine attacks per month. All studies were double-blinded, placebo-controlled and assessed the efficacy and safety of self-administered study medication or placebo in the outpatient setting following the treatment of a single migraine attack with moderate or severe pain during the treatment period. The lasmiditan studies allowed the use of a second dose for rescue, but the primary analyses were based on the first dose administered. The MAP0004 study (FREEDOM-301) used four co-primary endpoints at the 2-hour post dosing time point: pain relief, photophobia-free, phonophobia-free, and nausea-free. Pain free at two hours was used as a secondary endpoint. The studies with rimegepant, ubrogepant, and lasmiditan used freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom (selected by the patient from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at 2-hours post dosing as co-primary endpoints. Pain relief, photophobia-free, phonophobia-free, and nausea-free were used as secondary endpoints. All studies reported similar age ranges, gender and race among the participants. Placebo-adjusted effect sizes, are shown for the different endpoints to account for possible differences in the placebo response rates in the studies.
 In addition, while MAP0004 was a DHE-based product candidate, none of the clinical trials presented below studied STS101. The performance of STS101 across these or other efficacy measures in our planned clinical trials may differ materially from any results that could be inferred from this cross-trial comparison, including due to differences between MAP0004 and STS101, as well as differences in study protocols, statistical analysis methods, conditions and patient populations.

Development Plan
 Our development plan for STS101 is informed by published FDA guidance as well our discussions with the FDA. Following completion of our Phase 1 study, the FDA provided us with written feedback on our proposed STS101 development program, which is comprised of a single Phase 3 efficacy trial and a single Phase 3 safety trial to support approval of STS101 for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura. Our development program is intended to support registration of STS101 through the 505(b)(2) approval pathway. We plan to conduct both trials in the United States.
Phase 3 Efficacy Trial
 Our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial is a multi-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in approximately 1,140 patients experiencing episodic migraine attacks. To establish eligibility, study participants must have at least two but no more than eight migraine attacks during a 28-day screening period. After establishing full eligibility, the study participants are randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of three treatments: STS101 DHE 3.9 mg, STS101 DHE 5.2 mg or matching placebo. After randomization, the trial participants are instructed to treat their next migraine attack of at least moderate pain severity with the allocated blinded study medication. All study participants are trained multiple times in the STS101 administration procedure prior to use, and we provide each participant with an electronic device preloaded with diary software designed to capture relevant trial data.
 Our EMERGE trial follows certain of the recommendations outlined in the FDA Guidance Migraine: Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment, February 2018. In particular, the two co-primary endpoints of our EMERGE trial to be assessed at two hours after STS101 administration are freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom. We believe the trial is powered to achieve these endpoints (i.e. at greater than 99% power for the freedom from pain endpoint and greater than 95% power for the freedom from most bothersome symptom endpoint). In addition, several secondary endpoints, including those suggested in the FDA guidance, are incorporated into the trial protocol. Such endpoints include rescue medication usage, headache relapse measurements, and functional impairment scales. Further, we expect to prospectively evaluate the performance of STS101 in patient subgroups, including menstrual-related migraine, migraine upon awakening, migraine with allodynia, migraine associated with severe pain and migraine with nausea and vomiting, during our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial to assess whether further study may be of interest. If both doses are successful in our EMERGE trial, then both doses may be submitted in the NDA.
 17


The figure below provides details of the trial design of our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial:
 STS101 Phase 3 EMERGE Efficacy Trial Design
 

If successful, we believe our EMERGE trial’s differentiated secondary endpoints and clinical performance in prospectively-defined patient subgroups, could provide us with a strong foundation for promotion and commercialization. Labels for current DHE products, such as D.H.E. 45® and Migranal, do not address the differentiating attributes of DHE and its potential to address unmet needs of many patients with difficult-to-treat migraine types, which we believe has led to low clinical awareness of its benefits by physicians other than headache specialists.
 We initiated our EMERGE trial in July 2019 and expect topline data in the second half of 2020.
 Phase 3 Safety Trial
 We also plan to initiate a Phase 3 safety trial of STS101. This safety trial is expected to be a multi-center, open-label, 12-month trial in episodic migraine patients, with target enrollment depending on results of the EMERGE Phase 3 trial. After establishing eligibility, the study participants will be expected to use STS101 on an as-needed basis to treat migraine attacks for up to 12 months. Consistent with written feedback from FDA, we anticipate that at least 150 and 50 subjects will complete six and twelve months, respectively. Following the completion of this trial, if successful, we expect to submit our NDA to the FDA by the end of 2021.
Additional Trials
 We may undertake additional clinical trials with STS101 to enhance its clinical profile. For example, unless we can successfully demonstrate by conducting a drug-drug interaction study that the coadministration of STS101 and certain other drugs does not result in inhibition of DHE metabolism and elevated DHE levels, the FDA is likely to require a “black box” warning in the label for STS101, if approved, in line with the warnings that are included in the labels for other approved DHE products.
 Because migraine affects adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) and children (six to eleven years of age), pediatric studies are required under the Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. To address such requirements, we designed an initial pediatric study plan, or iPSP, consistent with the FDA guidance Migraine: Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment, February 2018, which we submitted as an amendment to the STS101 investigational new drug application in May 2019. In August 2019, the FDA provided comments to our iPSP in which the FDA agreed with our plan to request a waiver of clinical studies in children under age six. We have 
 18


revised the iPSP to address the FDA’s comments on our proposed study plan for children (six to eleven years of age) and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) and our requests for a deferral of any pediatric studies until after the initial approval of STS101 in the adult population in October 2019, and the revised iPSP is currently under review by the FDA. While we plan to work with the FDA to finalize the iPSP, and to our knowledge the FDA has not previously required initiation of pediatric studies for any drug for the acute treatment of migraine prior to its approval in the adult population, there can be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately grant our proposed waiver and/or deferrals. As a result, we could be required to conduct pediatric studies in such patient populations prior to or following any approval of STS101. Under the pediatric exclusivity provision of the FDCA, if FDA issues a written request for the pediatric studies and they are conducted pursuant to the written request, STS101 could qualify for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity. Moreover, if the conducted iPSP leads to an approval of STS101 for pediatric migraine patients this population could use STS101.
 To date, we and SNBL have completed preliminary human factor studies that we believe support self-administration of STS101 in the outpatient setting for the treatment of migraine and validate the STS101 instructions for use that we are utilizing in our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial, which we initiated in July 2019. We anticipate conducting further human factor studies.
 Regulatory Pathway
 Since DHE is well characterized and previously approved, we intend to seek FDA marketing approval of STS101 under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which provides an alternate path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations of products previously approved by the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from non-clinical studies and clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. By utilizing this pathway, and based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe we would be able to forego a Phase 2 clinical trial of STS101 by establishing that STS101 has comparative bioavailability to a reference listed drug with the PK results of our Phase 1 clinical trial.
 In the United States, we intend to pursue a 505(b)(2) NDA for STS101 referencing the NDAs for D.H.E. 45 (DHE mesylate injectable solution) and Migranal (DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray). Migranal has no therapeutic equivalents (other than an authorized generic) and is not covered under any unexpired patents that could delay approval of our NDA. We believe this development strategy could provide both an expeditious and cost-efficient approval pathway for STS101 in the United States, including by enabling us to forego a Phase 2 clinical trial. Our Phase 3 efficacy trial is intended to clinically and commercially differentiate STS101 from the reference products.
 Manufacturing
 Our manufacturing and regulatory teams, although limited in size, have substantial experience in manufacturing process development, registration and the commercial manufacture of drug-device combination products, including inhalation-route drug-device combination products. We do not have any manufacturing facilities and all of our manufacturing processes, which must comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, are outsourced to third parties with oversight by our internal managers. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of drug product for use in clinical trials. We intend to continue this practice for any future clinical trials and large-scale commercialization of STS101.
 We selected processes for manufacturing of STS101 that we believe are readily scalable and transferable, and all of our STS101 manufacturing processes employ standard technologies that are commonly utilized in the pharmaceutical industry for the manufacture of approved drug and drug-device combination products. However, certain processes for the manufacture of STS101 involve trade secrets and/or require custom or semi-custom equipment that is not available for off-the-shelf purchase, requires substantial investment, and/or has long lead times associated with its design, manufacture, delivery, installation and qualification.
 For clinical supplies used in the development of STS101, we contract with CMOs to manufacture the final powder drug formulation and to semi-automatically fill the powder formulation into and manually assemble the STS101 nasal delivery device.
 19


The drug substance of STS101 is supplied by a drug substance manufacturer, which has extensive experience manufacturing the STS101 drug substance under cGMP, has an active Drug Master File, or DMF, registered with FDA, and has the capacity to meet our anticipated clinical and commercial supply needs. We believe there are additional drug substance manufacturers with active DMFs registered with the FDA that could potentially serve as back-up suppliers for us.
 The proprietary STS101 nasal powder delivery device plastic components are manufactured by two third-party CMOs using widely available common standard injection-molding and blow-molding equipment processes, and we are currently in the process of procuring the mold tooling, which we will own, that we plan to use for the manufacture of STS101 registration batches and commercial supplies.
 For commercial supply of STS101, we intend to contract with one of the same CMOs that we utilize to manufacture the final nasal powder formulation for our clinical supplies, and we expect to use the same standard equipment and processes as used in the manufacture of such clinical supplies. For large-scale automated filling, automated assembly and packaging of the STS101 nasal powder delivery device for commercialization, we intend to contract with a CMO that we are utilizing to semi-automatically fill and manually assemble the STS101 delivery devices to be used in the STS101 Phase 3 clinical trial program. Automated filling, assembly and packaging of STS101 commercial supplies will utilize semi-custom equipment for which we have contracted, and, with respect to packaging, intend to contract.
 Commercial Operations
 We recently hired an experienced Chief Commercial Officer. However, we currently have no other marketing staff and do not have sales organization. If approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine, we intend to market and commercialize STS101 in the United States by building a specialized sales organization focusing on headache specialists, as well as general neurologists and primary care physicians who are high prescribers of migraine therapeutics. Outside the United States, we intend to establish commercialization strategies for STS101 as we approach possible commercial approval in each market, which may include collaborations with other companies.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. If approved for the acute treatment of migraine, we anticipate that STS101 would compete against other marketed migraine therapies for the acute treatment of migraine and may compete with products currently under development by other companies.
 In 2018, over 15 million prescriptions for migraine-specific acute therapies were written in the United States. This figure excludes prescriptions of non-specific therapies, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, and thus likely understates the total number of prescriptions written for the acute treatment of migraine. The majority of the prescriptions written were for generic triptans. There are seven FDA-approved triptan molecules available in branded and branded generic/generic oral dosage forms, and two of these molecules are also available in injectable and/or liquid nasal spray dosage forms that may have faster onset of action than oral dosage forms. With respect to DHE products, we will compete with Bausch Health’s Migranal and its authorized generic, both of which are DHE liquid nasal spray products, as well as branded and generic DHE injectable products. In addition, we believe Impel NeuroPharma is developing a DHE liquid nasal spray product utilizing the same liquid formulation as Migranal, but with a different propellant-powered, single-use delivery device for which Impel NeuroPharma has indicated it plans to file an NDA in the second half of 2020. In addition, Promius Pharma has previously reported that it is developing a DHE nasal liquid spray product. We believe these products will suffer from many of the same limitations as Migranal and have not been reported to significantly improve DHE absorption or pharmacokinetics as compared with Migranal to an extent that we believe likely to be clinically relevant. Impel NeuroPharma in particular has indicated that it plans to pursue approval of its product on the basis of a clinical development program that includes only a comparative pharmacokinetic study and an open-label, uncontrolled, repeat-dose safety trial (and not a randomized, controlled, double-blinded Phase 3 efficacy study which the FDA typically requires to support any product-specific marketing claims relating to efficacy). There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully bring STS101 to the market faster than these liquid nasal spray candidates or compete against such products, if approved.
 20


We may also face competition from acute treatments for migraine recently approved by the FDA such as Eli Lilly’s lasmiditan, an oral 5HT1F agonist, and oral CGRP antagonists ubrogepant (Allergan) and rimegepant (Biohaven). Because lasmiditan, ubrogepant, and rimegepant are thought to act by mechanisms other than vasoconstriction, recommended use is not restricted to patients who do not have cardiovascular risk factors or disease, as is the case for triptan and ergot alkaloid products (including DHE) due to their vasoconstrictive actions. Although the labels for lasmiditan, ubrogepant and rimegepant do not limit use to patients without cardiovascular risk factors or disease, we believe these products have disadvantages. For example, lasmiditan has been reported to commonly cause central nervous system adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence and paresthesia, and the lasmiditan label includes warnings for driving impairment and operation of machinery for at least eight hours after taking a lasmiditan dose, central nervous system depression, serotonin syndrome, and medication overuse headache. Additionally, because lasmiditan has shown potential for abuse and dependence, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, has designated lasmiditan as a controlled substance; this designation imposes licensing and documentation requirements upon prescribers and as well restricts distribution. With ubrogepant and rimegepant, reported efficacy is modest in comparison with efficacy historically reported with triptan and DHE products. Moreover, prescribing of ubrogepant, and to a lesser extent rimegepant, may be complicated by the potential for interactions with a variety of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements, with this potential necessitating dose adjustment of or contraindication to ubrogepant. As well, although the ubrogepant and rimegepant labels do not contain liver toxicity warnings, the oral CGRP receptor antagonist class has previously been associated with rare but serious liver toxicity.
 Further, preventive treatment of migraine, could, if broadly adopted and used successfully, reduce the need and demand for acute treatment options. Injectable formulations of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (e.g. erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) have recently been approved for prevention of migraine attacks and Allergan and Biohaven have also reported that they are conducting clinical trials of oral CGRP antagonists for prevention of migraine attacks and Allergan and Biohaven have also reported that they are conducting clinical trials of oral CGRP antagonists for prevention of migraine attacks. In addition, Lundbeck (formerly Alder Biopharmaceuticals) recently announced it was commencing a study of its intravenously injected monoclonal CGRP antibody therapeutic, eptinezumab, which was approved in February 2020 by the FDA for prevention of migraine attacks, to evaluate it as an acute treatment for migraine.
 There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same markets as STS101. We expect any future products we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, extent of adverse side effects experienced and convenience of administration and drug delivery. One or more of our competitors may develop products based upon the principles underlying our proprietary technologies earlier than us, obtain approvals for such products from the FDA more rapidly than us or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than any future products developed by us. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize STS101 in our target commercial areas outside the United States. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for STS101, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know how, continuing technological innovation and potential in licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 With regard to STS101, we have patents and applications to formulations, dosages, devices, and methods of use.
 21


As of January 31, 2020, we have an exclusive license to 6 issued U.S. patents and 9 issued foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states, and own or have an exclusive license to various pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, U.S. provisional patent applications, and pending foreign patent applications, and an international Patent Cooperation Treat (PCT) patent application. Issued U.S. patents relating to STS101 are estimated to expire between 2029 and the end of 2033. If issued, future patents resulting from pending U.S. patent applications relating to STS101 would be estimated to expire between 2034 and 2039. All issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to STS101 were exclusively licensed from SNBL. The pending U.S. and foreign patent applications (including U.S. provisionals) relating to STS101 are solely owned by us or exclusively licensed from SNBL.
 The patent portfolio for STS101 is directed to cover formulations, dosages, devices, and methods of treatment. This patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national and regional counterpart patents and patent applications. The U.S. issued formulation patents and device patents are exclusively licensed from SNBL. Royalties on products covered by this exclusive license are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latter of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering such product and the ten year anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. For more information on the SNBL License, see the section titled “Business—Licenses and Collaborations.” We own U.S. patent applications relating to the formulations, dosages, and methods of use of STS101 for treatment.
 The terms of patents and patent applications, if issued, relating to STS101 in other jurisdictions (some of the major foreign jurisdictions include Europe, Japan, China, India, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Korea, Mexico, Russia), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other government fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2025 and 2039. We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions.
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention.
 Licenses and Collaborations
 In June 2016, we and SNBL, entered into a licensing and assignment agreement, or the SNBL License, which was amended and restated in December 2016 and further amended in January 2017, April 2017, and October 2017. We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on the SNBL License for purposes of our development and potential commercialization of STS101. From the time we entered into the SNBL License until the consummation of our Series A convertible preferred stock financing in December 2016, we were a subsidiary of SNBL and SNBL continues to hold over 5% of our outstanding capital stock. Under the SNBL License, SNBL assigned to us certain patent rights and know-how that are directed to SNBL’s proprietary nasal drug delivery technology, including its proprietary nasal delivery device, or the Device, and formulation technologies, for use with DHE, or the DHE Product. SNBL granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights and know-how, other than the assigned patent rights and know-how, to develop, make, use, and commercialize DHE Products in the field of treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of all indications and human medical conditions, as well as the products consisting of the Device used to deliver a combination of DHE and one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients other than DHE, or DHE Combination Products, in the field of treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of migraine and non-migraine headaches. We granted to SNBL a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license, under our rights in improvements to the Device, to develop, make, use, and commercialize products and devices other than DHE Products and DHE Combination Products. During the term of the SNBL License, we, SNBL, and our and SNBL’s affiliates are not permitted to develop or commercialize, or to 
 22


enable third parties to develop or commercialize, a product containing DHE as an active ingredient for delivery through nasal tissues or the respiratory system, other than pursuant to the SNBL License. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of DHE Products and DHE Combination Products under the SNBL License. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one such product, initially in the United States.
 Under the SNBL License, in 2016 we reimbursed SNBL for approximately $80,000 of costs relating to our incorporation and prosecution and maintenance of the product-specific patents. We also agreed to make royalty payments based on a low single-digit percentage of worldwide net sales of DHE Products and DHE Combination Products, payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering such product and the ten year anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The royalty payments are subject to reductions based on royalties paid to any third party under a license to such third party’s patent rights.
 We have the sole right to control the prosecution and maintenance of, and to enforce, the patent rights that SNBL assigned to us. SNBL has the first right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights that SNBL licensed to us. We have step in rights if SNBL does not continue such prosecution and maintenance. We also have the first right to enforce such licensed patent rights with respect to certain infringing products. If we do not bring an action to enforce such patents against infringing activities that involve such infringing products, SNBL has the right to bring such an action.
 The SNBL License will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of the obligation to pay royalties with respect such product and country. We may terminate the SNBL License in its entirety without cause on ninety days’ prior written notice. SNBL may terminate the SNBL License for our material breach that remains uncured for ninety days. SNBL may also terminate the SNBL License if we challenge the licensed patents, or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents. In addition, SNBL has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our insolvency.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Our product candidate, STS101, is subject to regulation in the United States as a drug-device combination product. If marketed individually, the drug component and the propriety device component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center within FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over the product’s regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of STS101, the FDA has confirmed that the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product. Accordingly, STS101 will be regulated as a drug product by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, which will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development and approval. We plan to seek approval of STS101 through a single new drug application, or NDA, submitted to CDER through the 505(b)(2) approval pathway. We do not expect that the FDA will require separate marketing authorization for the proprietary device constituent of STS101. However, the drug delivery device component of STS101 will be subject to consulting review by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and we will be required to comply with applicable provisions of the medical device Quality System Regulation as part of ensuring STS101 complies with cGMP. The FDA will also require that we conduct human factors studies to support approval of STS101. To date, we and SNBL have completed preliminary human factor studies that we believe support self-administration of STS101 in the outpatient setting for the treatment of migraine and validate the STS101 instructions for use that we are utilizing in our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial, which we initiated in July 2019. We anticipate conducting further human factor studies.

U.S. Drug Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use or new formulation of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA clinical holds, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before a clinical study may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility(ies) where the product is manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for its particular labeled uses in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Studies
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and any available human data or literature to support use of the product in humans. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
 24


Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s IRB before a study may be initiated at the site, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development and testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 25


The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. Priority review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
 The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that relevant study data was obtained in compliance with GCP requirements.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A tentative approval may be issued for an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA if the sponsor must await the expiration of applicable patents or other exclusivity covering the previously approved product referenced in the application before obtaining final approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. For 505(b)(2) NDAs, FDA will typically require a REMS if the reference product is required to have a REMS. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, or other elements to assure safe use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, all REMS programs must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy following implementation.
 Further, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety and efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the changes can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that supporting the original approval, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
 26


Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
 27


The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 ANDA Approval Process
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, with the FDA.
 An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA suitability petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug or is intended for a different use, and it is not otherwise subject to an approved suitability petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
 505(b)(2) NDAs
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired.
 28


Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, NDA holders may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA.
 A non-NCE drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval or change to a previously approved product, such as a new formulation or method of administration for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has concluded. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and being the review process during the exclusivity period. A drug approved under Section 505(b)(2) may also be eligible for pediatric exclusivity if the FDA issues a Written Request for one or more pediatric studies, the manufacturer conducts the studies and submits written reports to the FDA, and such studies meet the conditions of the Written Request. If granted, pediatric exclusivity extends any existing marketing exclusivity or patent protection for the product by an additional six months.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we could become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market STS101 in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare Laws
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, false claims, civil monetary penalties laws, consumer protection and transparency laws as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal 
 29


Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other healthcare professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligation, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
 In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than HIPAA and many of which may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context.

European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018, repealing its predecessor directive and increasing responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical companies in relation to the processing of personal data of EU data subjects. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. No uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among U.S. third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Existing acute treatments for migraine are generally covered or reimbursed by third-party payers and, based on preliminary primary market research we have conducted with certain third-party payers, we believe that STS101, if approved, would qualify for coverage and reimbursement substantially similar to other branded acute treatments for migraine; however, such research is preliminary and we cannot guarantee the availability of coverage or adequacy of reimbursement at this time.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that a product will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell a product profitably.

Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2029 absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Further, the Trump Administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
