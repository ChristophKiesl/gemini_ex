PART I 
Item 1. | Business

On October 31, 2016, Adient plc ("Adient") became an independent company as a result of the separation of the automotive seating and interiors businesses (the "separation") of Johnson Controls International plc ("the former Parent"). Adient was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 24, 2016 for the purpose of holding these businesses. Adient's ordinary shares began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol "ADNT" on the New York Stock Exchange on October 31, 2016. Upon becoming an independent company, the capital structure of Adient consisted of 500 million authorized ordinary shares and 100 million authorized preferred shares (par value of $0.001 per ordinary and preferred share). The number of Adient ordinary shares issued on October 31, 2016 was 93,671,810.

The Seating reportable segment produces automotive seat metal structures and mechanisms, foam, trim, fabric and complete seat systems. The Interiors reportable segment, primarily derived from the YFAI global automotive interiors joint venture completed on July 2, 2015, produces instrument panels, floor consoles, door panels, overhead consoles, cockpit systems, decorative trim and other products. Prior to the completion of the joint venture, the Interiors reportable segment produced instrument panels, floor consoles and door panels. These segments reflect the way Adient evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Further information regarding Adient's reportable segments may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Segment Analysis," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note 17, "Segment Information," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Global Manufacturing Footprint and Functional Expertise Adient operates a global network of approximately 238 manufacturing plants in 34 countries that supplies automotive OEMs with complete seats, modules and components. In fiscal 2017, Adient delivered more than 25 million seat systems on a "just-in-time or in-sequence" basis globally. Those businesses supplied seating systems on more than 360 nameplates to 40 different OEMs. Adient's industry-leading technologies complement proven expertise in consumer insights and marketing, value product planning, product design for cost, design for manufacturing, system integration, evaluation, validation and manufacturing. Adient's approximately 85,000 highly skilled and engaged employees have earned a reputation for delivering high quality, value-added seating and interiors products that support auto manufacturers' goals of brand differentiation.
Longstanding Customer Relationships with Leading Global OEMs Adient works with OEMs to develop complete seating solutions to meet and exceed consumer expectations for performance, safety and comfort. Adient does business with all major global OEM customers, and in many cases, works closely with those customers to develop a seating solution integrated into the overall vehicle appearance and architecture.

Adient's efficient operations provide opportunities for continued vertical integration in areas that could enhance Adient's capabilities, expand profit margins and grow revenues with customers who employ component sourcing strategies. Adient believes that as a vertically integrated supplier with global scale and strong 

Adient plc | Form 10-K | 5

design, engineering and lean manufacturing capabilities in both complete seat systems and components, it is well positioned to benefit from these opportunities.

• | Business expansion. Adient is able to leverage its track record of low cost, high quality, effectively executed product launches and ability to maintain high customer satisfaction to pursue growth into additional product markets adjacent to the automotive industry. 

Business Strategy
Adient focuses on growing its business through the following strategies, among others:
Cash Flow Generation Adient expects to generate strong cash flows. The anticipated cash from operating activities generated by Adient should allow it to pay down debt and invest in the business to support organic growth. Excess cash flow could also allow Adient to pursue other alternatives, including new capital investment projects, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and/or share repurchases. However, there can be no guarantee that Adient will pay dividends in a timely manner, or at all, or that Adient will repurchase any of its shares or the price at which any such repurchase may occur.
Customer Focus and Commercial Management Through dedicated customer teams, Adient maintains close relationships with its global OEM customers. These relationships enable Adient to clearly understand its customers' needs so that it is positioned to meet its customers' requirements. Adient's customer teams lead the new business acquisition process, which ensures alignment with Adient's product, process and manufacturing strategies. These teams partner with customers in identifying optimal product solutions to meet product demand, and also lead commercial negotiations with Adient's customers. Adient believes that its commercial teams excel at balancing these commercial topics to find "win/win" solutions for the customer and for Adient.
To enhance customer experience and drive loyalty, Adient gathers customer feedback through annual "voice of the customer" surveys. Customer input from these surveys, as well as daily customer interaction, guides Adient's improvement activities in quality, cost and delivery. Input from customers, tracked using a customer relationship management tool to improve account management, enables prompt attention to customer concerns. Adient expects that its commercial management efforts will continue to yield outstanding performance and results.
Product Innovation and Process Leadership Adient has a strong record for developing winning product and process technologies over many years, which has created a competitive advantage for Adient and its customers. Management expects to increase investment in innovation. 
Adient utilizes a Global Core Product Portfolio, or CPP, strategy for part and design reuse in all of its product applications. Adient intends to continue investing in its CPP to sustain and expand its market success and to leverage its existing modular and scalable systems and interchangeable components. Through the CPP strategy, Adient provides high quality products for its customers with market competitive cost and mass (low weight to improve fuel economy) while meeting their performance requirements. Adient intends to continue using its CPP to advance Adient's lean manufacturing initiatives by providing standard, flexible processes that reduce complexity, inventory and floor space. This will yield reductions in development time, product cost and investment.
Product templates and knowledge documents are continually updated with lessons learned from previous development programs. Knowledge is transferred from these templates into the next program design, drawings and documents. This development strategy has significantly reduced the average seating program development time. The continued use of this process will add value to customers' products and Adient through higher performing products, development time compression and lower costs.
Adient is also investing in a new Product Lifecycle Management, or PLM, system. This system is an interactive and interdisciplinary collaboration tool that will serve as a management database for program, product and process related data and simplifies the management of automotive seating programs and associated data. It is also expected to aid in the standardization of the development process and in communication with all sites that support global program execution. The PLM system not only will serve as storage for data and documents, but also will support workflow, schedule and change management of ongoing or upcoming programs, thereby enabling effective decision making and program management.

Leadership Position in China Adient has an advantaged position in China established through strategic partnerships it developed as an early market entrant. Adient is the largest supplier of "just-in-time" seating in China.* It operates through 19 joint ventures with 73 manufacturing locations in 38 cities, which are supported by additional technical centers. Adient's strong position with European and American automakers is complemented by partnerships with all major auto groups in China, which has resulted in Adient's broad market penetration relative to seating competitors and market leadership in the industry's largest and one of the fastest-growing markets. Adient leverages its operating expertise and innovation capabilities developed worldwide to further support its growth in China. Adient expects revenues in China to continue to grow as the automotive market continues to expand.
Operational Efficiencies Adient intends to maintain high capacity utilization and increase its efficiency through continued use of standardized manufacturing processes, which represent a core competency. These standardized manufacturing processes allow Adient to deliver exceptional quality levels and minimize waste. Adient achieves scale advantages through a global manufacturing footprint and an integrated supply chain. Adient fosters an environment of continuous improvement and identifies best business practices through the analysis of process and cost metrics, which are then shared globally throughout Adient's manufacturing network.
To ensure superior service levels, minimal inventory and optimal factory utilization, Adient employs a rigorous Sales & Operational Planning, or S&OP, process. A well-executed S&OP process provides two strategic advantages: superior customer service and on-time delivery which result in both customer retention and the opportunity for market share gain.
Adient's focus on global operational efficiencies will also be applied to its corporate cost structure, which Adient expects will produce a lean corporate overhead structure. Adient believes that maintaining a lean and operationally efficient process throughout the organization will enable it to be a market leader in cost and that this will result in margin expansion. Adient also intends to continue streamlining the mechanisms and structures operations, which are capital intensive with long lead times and designs that span multiple vehicle platforms. Adient has made progress integrating product and process technologies across metal structures and mechanisms; however, opportunities still exist to streamline the product and process portfolio.
Research and Development Costs
Expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement (other than those expenditures that are contractually guaranteed for reimbursement from the customer) are charged against income as incurred and included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Such expenditures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $488 million, $460 million and $599 million, respectively. A portion of these costs associated with these activities is reimbursed by customers and, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $350 million, $308 million and $364 million, respectively. 
Product/Systems
Adient designs and manufactures a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient's technologies extend into virtually every area of automotive seating solutions including complete seating systems, frames, mechanisms, foam, head restraints, armrests, trim covers and fabrics. Adient also supplies high performance seating systems to the international motorsports industry through its award winning RECARO brand of products.

Industry
The Automotive Seating industry provides OEMs with complete seats on a "just-in-time" or "in-sequence" basis. Seats are assembled to specific order and delivered on a predetermined schedule directly to an automotive assembly line. The components for these complete seat assemblies such as seating foam, metal structures, fabrics, seat covers and seat mechanisms are shipped to Adient or competitor seating assembly plants. Adient is the world's largest* in complete seat assembly and one of the largest in all major seating components, operating manufacturing plants that produce seating foam, metal structures, fabrics, seat covers and seat mechanisms.
Overall, Adient expects long-term growth of vehicle sales and production in the OEM market. The industry has experienced overall growth during the past few years. In the most recent year, vehicle production increased by 19% in South America, 6% in China, 5% in other Asia, and 3% in Europe, and decreased by 3% in North America. 
Demand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive supplier industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. Adient believes that, as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, it is well positioned to benefit from these opportunities. In addition, Adient expects to leverage these capabilities to pursue future growth in adjacent markets.
Sourcing Patterns by OEMs Most OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. In seating, three sourcing patterns have emerged over the past five years:

1. | Core seat structures: By developing common front seat frames and mechanisms across multiple vehicle platforms, OEMs are reducing costs. 


2. | Component sourcing: Several OEMs have shifted from sourcing a complete seating system to a components approach where the OEM sources each of the different components of the seat and seating assembly as separate business awards. 


3. | Engineering "in-sourcing": Some OEMs are conducting the design and engineering internally and are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis and adapt to regional variations. 

Adient believes that as a supplier with global scale and strong design, engineering and lean manufacturing capabilities in both complete seat systems and components it is well-positioned to benefit from each of these three sourcing pattern developments and views these as opportunities.
Shorter Product Development Cycles As a result of new safety and environmental regulations, as well as a trend of more rapid customer preference changes, OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. Although these trends are more significant in mature markets, emerging markets are moving rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.
Autonomous Driving As the industry moves towards autonomous driving and alternative usage models such as car sharing and urban mobility, Adient has developed an interiors concept for autonomous driving which addresses major seating and other interior trends that are expected to drive the automotive industry of the future. Adient will continue to partner with OEM's and other customers to lead in the development of autonomous driving concepts.

Competition
Adient faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the automobile OEMs who produce or have the capability to produce certain products the business supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering and product planning are increasingly important factors. The competitive landscape for seating and components can be categorized into three segments: (1) traditional seating suppliers, (2) component specialists and (3) competitors who are partnered with an OEM through ownership or interlocking business relationships. Independent suppliers that represent the principal competitors of Adient include Lear Corporation, Faurecia SA and Magna International Inc. The businesses operated through YFAI primarily compete with Faurecia SA, Grupo Antolin-Irausa SA and International Automotive Components Group SA. Adient's deep vertical integration, global footprint and broad product offering make it well positioned to compete against the traditional global Tier-1's and component specialists.
Raw Materials
Raw materials used by Adient in connection with its operations, including steel, aluminum, polyurethane chemicals, fabrics, leather, vinyl and polypropylene, were readily available during fiscal 2017, and Adient expects such availability to continue. During fiscal 2018, commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and significantly affect Adient's results of operations.
Intellectual Property
Generally, Adient seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements.
Adient owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. While Adient believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. Adient, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others.
Adient's trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of Adient are sold. Adient, from time to time, becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions.
Most works of authorship produced for Adient, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating Adient's claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.
Regulation
Adient operates in a constantly evolving global regulatory environment and is subject to numerous and varying regulatory requirements for its product performance and material content. Adient's practice is to identify potential regulatory and quality risks early in the design and development process and proactively manage them throughout the product lifecycle through use of routine assessments, protocols, standards, performance measures and audits. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are managed in collaboration with the OEM customers and implemented through Adient's global systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations. Adient demonstrates material content compliance through the International Material Data System, or IMDS, which is the automotive industry material data system. In the IMDS, all materials used for car manufacturing are archived and maintained, in order to meet the obligations placed on the car manufacturers-and thus on their suppliers-by national and international standards, laws and regulations.
Adient works collaboratively with a number of stakeholder groups including government agencies (e.g., National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), its customers and its suppliers to proactively engage in federal, state and international public policy processes.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Adient is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters, and various other matters. Although the outcome of such lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Adient, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on 
Adient plc | Form 10-K | 9

Adient's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented. Further details regarding Adient's commitments and contingencies is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note 19, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, Adient employed approximately 85,000 employees, of whom approximately 68,000 were hourly and 17,000 were salaried.
Seasonal Factors
Adient's principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, Adient may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays.
