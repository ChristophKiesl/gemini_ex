Organizational History
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary LifeApps, Inc., we are a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple Apps Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. We are also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. We have distributed apps on all three platforms. Moving forward we are developing new apps and exploring new opportunities pairing apps with physical retail and e-commerce/mobile-commerce products.
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware as Prime Time Travel, Inc. on November 23, 2010, for the purpose of creating and managing trips to destination locations for youth basketball teams. On August 23, 2012, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to, among other things, change our name from Prime Time Travel, Inc. to LifeApps Digital Media Inc., and increase our authorized capitalization to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.
 
On September 5, 2012, we effected a 15-for-1 forward stock split in the form of a dividend to holders of our common stock as of record on September 4, 2012.
 
On September 20, 2012, LifeApps Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary of ours, merged with and into LifeApps Inc., which had been organized as a California limited liability company on July 13, 2009, and was converted to a Nevada corporation on September 7, 2012 in anticipation of the merger.  In connection with the merger, each share of LifeApps common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 400 shares of our common stock. LifeApps was the surviving corporation of that Merger. As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of LifeApps, and are continuing the existing business operations of LifeApps as our primary business operations.
 
Immediately following the merger, we split off our wholly owned subsidiary, Prime Time Split Corp., a Delaware corporation, through the exchange of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Split Corp.  All of our assets and liabilities immediately following the merger, excluding any assets and liabilities assumed in the merger, were transferred to Split Corp.
 
On December 31, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to (i) change our corporate name to LifeApps Brands Inc., (ii) effect a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and (iii) increase our authorized capitalization from 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Reverse Split and Name Change took effect on OTC Markets at the commencement of business on January 7, 2016, at which time our common stock began trading on a post-reverse split basis.

Business Overview
 
LifeApps® is a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. LifeApps® is also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. LifeApps® has distributed apps/publications on all three platforms. Moving forward LifeApps is enhancing existing apps and developing new apps, and exploring new opportunities pairing apps with physical retail and e-commerce/mobile-commerce products.
 
As individuals continue to migrate to mobile devices for their information and entertainment from traditional media and consumption sources such as the personal computers and print publications, the opportunity to reach more consumers with a wider range of digitally enhanced multi-media tools is possible. Unlike traditional print and disc based (DVD) media which have a limited shelf life, we will be able to continually augment our products to include more entertainment based content and information through enhanced media such as videos, audio, podcasts, push alerts, in-app messaging and app updates, which extend the life of our products beyond the first sale. Internet connected mobile devices and mobile applications provide real time communication with customers, and strengthen our ability to deliver timely and relevant content and messages to them.

As mobile devices have become more feature rich, people are engaging their phones more frequently for tasks beyond placing phone calls, including, for example, app usage, social media, text messaging and photography. According to Cisco, by 2017, there will be nearly 1.4 mobile devices per capita.
 
The Mobile space as a whole continues to evolve. According to Hostingfacts.com for 2016 there are more mobile internet users than desktop internet users; 52.7% of global internet users access the internet via mobile, and 75.1% of U.S. internet users access the internet via mobile. Mobile advertising spend is projected to account for 60.4% of all digital advertising spend by 2016 and 72.2% of all digital advertising spend by 2019. In 2015, mobile influenced retail sales to the tune of over $1 trillion. B2C mobile commerce sales in the U.S. is valued at an estimated $83.93 billion.
 
In 2015 Pew Research Center issued a report of US Smartphone use. One of the many statistics reported were more than half of Smartphone owners have used their phone to get health information, and do online banking. It was also reported that 44% have used their Smartphone to look up real estate listings and 43% to look up information about a job. On November 22, 2015 Apple reported that it has shipped its 1 billionth iOS device.
 
According to Statista (Statistics Portal) global app downloads are projected to reach 268 billion in 2017.
 
LifeApps® is also expanding its revenue generating potential through the creation of new gateway digital platforms that combine e-commerce with mobile-commerce solutions to act as conduits or meeting places for users to engage in the commerce. These gateway platforms can also be utilized and distributed across the broader base of the LifeApps® suite of products.
 
LifeApps® will continue to explore acquisitions of companies and new technologies. In addition, the company will also explore the acquisition of consumer related products as well. Such acquisitions will be considered where the purchase can help increase our revenues, or enable the Company to attain assets that will allow us to gain technological advances that would be more costly to develop than to purchase.
 
LifeApps® will continue a flexible approach as opportunities arise from the emergence of these rapidly evolving mobile hardware and software markets. LifeApps® will focus resources where they will be the most effective at growing the business and driving revenues. LifeApps® ability for internal development and external purchase of new technologies and companies will depend upon its ability to raise future financing.
 
Our Products
 
LifeApps Mobile App Platform
 
LifeApps’ iOS Tutorial App Platform is an icon based user interface that is familiar to anyone who has used a smartphone. With customization from icon shapes, icon frames, icon flags, and color selection (frames and menu bars), each app can be given a familiar yet distinct design. Users can also replace backgrounds and key imagery with photos from their camera or photo library.
 
Within the app itself, tutorial pages can be navigated by simply swiping between pages. How-To photos are presented through automatically playing slideshows using clear, high-quality photography.
 
Utilizing the familiar icon-based drag-and-drop system, exercise routines can be easily customized and arranged. This allows users the flexibility to choose from the entire library of tutorials to create their own playlists. For instance, a user can create a unique routine for each day of the week.
 
This platform also boasts a robust data management system that allows for data recording on an element-by-element basis. All fields can be fully customized and the data can be displayed and aggregated.
 
The LifeApps Mobile App Platform has been updated to integrate with Apple’s HealthKit. This integration improves the experience of the apps allowing them to both send and receive fitness and health data with other HealthKit enabled apps and sensory devices.
 
Video Management is a key element to the platform as well. Within the app’s video management system users can download video content, see how much memory space they have available and see how much space the video is using. They can also remove videos to free up space on their devices. Video can be grouped into categories and made available as free downloads or through in-app purchases.
 
Social Media is integrated into the app, allowing users to share their data via Facebook, Twitter and email. A robust online Push-Alerts manager has been created, allowing for scheduled delivery to the users of the app of push alerts, messages sent from an app that update users as to new content. These messages are short and appear as an alert on the user’s home screen when received.

Within the app, an HTML based messaging center allows for additional, more robust communication to the users. These messages can be as long as desired and can include photo and video embeds, just like any web page. Delivery of these messages is also managed through a robust online manager and can be scheduled for future delivery.
 
LifeApps® believes that the tutorial app is the next evolution of the DVD tutorial. With the one-and-you’re-done nature of DVD production and the reliance on a relatively immobile delivery device, the DVD is becoming less relevant in today’s fast-paced mobile world. Mobile apps can deliver all of the same content plus interactivity and data processing. Mobile apps are also “always with you” on your mobile device, eliminating the need for finding something to play the content on. Users are also able to receive additional content, messages, and even advertising from within the app, adding value and convenience that the traditional video tutorial can’t deliver.
 
LifeApps® is building in-house apps on the LifeApps iOS Tutorial App Platform and is looking to drive Company revenues by releasing LifeApps® brands, such as MDWorkout®, and licensing and developing apps with partners utilizing this platform.
 
Revenue
 
LifeApps® intends to monetize and drive revenue through a combination of its software development, e-commerce/mobile-commerce of mobile applications and in-app sales, subscriptions and advertising across all platforms.
 
LifeApps® seeks to continue a multi-pronged approach as opportunities arise from the emergence of these rapidly evolving mobile hardware and software markets. LifeApps® will focus resources where they will be the most effective at growing both the long-term business objectives and driving immediate revenues.
 
The company continues to pursue partnerships with healthcare providers who are expanding into mobile health. As traditional healthcare looks to expand its telemedicine offerings, the mobile health market will grow from its current state as an emerging market into a diverse mix of healthcare services, providers, developers and insurance providers. The company believes that it is important to continue our software and business development efforts in the category. We believe this is a significant and important core business to the company long-term, however generating significant near-term revenues from our mobile medicine platform may prove to be challenging.
 
LifeApps Mobile App Platform
 
LifeApps® intends to continue to develop and license the LifeApps Mobile App Platform. We will research and seek out aligned companies with need for tutorial based apps for mobile and we will work to create new revenue through development and licensing of our presentation format for their use. We will pursue a business model of physical-tied-to-mobile fitness products, combining mobile app training with a physical retail product. LifeApps® is developing a suite of software tools and enhanced customer experiences that will enable the Company to scale the LifeApps Mobile App Platform through technology enhancements.
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy of purchasing companies and developing resources and assets that are aligned with our areas of interest can further aid in our entering additional market segments. We intend to actively research and engage in the acquisition of companies and resources that can expedite our entrance into new markets or strengthen our position in existing ones.
Competition
 
The development, distribution and sale of digital publications and apps is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For end users, we compete primarily on the basis of quality, brand, customer reviews and price. We compete for promotional and deck placement based on these factors, as well as the relationship with the digital storefront owner or wireless carrier, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners or carriers. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.
 
With respect to digital publications and apps that we publish for smartphones and tablets, we compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Meredith Publishing, WebMD and many well-funded private companies. We also compete for consumer spending with large companies, such as NIKE and Electronic Arts. In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch digital publications and apps and other content for these mobile devices utilizing relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for end users who purchase content for their smartphones and tablets without substantially increasing spending to market our products or increasing our development costs.

Convertible Loans
 
On November 9, 2015 an individual (the “Lender”) made an unsecured convertible loan to LifeApps Brands Inc. (the “Company”) due and payable on March 21, 2016, in the principal amount of $25,000 bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The loan was evidenced in writing by the Company and the Lender when made and was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) at a price of $0.75 per share. On October 27, 2016 the Company and the Lender entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement in which they agreed to revise the conversion price from $0.75 per share to $0.0055 per share, which was the closing sale price for the Common Stock on October 27, 2016 and to convert the principal amount of the loan at the revised conversion price into 4,545,455 shares of Common Stock. In consideration of the revised conversion terms, the Lender agreed to waive the accrued interest due on the loan.
 
On April 5, 2016 the Lender made an unsecured loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15,000 bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The loan was evidenced in writing by the Company and the Lender on October 27, 2016 at which time the parties determined that the loan, including the accrued interest due thereon, be due and payable on April 5, 2017 (the “Maturity Date”) and that it be convertible into Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.0055 per share which was the closing price for the Common Stock on October 27, 2016.
 
FemCap Acquisition
 
On May 21, 2016, we and FemCap Inc. (“FemCap”) entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) providing for the exclusive right for a 90-day period for us to purchase FemCap, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement. Under the Agreement, we had a 90-day exclusive right to purchase FemCap’s operating assets used to market and sell FemCap™ and FemmyCycle® feminine hygiene products. Such operating assets included molds, equipment, contract rights, customer lists, leases, accounting records and intellectual property. We were not able to complete the purchase of FemCap within the 90 day timeline and determined not to proceed further with the transaction.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in them being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.

We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users. We currently collect certain personally identifiable information regarding our customers, and expect in the future to collect additional personally identifiable information regarding our customers. Any concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. We post our privacy policy and our terms of service on our corporate website. In these policies, we describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of the information that we collect regarding our users. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the mobile gaming industry is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.
 
In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We sometimes offer our customers various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.
 
In addition, the advertisers that advertise with our apps are subject to Federal Trade Commission and state rules on advertising and marketing on the Internet, including truth-in advertising rules, online advertising disclosures and the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) of 2003.  To date, we have not been materially impacted by these rules because our platforms are designed to ensure that proper disclosures are made in connection with every publication.  We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or advertisers that advertise with our apps.
 
Further, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 2 employees, all of whom are full time employees.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Properties
 
Our principal executive office is located at Polo Plaza, 3790 Via De La Valle #116, Del Mar, CA 92014 and our telephone number is (858) 577-0500. The property is currently being rented on a month to month basis at a rate of $715 per month.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations.  Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions, administrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Available Information
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  Reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, including annual and quarterly reports, and other reports we file, can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Investors may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
