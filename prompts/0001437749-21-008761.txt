OUR GROWTH STRATEGY
 
QAD believes there are substantial growth opportunities in our cloud business. Global manufacturers are facing unprecedented levels of disruption and turbulence. COVID-19, as an example, has accelerated digital transformation. Responding to these changes requires a level of agility that legacy ERP solutions fail to deliver. QAD's Adaptive ERP offers greater fit out of the box, rapid deployment and the ability to easily adapt and extend systems to meet the challenge of accelerating change.
 
Our growth strategy is supported by the following key priorities:
 
Dominate disrupted markets for new cloud customer acquisitions. The accelerating pace of change in our customers’ markets has created a disconnect between their business requirements and what their systems are able to support. Legacy ERP systems were not designed to support today’s rapid pace of change. The QAD Enterprise Platform was designed to provide greater fit and flexibility to meet tomorrow’s requirements. As such, disruption in our customers’ markets becomes a compelling reason for changing their ERP systems and one that we are well positioned to address. We selected three strategic areas with the greatest disruption to actively pursue new customers where we can provide the best product fit. These areas, called Strategic Business Segments, include: Automotive, Life Sciences and Packaging.  Over the last several years we have increased our investment in sales, marketing and lead generation activities to facilitate new customer acquisition growth. 
 
Grow our cloud business and expand our footprint within existing customers. We believe there is substantial opportunity to grow our cloud-based enterprise solutions within our global manufacturing customer base. Our cloud solutions allow our customers to focus on their products and services without the distraction of administering their enterprise applications or maintaining their infrastructure. With approximately 75% of our users currently on-premises, we have many opportunities to increase cloud revenue across our existing installed base by converting our on-premises customers to our cloud-based solution, selling additional modules and users to our existing cloud customers, extending our existing offerings and reducing customer attrition by delivering an excellent customer experience.
 
Deliver continuous product development and rapid response to change.  Manufacturers are facing a swiftly-changing business environment fueled by exponential growth in underlying technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing), Blockchain, Augmented Reality and Predictive Analytics. Collectively these technologies are driving trends such as digital transformation and smart manufacturing. We believe delivering a focused, flexible ERP system will be increasingly attractive to pragmatic manufacturers seeking a long-term fit of their business systems in support of their digital strategies in changing markets. We are committed to continuous investment in product development, our platform and advanced technologies to ensure our products have the necessary capabilities to meet the needs of our global customers and enhance our competitive position in the vertical markets we serve.
 
Focus on global manufacturing and leverage expertise within key vertical markets. Many manufacturers operate globally, requiring a provider that can tailor solutions to the unique needs of their markets, deliver local and global professional services resources and support local languages. Solutions must be cost effective and easy to implement and use. Our solutions offer many benefits to customers with global operations, including capabilities that support operations in multiple geographies with a variety of languages and currencies, as well as compliance with complex local regulations and business practices. We also employ people with specific knowledge and experience in the industries in which our customers operate. We provide our solutions to 23 sectors across six vertical manufacturing markets and we actively participate in several leading industry associations. In addition, our industry knowledge continues to deepen through regular interaction with our customers. This collective experience allows QAD to develop solutions with specific capabilities that address our customers’ needs in the industries they serve.
 
Expand our global partner ecosystem. We currently sell a majority of our software solutions and services directly. We also sell our software solutions and services indirectly via sales agents, distributors and services partners. We are focused on expanding our indirect sales channels. Our global partner strategy goals are to generate revenue growth through expanded sales reach and strengthened strategic positioning; sustainably grow coverage in core vertical markets and sectors; develop processes to maintain profitable operations for QAD and our partners; grow partner competencies and capabilities to address evolving customer needs through holistic enablement and collaborative relationship; enhance and augment lead generation and pipeline growth through collaboration and partner success management; and broaden coverage and increase capacity through partner ecosystem growth.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
Our customers have to deal with increasing levels of change, uncertainty and complexity on a continuous basis. From compliance factors to digital transformation, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical issues; global manufacturers need to be agile in extreme circumstances. In 2020, these challenges were exemplified by the business disruptions caused by COVID-19. Our customers had to adapt their business models to deal with social distancing, supply shortages and increased costs. Dealing with these challenges from a solution and technology perspective is what drives the vision for our products.
 
We maintain a global research and development organization that provides new product functionality to the market on a semiannual basis. In addition, our Internationalization effort incorporates regulatory changes, on an as required basis to satisfy country requirements. This approach to new product functionality enables us to respond quickly to industry disruptions and regulatory changes. 
 
Our primary focus for development is to build our products in support of our SaaS direction. With SaaS solutions, customers expect that their software is kept up to date as part of the offering and that security is continuously being verified and updated to guard against security breaches. With every release, we perform routine security checks of the software to ensure our software is secure. In fiscal 2021, we released a major upgrade to our software suite that delivered supply chain efficiencies, deeper integration into shop floor operations and deeper reporting of manufacturing activities. We also delivered a new CRM app for manufacturers that gives our customers a full 360-degree view of their customer interactions. Our latest agile manufacturing module and production planning and scheduling functions are now fully integrated into the shop floor execution and reporting processes.

QAD dedicates considerable technical and financial resources to R&D to continually enhance and expand our product suite, including through our Internationalization program focused on legal compliance for our global customers operating across borders. We continue to see the global trend toward electronic invoicing and registration of shipments and invoices with government agencies to prevent falsification and tax evasion expand across the world. We strive to support our customers through these changes without interruption to their businesses using our software to assist them in meeting the legal requirements of the countries in which they do business.
 
Our global R&D organization consists of 475 employees primarily located in the United States, Ireland, China, India, Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Belgium, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Poland, and Brazil. We believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development at lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities. While our software is primarily developed internally, we also use independent companies and contractors to perform some of our product development activities when we require additional resources or specific skills or knowledge. All outside development is overseen by our internal R&D organization.
 
We also acquire products or technology developed by others, as needed, by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties. We continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining enough competitive advantage to justify their costs. We routinely translate our product suite into fourteen languages. Our development focus is on cloud deployments first, hence, some functionality that is available to our cloud customers may not be available to our on-premises customers on the same timeframe, if at all, or may have an additional fee associated with it.

QAD sells its products and services through direct and indirect sales channels located throughout the regions of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific and Latin America. Each region leverages global standards and systems to enhance consistency when interacting with global customers. Additionally, we have global account teams and strategic business teams focused on sectors facing the greatest level of disruption where we can provide the greatest product fit.
 
The Company’s direct sales organization includes approximately 68 commissioned salespeople.  Supporting our commissioned salespeople are vertical market experts, business development representatives, business consultants, pre-sales employees responsible for leading demonstrations of our software solutions, and customer service representatives supporting our existing customers.
 
Incentive pay is a significant portion of the total compensation package for our sales staff. We continually align our sales organization and business strategies with market conditions to maintain an effective sales process. We cultivate the industries we serve within each territory through marketing, local product development and sales training.
 
MARKETING
 
The QAD marketing strategy is to differentiate our offerings by focusing on our role in enabling manufacturers to overcome the change and uncertainty they face and to support them in achieving the vision of the Adaptive Manufacturing Enterprise. We do this by highlighting QAD’s next generation Adaptive ERP and its five rapid response technologies that deliver greater fit for today and the flexibility to meet tomorrow’s business requirements.
 
We target sectors within our primary verticals facing the greatest disruption, where we can provide the best fit and support those companies with the greatest need.
 
Our main marketing objectives are to leverage the measurable success in business outcomes our customers have achieved and highlight hidden costs prospects may face with legacy ERP, to increase awareness and drive leads in target sectors. We do this by openly and consistently communicating with QAD customers, prospects, partners, investors and other key audiences. Our primary marketing activities include:
 

● | Account based marketing (ABM) for targeting, assessing buying intent, and display advertising
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Influencer Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company offerings and value proposition
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical and virtual user conferences and events, such as Explore, as well as participation in other industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Content marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Search engine optimization and focused retargeting
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Website development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through a deep understanding of the challenges manufactures face and how our solutions can help to overcome them
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Customer testimonials, references, and referrals
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We recognize that buying dynamics are changing and we are focused on engaging with prospects early in the sales cycle to help set the buying criteria and specifications in a way that uniquely leads to QAD. We seek to accelerate prospects through the buying journey by demonstrating the value of our products, answering questions and removing roadblocks. A prospect’s successful implementation of enterprise solutions is typically embedded in a larger change management project. The decision to buy enterprise solutions is, in part, based on a prospect’s belief they can be successful in their change management efforts. We are increasing our scope beyond the enterprise solution to increase the prospect’s confidence in their ability to overcome change management challenges in an effort to increase win rates and reduce “no decision” outcomes.
 
A critical role of marketing is to bring the voice of the customer into QAD. Vertical and Solutions Marketing work directly with customers and R&D to drive a market-driven roadmap resulting in products that deliver greater value, making them easier to market and sell.
 
Corporate Marketing supports our regional and strategic business marketing teams, working closely with their respective business development and sales teams.
 
COMPETITION
 
Our business is affected by strong competition from both enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application services providers. The markets for our offerings are rapidly evolving, highly competitive and are subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new applications. Our customers demand greater performance and reliability with lower complexity. Fit, cost, speed, and flexibility are primary criteria in our customers’ decision-making processes.
 
We compete with large, well-established enterprise application vendors, such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, among others, who hold significant market share in the traditional ERP marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources and name recognition, and have established broad market solutions by developing applications targeted at many industries, not just manufacturing. Internationally, we face competition from local companies, as well as the large enterprise application competitors, many of which have products tailored for those local markets. Certain modules and functionality included in our ERP offering may also compete with cloud solutions and software companies providing a point solution.
 
Most enterprise application vendors today have some focus on cloud solutions, in addition to on-premises sales, which creates an environment in which we face competition from a variety of vendors that address one or more of our applications. As a result, our cloud solutions compete with both large enterprise software vendors and cloud computing application service providers. In addition, other vendors that provide services in different markets may develop solutions in our target markets and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal solutions.
 
We believe the key competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | Solution fit, breadth and functionality
--+----------------------------------------


● | Flexibility, integration, security and scalability
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Speed and ease of initial deployment and version upgrades
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Total cost of ownership
--+------------------------


● | Performance and reliability
--+----------------------------


● | Technological innovation and ability to respond to customer needs rapidly
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reputation of the vendor
--+-------------------------


● | Customer satisfaction
--+----------------------

To continue our market success, we must respond promptly and effectively to technological change and competitors’ innovation. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our efforts in the areas of product development and sales, services and support operations.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL
 
As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,930 full-time employees, including 805 in support, subscription and professional services, 475 in research and development, 375 in sales and marketing and 275 in administration. Generally, our employees are not represented by collective bargaining agreements. However, certain employees in our Dutch, French and Italian subsidiaries are represented by statutory works councils as required under local law. Employees of our Brazilian subsidiary are represented by a collective bargaining agreement with the Data Processing Union.
 
Our employees play a central role in the success of our long-term strategy. Our values — Driving for Results, Doing the Right Thing, Extreme Ownership, Commit to the Team, and Challenge the Status Quo — are built on the foundation that our people and the way we treat one another promote inclusion, creativity, innovation and productivity, which drives the company’s success. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive inclusion, equity, and diversity.  In 2020, we launched QAD’s Inclusion and Diversity program (I&D). As a company, QAD has always endeavored to create a work environment where employees could bring their entire selves to work and perform at their very best. Through our I&D strategy we are formalizing our approach to inclusiveness and building upon our values to ensure we focus on maintaining a high performance culture that maximizes and leverages the unique skills and talents of every employee across our enterprise.
 
We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. To ensure alignment with our short-term and long-term goals, our compensation programs for employees include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance; generous time-off and leave; and retirement programs. We provide emotional, physical, legal and financial well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program. Our emotional well-being support offers help with a wide range of issues including stress management, work/life balance, grief and loss, self-esteem and personal development. In addition, our financial education and financial wellness coaches offer employees tools and resources to reach their personal financial goals.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These changes include having the vast majority of our employees work from home until the pandemic eases, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work during the pandemic. We have also added several company-wide paid days off and caregiving support to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and we maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information.
SEASONALITY
 
Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and maintenance renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see the “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow” discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.
