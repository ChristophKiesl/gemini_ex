Overview
Our operations are organized into two segments: 
Aerospace and Defense — includes the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc. ("Aerojet Rocketdyne"), a leading technology-based designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the United States ("U.S.") government, including the Department of Defense ("DoD"), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA"), and major aerospace and defense prime contractors. 
Real Estate — includes the activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary Easton Development Company, LLC ("Easton") related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We are currently in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on our excess real estate assets. 
On December 20, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Lockheed Martin and Mizar Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the Company being the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $56.00 per share, without interest, less, to the extent paid or payable as outlined below, the amount per share of the Pre-Closing Dividend (defined below). 
On December 19, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per share (including shares underlying the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes ("2¼% Notes") participating on an as-converted basis) (the "Pre-Closing Dividend"). The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021, to the holders of our shares and 2¼% Notes as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. The $56.00 per share price under the Merger Agreement is expected to be reduced to $51.00 after the payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to our stockholders and holders of our 2¼% Notes participating on an as-converted basis (or, in the unlikely event that closing occurs after March 10, 2021, but before March 24, 2021, to the extent the Pre-Closing Dividend is payable after the closing).
Closing of the Merger is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2021, subject to various customary conditions, including our stockholder approval and regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. 
Aerospace and Defense 
Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized technology-based engineering and manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized power and propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. We develop and manufacture liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines, and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Principal customers and end users include the DoD (including the U.S. Air Force ("USAF"), U.S. Space Force, U.S. Army, Missile Defense Agency ("MDA"), and U.S. Navy), NASA, The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies Corporation ("Raytheon"), and United Launch Alliance ("ULA"). 
We have demonstrated a legacy of successfully meeting the most challenging missions by producing some of the world’s most technologically advanced propulsion systems to meet our nation's critical needs. We believe we maintain a unique competitive position due to our strategic focus on creating and maintaining a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for our innovative energy management technologies. The highly reliable nature of our revenue comes from the long-term nature of the programs with which we are involved, our attractive contract base and our deep customer relationships. High renewal rates, supported by our market leading technology provide us with a highly stable business base from which to grow. As of December 31, 2020, our remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $6.7 billion and our funded backlog, which includes only amounts for which funding has been authorized by a customer and a purchase order has been received, totaled $3.0 billion. 
Primary Markets and Programs 
The markets and key programs we serve are: 
Aerospace. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion and power systems for space applications. Our products include a broad market offering of both electric and chemical propulsion, including liquid propellant engines and solid rocket motors, required for launch vehicle and in-space applications supporting defense, civil and commercial missions.
Our space products have a long, successful flight heritage with the U.S. government and we continue to provide strong support of National Security Space requirements enabling communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ("ISR") missions. We provide first stage and upper stage liquid propulsion for ULA’s Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle as well as the liquid upper stage propulsion for the Atlas V launch vehicle in support of the National Security Space Launch ("NSSL") program. During 2020, the U.S. Space Force selected ULA as one of two launch service providers under the NSSL Phase 2 Launch Services Procurement ("LSP") with its new Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle and we will supply two RL10 upper stage engines to ULA for each Vulcan Centaur mission. 
We continue to support the exploration of deep space. During 2020, NASA made significant progress in returning the U.S. to the Moon with the Artemis program and we are a critical contributor to multiple elements of this historic endeavor. This year, NASA began a series of final tests on the core stage of the Space Launch System ("SLS") Artemis I rocket, powered by our RS-25 liquid rocket engines. During 2020, we also completed all hardware for the first crewed flight of NASA’s SLS rocket and Orion crew module, Artemis II. Additionally, in 2020, we were awarded a follow-on contract from NASA for $1.8 billion to deliver 18 RS-25 engines to power the SLS heavy-lift exploration rocket, bringing the total number of new RS-25s on order to 24. 
In support of Low Earth Orbit human spaceflight initiatives, astronauts installed the final sets of our Lithium-Ion ("Li-Ion") batteries into the International Space Station’s ("ISS") power system in 2020. Over the course of this three and half year endeavor a total of 24 of our Li-Ion batteries replaced the 48 obsolete nickel hydrogen batteries. In addition, we supply critical propulsion hardware for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft for NASA, which will usher in a new era of commercial human spaceflight by ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS for NASA. 
In the commercial market, we provide in-space propulsion products to major U.S. commercial satellite manufacturers. Our in-space propulsion products and systems also support critical U.S. government and civil spacecraft programs. 
We are playing a critical role in NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, launched in July 2020. The Perseverance Rover ("Perseverance") relies on our propulsion systems during launch, entry, descent, and landing phases of the mission. Additionally, while operating on the Mars surface, Perseverance will be powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne-supplied Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. 
Also in 2020, we delivered our dual chemical and electric propulsion system for NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test ("DART") spacecraft which will be the first demonstration of a kinetic impactor striking an asteroid at high speed in order to change the asteroids motion in space. 
We continued to mature critical technologies for our nation’s next generation of advanced hydrocarbon engines for future high-performance launch systems. In February 2016, the USAF awarded Aerojet Rocketdyne a Rocket Propulsion System Other Transaction Agreement ("OTA"), a public-private partnership, to develop the AR1 engine. Following the decision by the Launch Services Program competitors not to incorporate the AR1 in their new launch vehicle designs, we signed a modification to the existing OTA to design, build, and assemble only one AR1 engine. The assembly of the AR1 engine was completed in 2020. 
A subset of our key space programs include: (i) RL10 and RS-68 engines/boosters that power the NSSL program, (ii) RS-25 main and RL10 upper stage engines that power NASA’s SLS heavy-lift rocket for deep space exploration, (iii) propulsion for the Orion human spacecraft and the Starliner Commercial Crew Transportation Capability capsule, (iv) power systems for ISS and science missions, and (v) multiple in-space electric and chemical propulsion systems to provide orbit raising and satellite positioning.
Defense. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense applications including both solid and liquid propellant based systems, along with air-breathing (ramjet and hypersonic scramjet) systems for missile applications. The majority of these systems are the primary axial propulsion for missile systems. We also develop and manufacture liquid and solid divert and attitude control ("DACs") propulsion systems for missile defense applications. These are complex systems that provide multi-directional thrust and variable thrust levels to steer or control an intercept missile. Additionally, we develop and manufacture post-boost propulsion systems for strategic missiles. These systems provide directional control for ground and sea-based strategic missiles. Using our energetics expertise we also design, develop, and produce warhead/lethality systems for tactical missiles. Our tactical armament products have been successfully fielded on multiple active U.S. and international weapon system platforms. The breadth of our products includes tactical missiles, missile defense interceptors, hypersonic systems and strategic boosters and post-boost systems for a variety of applications.
During 2020, we continued to expand our strong legacy propulsion franchises on the Standard Missile, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 ("PAC-3"), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD") and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ("GMLRS") missile programs, to include Raytheon awarding a five-year, $1 billion strategic agreement to address Standard Missile propulsion products. These franchise programs continue to be globally deployed in support of U.S. and allied armed forces. 
In the hypersonic propulsion arena, we continued to advance the state of the art of air-breathing scramjet engines with tests that achieved record thrust levels in simulated hypersonic flight conditions. Our work on complementary air-breathing propulsion (ramjet/scramjet) for hypersonic missiles continued in 2020 with the completion of flight-ready engines.
In 2020, we were selected to develop a large solid rocket motor and the post-boost propulsion system for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent ("GBSD") program as a key member of Northrop Grumman Corporation's ("Northrop") nationwide GBSD team. Northrop was selected by the U.S. Air Force as the prime contractor for GBSD’s Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase. Additionally, we continued to expand our portfolio of propulsion products with development contract awards that included (i) the U.S. Navy advanced propulsion system – Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System for the MK 54 Advanced Lightweight Torpedo and (ii) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA") propulsion technologies for the Glide Breaker hypersonic defense interceptor.
Finally, in 2020, our Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace ("Coleman") business continued to expand its scope on the medium-range ballistic missile ("MRBM") target program with the development of new subsystems that will allow target simulation of significantly more advanced threats.
A subset of our key defense programs include: (i) Boosters and Solid DACs for the Navy’s Standard Missile family, (ii) Booster and Liquid DACs for THAAD, (iii) PAC-3, (iv) GMLRS, (v) Stinger, (vi) Javelin, (vii) Tactical Tomahawk, (viii) Army Tactical Missile Systems ("ATACMS"), (ix) Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided ("TOW") warhead, and (x) HAWK.
Information concerning the percentage of net sales attributable to our significant programs appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Competition 
The competitive dynamics of our business vary by product type and customer, but we experience many of the same challenges as the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely difficult or hazardous to build, which require rigorous manufacturing systems and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (such as additive manufacturing) are enabling new entrants with the funding to enter this industry, leading to increased competition. To date, competition from new entrants has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, competitors such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have developed liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for space launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion products that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new competitors have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are willing to take on substantial risk exposure on development programs with unproven market potential and are, therefore, disrupting existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies. For the in-space propulsion market, we also see a number of new startups entering the market in both small chemical propulsion and small electric propulsion systems targeted at the rapidly expanding small satellite market.
The following table lists the primary participants in the propulsion market (in alphabetical order):

Parent Company | Propulsion Type 
Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. | Solid, liquid, air-breathing, electric
ArianeGroup | Solid, liquid, electric 
Avio S.p.A | Solid, liquid 
Busek Co. Inc. | Electric 
Blue Origin | Liquid 
General Dynamics | Solid 
IHI Aerospace | Liquid, electric 
Moog Inc. | Liquid 
Nammo Talley | Solid, liquid 
Northrop Grumman Corporation | Solid, liquid, air-breathing 
Safran | Electric 
SpaceX | Liquid, electric 

Industry Overview 
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include DoD, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We rely on U.S. government funding for aerospace and defense and our backlog depends, in large part, on the continued funding by the U.S. government for these programs. While U.S. and state governments continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers are operating under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260), which appropriated funding to DoD and NASA for Government Fiscal Year 2021. Public Law 116-260 was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act included a section on COVID-19 relief and recovery that includes numerous policy provisions and an appropriation of about $900 billion in COVID-19 assistance funding. Disruptions to our customer’s facilities or delays in supply chain as a result of COVID-19 could delay or decrease expenditures by U.S. government 
agencies. Such a decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
Major Customers 
Information concerning major customers appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Contract Types 
Research and development ("R&D") contracts are awarded during the early stages of a program’s development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature products for operational use. Our contracts are largely categorized as either "fixed-price" (largely used by the U.S. government for production-type contracts) or "cost-reimbursable" (largely used by the U.S. government for development-type contracts). During 2020, approximately 61% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts and 39% from cost-reimbursable contracts. 
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) firm fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price level of effort contracts. For firm fixed-price contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs during contract performance. For fixed-price-incentive fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives increased or decreased fees (or profits) based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the customer’s labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in lower than expected contract profit margin and losses. 
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne typically receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared with contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule. 
In addition, OTA contracts are becoming more prevalent in the developmental stages of U.S. government procurements. An OTA is a special vehicle used by federal agencies for obtaining or advancing R&D or prototypes. The U.S. government's procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to OTAs, and accordingly, other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to a particular transaction. Generally, our sales and backlog figures do not include work we have under contracts obligated by the customer under an OTA as our share of the contract costs are recognized as company-funded R&D. 
Government Contracts and Regulations 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), agency-specific regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to U.S. government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustments, mandatory disclosure, and audit requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to routine audits, reviews, and investigations by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other similar U.S. government agencies. Such reviews include but are not limited to our contract performance, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards as well as the review of the adequacy of our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting systems. 
The U.S. government’s ability to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination. 
Additional information about the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Backlog 
Information concerning backlog appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Backlog." 
Seasonality 
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business is not subject to predictable seasonality. Primary factors affecting the timing of our sales include the timing of U.S. government awards, the availability of U.S. government funding, contractual product delivery requirements, and customer acceptances. 
Research and Development
We view R&D efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we compete. Our R&D is primarily supported by customer funding. Our company-funded R&D efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes. See Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on R&D expenditures.
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances beyond our control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to our program performance and cost. 
 Availability of raw materials and supplies has been generally sufficient. We sometimes are dependent, for a variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and have, in some instances in the past, experienced difficulties meeting production and delivery obligations because of delays in delivery or reliance on such suppliers. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often limited to procuring materials from certain suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. 
Additional information about the risks relating to suppliers and raw materials appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Intellectual Property 
Where appropriate, Aerojet Rocketdyne obtains patents in the U.S. and other countries for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures or compositions of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof relating to its products and services. Our patents are maintained through the statutory limit of time, which is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application, where the claimed invention has value in the markets in which we compete. We rely on trade secret protection for financial, technical and personnel information that provides an economic competitive advantage by virtue of not being known by the relevant public and ordinarily require employees to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition to employment. If properly protected, trade secrets can be maintained in perpetuity. Aerojet Rocketdyne takes reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of its trade secrets in order to maintain protection under applicable state and federal laws. As our products and services typically embody complex systems that include many technologies, we do not believe any single existing patent, license, or trade secret is material to our success.
Real Estate 
We own 11,394 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento ("Sacramento Land"). Acquired in the early 1950s and historically used for our aerospace and defense operations, large portions were used solely to provide safe buffer zones around hazardous operations. Modern changes in propulsion technology coupled with the relocation of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to re-entitle the Sacramento Land for new uses and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.
The Sacramento Land is made up of 5,203 acres previously used for our aerospace and defense operations, 628 acres available for future entitlement, and 5,563 acres for future development under the brand name "Easton". Easton has 3,904 acres that are fully entitled. The term "entitlement" is generally used to denote the required set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each jurisdiction and each zoning proposal and may include permits, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others prior to construction. 
As Easton continues to execute re-entitlement and pre-development activities, we are pursuing a variety of monetization options and are exploring how to maximize value from Easton. Value creation and monetization may include outright land sales and/or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders, and/or other third parties. We believe the long-term prospect for the Sacramento region represents an attractive and affordable alternative to the San Francisco Bay Area and other large metropolitan areas of California. 
The following table summarizes the Sacramento Land (in acres): 

 | EnvironmentallyUnrestricted | EnvironmentallyRestricted (1) | | Total | Entitled
Glenborough and Easton Place | 1,043 | | 349 | | 1,392 | 1,392
Rio del Oro | 1,818 | | 491 | | 2,309 | 2,309
Westborough | 1,387 | | 272 | | 1,659 | — 
Hillsborough (2) | 51 | | 97 | | 148 | 148 
Office Park and Auto Mall | 47 | | 8 | | 55 | 55 
Total Easton acreage | 4,346 | | 1,217 | | 5,563 | 3,904
Former operations land (3) | 24 | | 5,179 | | 5,203 | 
Land available for future entitlement (4) | 386 | | 242 | | 628 | 
Total Sacramento Land | 4,756 | | 6,638 | | 11,394 | 

_________
(1)    Indicates land subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 8(b) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land. 
(2) The remaining 148 acres designated in Hillsborough will be transferred, per the completed purchase and sale contract from 2015, when the required environmental remediation work is completed. 
(3)    In 2019, we completed our manufacturing commitments in our Sacramento, California facility and transitioned the Sacramento site to host our shared services function. 
(4)    We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time. 
Leasing 
We currently lease office space in Sacramento to various third parties that generated $3.3 million in revenue in 2020. 
Environmental Matters 
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations, and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Under existing U.S. environmental laws, Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"), are jointly and severally liable, and therefore we are potentially liable to the U.S. government or other third parties for the full cost of remediating the contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agencies. The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities requires significant management judgment to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs that may be required for remediation measures. Further, environmental standards change from time to time. However, we perform quarterly reviews of these matters and accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability, usually based on proportionate sharing, can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities have not been discounted to their present value as the amounts and timing of cash payments are not fixed or reliably determinable. 
On January 12, 1999, we reached a settlement agreement ("Global Settlement") with the U.S. government covering environmental costs associated with our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site. Pursuant to the Global Settlement, we can recover up to 88% of our environmental remediation costs through the establishment of prices for Aerojet Rocketdyne's products and services sold to the U.S. government. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the Electronics and Information Systems business in 2001, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into an agreement with Northrop (the "Northrop Agreement") whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual billing limitation of $6.0 million and a cumulative limitation of $189.7 million. 
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowed to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government. 
The inclusion of environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government impacts our competitive pricing; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.
We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2020 nor do we anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2021 and 2022. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7 "Environmental Matters" of this Report for additional information. 
Additional information on the risks related to environmental matters can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report, including the material effects on compliance with environmental regulations that may impact our competitive position and operating results. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, 8% of our 4,969 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and unions are good. Our workforce, along with their commitment to our values, provides the foundation of our Company’s success.
Human Capital Management
We believe our success depends on the strength of our workforce. Our integrated human capital management strategy includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent, as well as the design of compensation and benefits programs, to deliver on our strategy. 
Development - We enable our employees to reach their full potential by providing a wide range of career development and opportunities, skill development and resources they need to be successful. Our Rocket University learning platform supplements our talent development strategies and enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Our annual Succession Planning and Talent Management process is the formal identification and development of our next generation leaders and supports the development of our talent pipeline for key roles across the enterprise. We encourage advancement and movement across our organization to fill our open positions with strong and experienced management talent and individual contributors.
Inclusion, Diversity and Engagement ("ID&E") – We believe in the strength of engaged and diverse teams in an inclusive work environment to unleash the potential of our employees. Through the efforts of these diverse and collaborative teams, we seek to be on the cutting edge of technology and exceed customer expectations. We have established a corporate-wide ID&E council and a number of executive-sponsored employee resource groups ("ERG") across the enterprise, where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. Our ERGs support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally. To assess and improve employee engagement, we survey our employees and take actions to address areas of employee concern.
Health and Safety - Safety is one of our core values. We are committed to a safe work environment for our employees as well as being good stewards of the natural environment. Like many companies, the COVID-19 pandemic has been especially challenging as we focused our health and safety efforts on protecting our employees and their families from potential COVID-19 exposure while delivering excellent performance to our customers. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed plans and taken focused actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect, manage, and communicate with our employees to contain the impacts of COVID-19.
