Item 1. Business.
Our Corporate History



We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 29, 1988 under the name Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. On April 27, 2004, the Company changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc. On April 13, 2006, the Company changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc., and on May 5, 2006, the Company reincorporated in Nevada. On March 15, 2012, the Company changed its name to DiMi Telematics International, Inc.



In early 2017, we re-focused our business attention to the hemp-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, market. On March 10, 2017, the Company changed its name to Bespoke Extracts, Inc. to align the Company’s corporate identity with its new business plan. 



Since 2017, the Company has focused on selling its proprietary line of specially-formulated, premium quality, hemp-derived CBD products direct to consumers through our ecommerce store, found at www.bespokeextracts.com. Information on our website is not part of this report.



Under our expanded operating plan, we intend to methodically expand our product offerings to include new flavors, including manuka honey; and introduce additional form factors for our CBD formulations, including lotions and balms, depending on customer feedback and evolving consumer demand.



Recent Developments



In November 2021, new management of the Company was appointed and the Company began to focus on other complimentary lines of business to its CBD offerings. Under our new management team, we plan to expand the Company’s focus to regulated cannabis markets in the United States.



The Company’s expanded business plan may include the acquisition of licensed medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries, cultivation facilities and production facilities in states which allow publicly traded companies to own and operate such businesses. Depending on the markets entered and state regulation, the Company’s plan may also include: asset purchases, management/consulting operating agreements, or similar agreements. The Company plans to use a combination of cash, shares of common or preferred stock, notes, or other financing vehicles to complete these acquisitions. There is no assurance any required financing for such acquisitions will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we will complete any such acquisitions.

In addition, the acquisition of marijuana dispensaries and cultivation/manufacturing/processing facilities is subject to the approval of government authorities which license and regulate marijuana dispensaries in their applicable jurisdictions. No assurance can be given that any such approvals can be obtained.



Wonderleaf



The Company has developed a plan to potentially acquire and merge, or “roll up” direct plant-touching dispensaries, manufacturing facilities, and cannabis cultivations with a target to be one of the highest quality, craft cannabis, seed-to-sale businesses in Colorado.



Consistent with this strategy, on December 2, 2021, Bespoke Extracts Colorado, LLC (“Bespoke Colorado”), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with WonderLeaf, LLC (“WonderLeaf”), and on December 7, 2021, Bespoke Colorado and WonderLeaf entered into an amendment to such asset purchase agreement (as amended, the “Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement, Bespoke Colorado agreed to purchase from WonderLeaf, and WonderLeaf agreed to sell to Bespoke Colorado, certain assets of WonderLeaf, including a license to manufacture marijuana-infused products, existing inventory, and extraction equipment and ancillary items, all as further set forth in the Purchase Agreement.



In connection with the Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement, Bespoke Colorado entered into a lease agreement (the “Lease”) with WL Holdings, Ltd. (“WL Holdings”) Pursuant to the Lease, Bespoke Colorado will lease from WL Holdings certain commercial space in Aurora, Colorado, where WonderLeaf’s business has been located, commencing upon signing of the Lease and Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement, for a term of five years, which Bespoke Colorado will have an option to renew for an additional five years.



Closing of the Wonderleaf Purchase Agreement is subject to receipt of certain governmental approvals and other customary closing conditions.



Our Business--Overview 



Since the change in management and control of the Company that occurred in November 2021, we now primarily operate within the regulated cannabis industry and the CBD industry with three divisions: i) consulting and professional services, which we plan to commence offering around January 2022; (ii) the sale of CBD products through our websites; and (iii) a new business division called “Bespoke Extracts Colorado, LLC,” which, upon closing of the Wonderleaf acquisition, will be a licensed owner/operator of recreational marijuana processing facilities located in Colorado.

 The Hemp-Derived CBD Market



In 2014, President Barack Obama signed the 2014 Farm Bill, which essentially allowed for hemp to be grown by permitted universities and state departments of agriculture in the name of federally funded research – rather than as a commercial crop. Thereafter, pro-hemp legislation received increasingly favorable bipartisan support, culminating in December 2018 with the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed industrial hemp from its listing as a Schedule I drug and recognizes hemp as an agricultural commodity, such as corn, wheat or soybeans. Consequently, demand for hemp-derived CBD products significantly increased, with the Federal government asserting certain oversight and compliance controls. Specifically, the production of hemp-derived CBD must adhere to certain regulatory mandates relating to the hemp grown to produce it, including:




● | The hemp must contain less than 0.3% THC; 
--+----------------------------------------------


● | The hemp must adhere to the shared state-federal regulations; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The hemp must be grown by a properly licensed grower. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------




In addition, the 2018 Farm Bill also lifted restrictions on the sale, transportation and possession of hemp-derived CBD products and allows for the transportation of hemp-derived CBD products across state lines, as long as the products comply with the aforementioned mandates.



Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of 140 identified cannabinoids, or plant compounds, found in cannabis species, namely Cannabis sativa (hemp plant) and Cannabis indica (marijuana plant). THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is also a natural occurring cannabinoid in these plants.



Numerous medical studies have found that cannabinoids, including CBD and THC, provide a wealth of health and wellness benefits through their interaction with the human endocannabinoid system (ECS), a complex network of cell receptors and neurotransmitters that help maintain the body’s homeostasis. According to one study, “modulating the ECS activity may have therapeutic potential in almost all diseases affecting humans, including obesity/metabolic syndrome, diabetes and diabetic complications, neuro-degenerative inflammatory, cardiovascular, liver, gastrointestinal, skin diseases, pain, psychiatric disorders, cachexia, cancer, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, among many others.” (Source: Pál Pacher and George Kunos, “Modulating the Endocannabinoid System in Human Health and Disease--Successes and Failures,” The FEBS Journal (U.S. National Library of Medicine, May 2013), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684164/.)

However, unlike CBD-based products which are non-psychoactive, have little to no side effects and are believed to offer tangible therapeutic benefits to its users, THC-based products used for recreational or medical purposes may induce psychotropic or euphoric effects on a user and have potential side effects, such as anxiety and paranoia. Another important distinction between the two is the fact that THC products can only be purchased in U.S. states which have legalized medical or recreational marijuana use, whereas authentic, hemp-derived CBD products may be legally purchased nationwide. In fact, today CBD products are being sold directly to consumers online by manufacturers and resellers and in many major and specialty retail stores, including Rite Aid, Walgreens, The Vitamin Shoppe, CVS, pet stores, beauty salons and even local convenience stores and gas stations.



CBD Product Line



Generally speaking, our management believes most CBD products for oral consumption available on the market have an earthy, bitter taste that some observers suggest is reminiscent of chlorophyll. The centerpiece of our retail product line will be our high quality products, formulated using only premium, organic ingredients. In addition to tinctures, we will also market CBD extract in capsule form, topicals, and gummies. We intend to expand our proprietary CBD products to include a broader range of flavors and form factors. Our current CBD offerings primarily focus on tinctures and liquid gels.
Supply, Manufacturing and Logistics



Our management believes that some companies operating in the CBD oil industry tend to emphasize sales and quantity over quality and safety. Over the past several years, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) has issued several warning letters to firms that market unapproved new drugs that allegedly contain CBD. As part of these actions, the FDA has tested the chemical content of cannabinoid compounds in some of the products, and many were found to not contain the levels of CBD they claimed to contain – several were found to have no CBD.



All our products are authenticated by an independent third party via issuance of a Certificate of Analysis (“COA”), for cannabinoid content and profile, microbiological content, heavy metal content, pesticide content, and residual solvent content. We recognize the importance of compliance and have partnered with one of the industry’s leading current good manufacturing practices, or CGMP certified extraction facilities. This ensures the consistency and quality of our product line and brand.



Made and derived from non-GMO, USA-grown hemp, our PCR hemp oil and isolate powder are subjected to a rigorous testing system – both in-house and verified through independent, third party labs – which ensures accurate levels of phytocannabinoids and confirms the levels of THC. Our products contain only the highest level of naturally derived CBD, more than 99.5% pure, and never contain more than 0.3% THC. We believe that a key differentiator of our finished products is the superb quality of ingredients we source from the industry’s leading suppliers, each of whom we have carefully vetted and qualified.



Fulfillment of orders from our online customers is managed by a well-established third-party logistics partner.



CBD Sales and Marketing



We currently sell our products through our website www.bespokecbd.com.



We believe that the traditional retail environment is currently experiencing notable economic instability due largely to the global shift in consumer purchasing behaviors – with online shopping/ecommerce sites overtaking brick-and-mortar stores as consumer preferred shopping venues. In view of this retailing reality, we have adopted a Direct-to-Consumer sales model that is anchored by an ecommerce website whereby we educate, sell and ship our CBD products directly to consumers. In addition, we also plan to market our CBD products on a wholesale basis to select specialty retailers, dispensaries and physicians.



Our marketing initiatives include the use of social marketing, social influence marketing, direct response marketing, inbound marketing, email marketing, Search Engine Optimization (“SEO”) and content marketing, among other proven strategies to generate and convert sales prospects into loyal, satisfied customers. We will also explore utilizing coupon and deal sites to drive traffic to our website and retailers, as well as participate in select industry conferences to promote our brand and build greater awareness of our products among prospective business partners and consumers.

The Difference Between Hemp and Marijuana



Both marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant called “Cannabis Sativa L.” However, cultivators of the cannabis plant have manipulated it over the years to encourage specific traits to become dominant. Cannabis plants contain unique compounds called cannabinoids. Current research has revealed over 80 different cannabinoids thus far, but management believes THC is the most well-known and is credited with causing the marijuana high. While marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, hemp contains very little of the psychoactive chemical. The foregoing is one of the differences which distinguishes hemp from marijuana. 



Scientifically, we now know that industrial hemp plants tend to produce high levels of the cannabinoid CBD, while producing low amounts of THC. Conversely, the marijuana plant produces high THC levels and low CBD levels. This chemical difference dictates the way we use the cannabis plant for medicinal and dietary supplemental purposes.



Cannabis Legislative Overview



Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we may become involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. Under the Company’s plan, the Company may be directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, and distribution of cannabis in the adult-use cannabis marketplace in the State of Colorado.



The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse; no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp.



The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical and recreational uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and consumers. Moreover, as of February 4, 2021 and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, although Mississippi’s medical cannabis legalization measure is under challenge. Fifteen of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure is subject to potential challenge. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized marijuana for medical use.

Unlike in Canada, which uniformly regulates the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana at the federal level under the Cannabis Act (Canada), marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in the states in which we plan to operate, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us. In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks.



Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of Department of Justice memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum. The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:




1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
---+----------------------------------------------------


2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
---+------------------------------------------------------------




On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.”



President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Attorney General Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a useful use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.



Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.

In order to participate in either the medical or recreational sides of the marijuana industry in Colorado and elsewhere, all businesses and employees must obtain badges and licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. Colorado issues six types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, transport, research license and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.



Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of marijuana businesses. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements and product testing for potency and contaminants.



Laws and regulations affecting the adult-use marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state, and federal adult-use marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.



Competition



We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we plan to operate. Our management team has significant experience in cultivation, processing and retailing of cannabis throughout regulated markets. As we execute on our strategy, we believe this expertise enables us to potentially evaluate, acquire and operate business efficiently.
Industry Knowledge. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has business expertise, extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge.



Regulatory Compliance. The state and local laws regulating the cannabis industry change at a rapid pace. We have resources committed to ensure our operations are in compliance with all state and local laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject. We apply this compliance knowledge to our customers in order to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance.



In the regulated cannabis industry, we believe we have significant competition from a range of private and public market participants. 



Given the rapid growth of the U.S. CBD and regulated cannabis industries, hundreds of companies have entered the respective markets. Consequently, the market is becoming highly competitive and we believe to compete in the market requires ensuring the quality and integrity of product offerings. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution, and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness than us, and there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully compete.
