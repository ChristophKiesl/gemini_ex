ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
 Ashland Global Holdings Inc. is a Delaware corporation, with its headquarters and principal executive offices at 8145 Blazer Drive, Wilmington, Delaware 19808 Telephone: (302) 995-3000. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. was incorporated in 2016 as the successor to a Kentucky corporation named Ashland Inc. organized in 2004 (now known as Ashland LLC), which was itself organized as the successor to a Kentucky corporation of the same name organized in 1936.

 MISCELLANEOUS
 Environmental Matters
 Ashland maintains a companywide environmental policy overseen by the Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality Committee of Ashland’s Board of Directors. Ashland’s Environmental, Health, Safety, Quality and Regulatory Affairs (EHSQ&RA) department has the responsibility to ensure that Ashland’s businesses worldwide maintain environmental compliance in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This responsibility is carried out via training; widespread communication of EHSQ&RA policies; information and regulatory updates; formulation of relevant policies, procedures and work practices; design and implementation of EHSQ&RA management systems; internal auditing; monitoring of legislative and regulatory developments that may affect Ashland’s operations; assistance to the businesses in identifying compliance issues and opportunities for voluntary actions that go beyond compliance; and incident response planning and implementation.
 Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment have a significant impact on how Ashland conducts its businesses. In addition, Ashland’s operations outside the United States are subject to the environmental laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include regulation of air emissions and water discharges, waste handling, remediation and product inventory, registration and regulation. New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.


At September 30, 2021, Ashland’s reserves for environmental remediation and related environmental litigation amounted to $207 million, reflecting Ashland’s best estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Engineering studies, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect Ashland’s ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately $480 million. No individual remediation location is significant, as the largest reserve for any site is 13% of the remediation reserve. Ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues. Environmental remediation expense, net of insurance receivables, amounted to $51 million in 2021 compared to $48 million in 2020 and $34 million in 2019.
 Product Control, Registration and Inventory - Many of Ashland’s products and operations are subject to chemical control laws of the countries in which they are located. These laws include regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulation in Europe. Under REACH, additional testing requirements, documentation, risk assessments and registrations are occurring and will continue to occur and may adversely affect Ashland’s costs of products produced in or imported into the European Union. Examples of other product control regulations include right to know laws under the Global Harmonized System (GHS) for hazard communication, regulation of chemicals used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and that contact food under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in the United States, the Framework Regulation in Europe and other product control requirements for chemical weapons, drug precursors and import/export. New laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted by various regulatory agencies globally. The costs of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been more precisely defined.
 Remediation - Ashland currently operates, and in the past has operated, various facilities at which, during the normal course of business, releases of hazardous substances have occurred. Additionally, Ashland has known or alleged potential environmental liabilities at a number of third-party sites. Federal and state laws, including but not limited to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and various other remediation laws, require that contamination caused by hazardous substance releases be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards. Some of these laws also provide for liability for related damage to natural resources, and claims for alleged property and personal injury damage can also arise related to contaminated sites. Laws in other jurisdictions in which Ashland operates require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and, if necessary, remediated to meet applicable standards.
 Air - In the United States, the Clean Air Act (CAA) imposes stringent limits on facility air emissions, establishes a federally mandated operating permit program, allows for civil and criminal enforcement actions and sets limits on the volatile or toxic content of many types of industrial materials and consumer products. The CAA establishes national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) with attainment deadlines and control requirements based on the severity of air pollution in a given geographical area. Various state clean air acts implement, complement and, in many instances, add to the requirements of the federal CAA. The requirements of the CAA and its state counterparts have a significant impact on the daily operation of Ashland’s businesses and, in many cases, on product formulation and other long-term business decisions. Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to air quality. Ashland’s businesses maintain numerous permits and emission control devices pursuant to these clean air laws.


The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has increased its frequency in reviewing the NAAQS. The USEPA has stringent standards for particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide. Throughout 2021, state and local agencies continued to implement options for meeting the newest standards. Particulate matter strategies include dust control measures for construction sites and reductions in emission rates allowed for industrial operations. Options for ozone include emission controls for certain types of sources, reduced limits on the volatile organic compound content of industrial materials and consumer products, and requirements on the transportation sector. Most options for sulfur dioxide focus on coal and diesel fuel combustion sources. It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential financial impact that these newest standards may have on Ashland’s operations or products. Ashland will continue to monitor and evaluate these standards to meet these and all air quality requirements.
 Solid Waste - Ashland’s businesses are subject to various laws relating to and establishing standards for the management of hazardous and solid waste. In the United States, Ashland’s facilities are subject to RCRA and its regulations governing generators of hazardous waste. Ashland has implemented systems to oversee compliance with the RCRA regulations. In addition to regulating current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the storage of regulated substances in underground tanks. Ashland has the remediation liability for certain facilities subject to these regulations. Other countries where Ashland operates also have laws and regulations relating to hazardous and solid waste, and Ashland has systems in place to oversee compliance.
 Water - Ashland’s businesses maintain numerous discharge permits. In the United States, such permits may be required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System of the Clean Water Act and similar state programs. Other countries have similar laws and regulations requiring permits and controls relating to water discharge.
 Climate Change and Related Regulatory Developments - Ashland has been collecting energy use data and calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for many years. Ashland evaluates the potential impacts from both climate change and the anticipated GHG regulations to facilities, products and other business interests, as well as the strategies commonly considered by the industrial sector to reduce the potential impact of these risks. These risks are generally grouped as impacts from legislative, regulatory and international developments, impacts from business and investment trends and impacts to company assets from the physical effects of climate change. Current North American, European and other regional regulatory developments are not expected to have a material effect on Ashland’s operations, although some facilities are subject to promulgated rules. Business and investment trends are expected to drive an increase in the demand for products that improve energy efficiency, reduce energy use and increase the use of renewable resources. At this time, Ashland cannot estimate the impact of this expected demand increase to its businesses. Physical effects from climate change have the potential to affect Ashland’s assets in areas prone to sea level rise or extreme weather events much as they do the general public and other businesses. Due to the uncertainty of these matters, Ashland cannot estimate the impact at this time of GHG-related developments on its operations or financial condition.
 Competition
 Ashland competes in the highly fragmented additives and specialty ingredients industries. The participants in these industries offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements. Participants compete with service and product offerings on a global, regional and/or local level subject to the nature of the businesses and products, as well as the end-markets and customers served. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers, customer service, industry knowledge and technical capability. Certain key competitors are significantly larger than Ashland and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility. The industry has become increasingly global as participants have focused on establishing and maintaining leadership positions outside of their home markets. Many of these segments’ product lines face domestic and international competition, due to industry consolidation, pricing pressures and competing technologies. To improve its competitive position, as Ashland narrows its focus, the company is building and more strongly leveraging the Ashland corporate brand as a differentiator to create value and better communicate the capabilities, promise and scale of the company, making it easier to introduce new product lines and applications.
Intellectual Property
 Ashland has a broad intellectual property portfolio which is an important component of its business. Ashland relies on patents, trade secrets, formulae and know-how to protect and differentiate its products and technologies. In addition, these reportable segments own valuable trademarks which identify and differentiate its products from its competitors. Ashland also uses licensed intellectual property rights from third-parties.
Raw Materials
 Ashland purchases its raw materials from multiple sources of supply in the United States and other countries and believes that raw material supplies will be available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in fiscal 2022. All of Ashland’s reportable segments were impacted, to varying degrees, by the volatility of raw materials costs in fiscal 2021, and these conditions may continue in fiscal 2022.
Research and Development
 Ashland’s program of research and development is focused on defining the needs of the marketplace and framing those needs into technology platforms. Ashland has the capability to develop and deliver the intellectual property required to grow and protect those platforms. Ashland is focused on developing new chemistries, market-changing technologies and customer driven solutions at numerous technology centers located in the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.
Seasonality
 Ashland’s business may vary due to seasonality. Ashland’s business units typically experience stronger demand during warmer weather months.
 Human Capital
 Employee Health and Safety - Cultivating a safety culture is intentional at Ashland and is best shown by our commitment to a Zero Incident Culture (ZIC). ZIC begins with the vision, values, beliefs, and actions of Ashland’s leaders demonstrating that zero incidents is possible. It means developing processes where compliance is the minimum expectation, allowing employees to proactively manage safety above compliance on the journey to ZERO.
 As an indication of its commitment to Responsible Care, Ashland obtained a third-party certification to RC14001, which includes the internationally recognized ISO 14001 certification and adds additional health, safety, security, and chemical industry requirements. Currently, Ashland has 29 international sites participating on a group RC14001 certification. Also, as part of its commitment to health and safety, 16 of the company's sites have obtained an additional ISO 45001 certification, an international health and safety management system.
 As part of ZIC, the company strives every day to achieve zero incidents. Ashland continues to make good progress on its journey. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company had a Total Preventable Recordable Rate (TPRR) of 0.73.
 Ashland has implemented several tools for communicating lessons learned from injuries, process safety incidents, and environmental releases. Immediately following an event, flash reports are developed and shared to communicate key lessons learned across the company. Additionally, incidents and root causes/corrective and preventive actions are reviewed monthly with company leadership to discuss areas for improvement and highlight the importance of identifying and addressing management system errors.
 Ashland has implemented the “Good Catch” Program aimed at identifying underlying unsafe conditions or behaviors that could lead to an undesirable outcome. Employees are encouraged to report good catches that fall into one of three categories – substandard conditions, near misses, and suggestions. These are tracked with the goal of continuing to increase overall reporting of identified good catches year to year.
Environmental - Ashland has a conscious and proactive mindset for sustainability and has established a renewable annual trust for ongoing and future environmental remediation and related litigation cash outlays. The initiative follows Ashland's announcement in February 2021 to align its operations with the ambitious aim of the Paris Climate Accord to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. At that time, Ashland also became a signatory to the United Nations Global

Compact and is making the United Nations principles part of the company's business strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations.
COVID-19 - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the world in unprecedented ways, affecting millions of people and countless institutions around the world. Ashland’s Incident Management Teams (IMT) have operated with the focus of keeping our employees, customers, and families safe while continuing to provide essential additives and specialty ingredients during this crisis.
 Since the beginning of its ZIC journey over 20 years ago, Ashland has focused on preparedness and prevention and established an IMT which executed pandemic response plans. The COVID-19 IMT was formed in early January 2020 to support its China and Asia-Pacific operations and scaled to five regional teams under the direction of the Global IMT and Executive Leadership Team.
 Ashland’s safety, health, purchasing, IT, supply chain, and human resource teams have worked with the company’s facilities to rapidly implement workplace changes, obtain personal protective equipment, and provide sanitization supplies to its employees while developing a reserve of materials to ensure continued safe operations. In addition, to foster a safe work environment, Ashland deployed its workforce expertise and raw materials to manufacture hand sanitizers when it became unavailable. The company distributed thousands of gallons of sanitizers for use in its facilities, and made significant donations to first responders in the communities in which the company operates to support the global response locally. 
Ashland’s first priority is always the health and well-being of its employees, customers, and communities. Since the start of the pandemic, the company’s focus has shifted from managing an immediate crisis to building in the flexibility needed to adjust for regional differences and changing conditions. In some regions, employees have been able to return to their work sites. Other regions, including most of EMEA, India and South America, remain on work-from-home protocols for non-essential personnel.
Human Capital Management - Ashland’s global workforce is foundational to its success. The company strives to be a great place to work by being a diverse and inclusive workplace, attracting and developing exceptional global talent, supporting employees’ physical, emotional, and financial wellbeing, and recognizing and rewarding performance.
