Item 1.    BUSINESS
General
Founded in 1938 in Portland, Oregon, as a small, family-owned, regional hat distributor and incorporated in Oregon in 1961, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown to become a global leader in designing, sourcing, marketing, and distributing outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products. 
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "we," "us," "our," "the Company," and "Columbia" refer to Columbia Sportswear Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintained a controlling financial interest.
Brands and Products
We connect active people with their passions through our four well-known brands by designing, developing, marketing, and distributing our outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment products to meet the diverse needs of our customers and consumers.
Columbia速. Founded in 1938, our Columbia brand unlocks the outdoors for everyone. Our Columbia brand is known for authentic, high-value outdoor apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment products designed with innovation, function, and quality suited for all seasons, activities and locations.
SOREL速. Acquired in 2000, our SOREL brand embodies function-first fashion footwear. Our SOREL brand provides premium, durable and design-driven footwear and accessories primarily to fashion-forward savvy women, as well as to men and youth consumers.
Mountain Hard Wear速. Acquired in 2003, our Mountain Hardwear brand exists to make gear that works, because out in the mountains, it matters for climbers. Our Mountain Hardwear brand offers premium apparel, accessories and equipment designed to meet the high-performance needs of climbing enthusiasts and to satisfy climbers' everyday lifestyles.

Our prAna brand provides consumers with clothes that tell a story. From city streets to mountain peaks, prAna outfits adventurous spirits in stylish, sustainable and versatile gear. 
Across our diverse portfolio of brands, our products have gained worldwide recognition for their innovation, quality and performance. Our products incorporate the cumulative design, fabrication, fit, and construction technologies that we have pioneered over several decades and continue to innovate. Our apparel, accessories and equipment products are designed to be used during a wide variety of activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, hiking, climbing, mountaineering, camping, hunting, fishing, trail running, water sports, yoga, golf, and adventure travel. Our footwear products include durable, lightweight hiking boots, trail running shoes, rugged cold weather boots for activities on snow and ice, sandals and shoes for use in water activities, and function-first fashion footwear and casual shoes for everyday use. 
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products in approximately 90 countries and operate in four geographic segments: United States ("U.S."), Latin America and Asia Pacific ("LAAP"), Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Canada. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, sourcing, marketing, and distribution of outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products.
We sell our products through a mix of distribution channels. Our wholesale distribution channel consists of small, independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores, regional, national and international sporting goods chains, large regional, national and international department store chains, internet retailers, and international distributors where we generally do not have our own direct operations. Our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") distribution channel consists of our own network of branded and outlet retail stores, brand-specific e-commerce sites, and concession-based arrangements with third-parties at branded, outlet and shop-in-shop retail locations in the LAAP and EMEA regions. In addition, we earn revenue through licensing some of our trademarks across a range of apparel, accessories, equipment, footwear, and home products.
U.S.
U.S. is our largest segment and provides apparel, accessories and equipment products through our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear, and prAna brands and footwear products through our Columbia and SOREL brands. We distribute the majority of our U.S. products from distribution centers that we own and operate in Portland, Oregon and Robards, Kentucky, as well as a third-
party logistics company that operates a warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky. In some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from contract manufacturers to wholesale customer-designated facilities in the United States. We have nearly 2,500 wholesale customers in the U.S. In 2020, our largest U.S. wholesale customer accounted for approximately 9% of U.S. net sales.
LAAP
LAAP provides apparel, accessories and equipment products through our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear and prAna brands and footwear products through our Columbia and SOREL brands. We distribute LAAP products through third-party logistics companies that operate warehouses near Tokyo, Seoul, and Shanghai. In addition, our LAAP wholesale business utilizes international distributors. The vast majority of our products sold to distributors are shipped directly to the distributors from the contract manufacturers from which we source our products. We have over 350 wholesale customers, including distributors, in LAAP. In 2020, our five largest LAAP wholesale customers accounted for approximately 11% of LAAP net sales.
EMEA
EMEA provides apparel, accessories and equipment products through our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear and prAna brands and footwear products through our Columbia and SOREL brands. We distribute the majority of EMEA products from a distribution center that we own and operate in France. In addition, our EMEA wholesale business utilizes international distributors. The vast majority of our products sold to distributors are shipped directly to the distributors from the contract manufacturers from which we source our products. We have over 3,550 wholesale customers, including distributors, in EMEA. In 2020, our largest EMEA wholesale customer accounted for approximately 16% of EMEA net sales.
Canada 
Canada provides apparel, accessories and equipment products through our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear and prAna brands and footwear products through our Columbia and SOREL brands. We distribute the majority of Canada products from a distribution center that we own and operate in Ontario. We have nearly 650 wholesale customers in Canada. In 2020, our largest Canada wholesale customer accounted for approximately 10% of Canada net sales.
See Item 7 and Item 8 in this annual report for further discussion regarding our reportable segments.
Seasonality and Variability of Business
Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry, including seasonal weather and discretionary consumer shopping and spending patterns. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis, and our sales are weighted substantially toward the third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year. 
Product Design and Innovation
We are committed to designing innovative and functional products for consumers who participate in a wide range of outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle activities, enabling them to enjoy those activities longer and in greater comfort by keeping them warm or cool, dry and protected. We distinguish our products in the marketplace by placing significant value in the design and fit, including the overall appearance and image, and technical performance features of our products.
Our internal team of specialists lead our research and development efforts by working closely with independent suppliers to conceive, develop and commercialize innovative technologies and products to provide the unique performance benefits desired by consumers. We utilize our working relationships with specialists in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, industrial design, materials research, graphic design, and other related fields, along with consumer insights and feedback, to develop and test innovative performance products, processes, packaging, and displays. These efforts, coupled with our drive for continuous improvement, represent key factors in the ongoing success of our products.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
We seek to substantially limit our invested capital and avoid the costs and risks associated with large production facilities and the associated large labor forces; therefore, we do not own, operate or manage manufacturing facilities. The majority of our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers located outside the United States. We establish and maintain long-term relationships with key manufacturing partners, but generally do not maintain formal long-term manufacturing volume commitments. The use of contract manufacturers greatly increases our production capacity, maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing.
We value legal, ethical and fair treatment of people involved in manufacturing our products. Independent contractors manufacturing our products are subject to our standards of manufacturing practices to facilitate decent, safe and humane working conditions, as well as promote ethical business practices. Each manufacturing facility is monitored regularly against these standards.
We maintain eight manufacturing liaison offices in seven Asia Pacific countries. Our personnel in these offices monitor production at our contract manufacturers' facilities to ensure our products are manufactured to our specifications. The physical location of our employees in these regional offices enhances our ability to monitor contract manufacturers for compliance with our policies, procedures and standards regarding quality, delivery, pricing, and labor practices. The design of our quality assurance process seeks to ensure that our products meet and maintain our quality standards and product reputation.
Our apparel, accessories and equipment products are manufactured in 12 countries, with approximately 50% of these products produced in Vietnam and China. Five of the largest contract manufacturers account for approximately 30% of our apparel, accessories and equipment production, with the largest manufacturer accounting for approximately 10%.
Our footwear products are manufactured in three countries, with the majority of these products produced in Vietnam and China. Five of the largest contract manufacturers account for approximately 85% of our footwear production, with the largest manufacturer accounting for approximately 45%. 
Raw materials for the manufacturing of our apparel, accessories, equipment, and footwear products are primarily sourced from Asia and are purchased directly by our contract manufacturers.
Marketing
Our portfolio of brands enables us to target a wide range of consumers across the globe with differentiated products. Our marketing supports and enhances our competitive position in the marketplace, drives global alignment through seasonal initiatives, builds brand equity, raises global brand relevance and awareness, infuses our brands with excitement, and, most important, stimulates worldwide consumer demand for our products.
Our integrated marketing efforts deliver consistent messages about the performance benefits, features and styles of our products within each of our brands and their different target consumers. We utilize a variety of means to deliver our marketing messages, including digital marketing, social media interactions, television and print publications, experiential events, brand ambassadors, branded retail stores in select high-profile locations, enhanced product store displays, and consumer focused public relations efforts. In addition, we reinforce our brands' marketing messages with our key wholesale customers by utilizing digital platforms, television, radio, print and advertising campaigns, as well as in-store branded visual merchandising display tools and favorable product presentation. 
We operate branded e-commerce and marketing sites and maintain an active presence on a variety of global social media platforms. We authorize and encourage our international distributors to connect with consumers by operating e-commerce and marketing sites and maintaining a presence on social media platforms. Digital marketing and social media engagement increase our brands' global ability to build strong emotional connections with consumers through consistent, brand-enhancing content. Our digital media connects our consumers to brand content and products, while facilitating their direct product purchases or directing them to nearby retail locations. 
Intellectual Property
Our trademarks create a market for our products, identify our company and differentiate our products from competitors' products. We own many trademarks, including Columbia Sportswear Company速, Columbia速, SOREL速, Mountain Hard Wear速, prAna速, the Columbia diamond shaped logo, the Mountain Hardwear nut logo, the SOREL polar bear logo, and the prAna sitting pose logo, as well as many other trademarks relating to our brands, products, styles, and technologies. 
Our design and utility patents describe the technologies, processes and designs incorporated into many of our most important products. We file applications for United States and foreign patents to protect inventions, designs and enhancements that we deem to have commercial value. We have design and utility patents, which expire at various times, as well as pending patent applications in the United States and other countries.
We vigorously protect these proprietary rights against counterfeit reproductions and other infringing activities.
Working Capital Utilization
Our working capital management goals include maintaining an optimal level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers and our retail stores to satisfy end consumer demand, alleviating manufacturing capacity constraints, and driving efficiencies to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers.
Demand Planning and Inventory Management 
Finished goods inventory continues to represent one of the largest and highest risk working capital assets in our business model. Our demand planning process and inventory management is designed to help us achieve our working capital management goals. We 
develop a forecast in an effort to drive timely purchases of inventory quantities to satisfy demand, minimize transportation costs, including rush costs needed to deliver products to customers by their requested delivery dates, and minimize excess inventory to avoid liquidating excess end-of season products at discounted prices.
Our production cycle from the design to the delivery of our products requires significant inventory commitment. We begin designing and developing our seasonal product lines approximately 12 months prior to soliciting advance orders from our wholesale customers and approximately 18 months prior to the products' availability to consumers in retail stores. The majority of our advance orders are shipped to wholesale customers for spring season products beginning in January and continuing through June, and for fall season products to wholesale customers beginning in July and continuing through December. Subsequent to advance order placements, wholesale customers may request replenishment orders for various products as consumer demand increases. We estimate the volumes of the season's products to be purchased from our global suppliers by utilizing our forecasted wholesale customers orders, cancellations, reorders, and replenishment orders, forecasted demand from our DTC businesses, market trends, historical data, customer and sales feedback, and other factors. We maintain and continue to make substantial investments in information systems, processes and personnel to support our ongoing demand planning efforts to provide forecasting of optimal inventory to meet customer and consumer demands. 
Credit and Collection
We extend credit to our wholesale customers and international distributors based on an assessment of the customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Wholesale customers may receive extended payment terms when placing advance orders and taking delivery of finished goods prior to peak seasonal shipping periods. We generally utilize credit insurance or standby letters of credit to minimize our risk of credit loss for customers in certain markets or with qualifying circumstances. We manage our inherent risk of uncollectable receivables by maintaining and investing in information systems, processes and personnel skilled in credit, risk analysis and collections.
Competition
The markets for outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment products are highly competitive and we face significant competition from numerous companies. Our competition includes large companies with significant financial, marketing and operational resources, small companies with limited resources but deep entrenchment in their local markets, and other branded competitors. We also face competition from our wholesale customers who, under their own private brand names, produce and distribute similar products to our target consumers through their own retail stores and e-commerce businesses. We identify our primary competitive factors in the markets for outdoor, active and everyday lifestyle products to be brand strength, product innovation, design, functionality, durability, and price, as well as effective marketing and delivery of product in alignment with consumer expectations.
Government Regulation
As a company with global operations, we are, and our products are, subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including laws and regulations concerning product safety, environmental standards, trade, information security, privacy, labor and employment, health, marketing, competition, and safety.
See Item 1A of this annual report for more information of risks relating to these laws, rules, and regulations.
Human Capital 
We believe that attracting and retaining exceptional talent strengthens our enterprise and propels us as a leader in product innovation. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work and promote employee well-being. 
2020 was a unique year for our workforce as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than operations teams related to retail, customer service and distribution, our workforce largely worked from home throughout most of 2020. For our employees who continued to work on-site, we instituted extensive safety protocols and procedures. We also aimed to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees financially by participating in each country's unique government stimulus programs, where applicable. 
Nevertheless, our employee workforce shrank globally in 2020 to nearly 7,275 employees at December 31, 2020 from nearly 8,900 at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, our employee workforce was comprised of approximately 3,700 full-time and part-time retail employees, 825 distribution employees and 2,750 corporate employees. From December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 we had an overall employee turnover rate of 56%, impacted by an 86% turnover rate in our retail employee base. Approximately 35% of our workforce was located outside of the United States at December 31, 2020.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation plans aim to reward performance. We offer competitive wages and, to align the interest of our management with those of our shareholders, shares of our common stock through a stock incentive plan. Globally, we offer employees affordable, competitive and comprehensive benefit programs. In the United States, for our largest employee base, we sponsor comprehensive medical, dental, vision and health savings or flexible spending account plans. We also provide 401(k) matching, paid time off, an employee assistance plan, life insurance, and short-term and long-term disability insurance.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At December 31, 2020, our global workforce was self-disclosed as 42% male, 56% female and 2% undisclosed or chose not to identify. In the United States, the self-disclosed ethnicity of our workforce, including retail and distribution employees, was 64% White, 7% Asian, 17% Hispanic or Latino, 5% Black, less than 1% American Indian or Alaskan Native, less than 1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 4% two or more races and 2% undisclosed or chose not to identify. A Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Leadership Team was formed in 2020 to lead our efforts toward a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. This team focuses on supporting strategies and efforts to advance progress in the following categories: listening and learning, diversifying talent, creating and sponsoring opportunities, and being a force for good.
Employee Well-Being
We align our employee programs to the five elements of well-being: physical health, career, social and emotional health, financial, and community. In the category of career, we focused our efforts in 2020 on digital learning through our Always Be Learning initiative and access to online learning opportunities.
