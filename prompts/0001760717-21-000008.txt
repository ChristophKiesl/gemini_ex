ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
SciPlay Corporation was formed as a Nevada corporation on November 30, 2018 as a subsidiary of Scientific Games Corporation (“Scientific Games”, “SGC”, and “the Parent”) for the purpose of completing a public offering and related transactions (collectively referred to herein as the “IPO”) in order to carry on the business of SciPlay Parent LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “SciPlay”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”). As the managing member of SciPlay Parent LLC, SciPlay operates and controls all of the business affairs of SciPlay Parent LLC and its subsidiaries. For further discussion related to the IPO, see Note 1. 
We are a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web platforms. We operate in the social gaming market, which is characterized by gameplay online, on mobile phones or on tablets that are social and competitive, and self-directed in pace and session length. We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of coins, chips and cards, which players can use to play slot games, table games or bingo games. Once obtained, coins, chips and cards (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play within our apps. We currently offer seven core games, including social casino games Jackpot Party Casino®, Gold Fish Casino®, Hot Shot Casino® and Quick Hit Slots®, and casual games MONOPOLY Slots®, Bingo Showdown® and 88 Fortunes Slots®, and recently added a solitaire social game targeted toward casual game players as a part of the Come2Play, Ltd (“Come2Play”) acquisition on various platforms referenced herein. Our social casino games typically include slots-style game play and occasionally include table games-style game play, while our casual games blend slots-style or bingo game play with adventure game features. All of our games are offered and played across multiple platforms, including Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft. In addition to our internally created game content, our content library includes recognizable, real-world slot and table games content from Scientific Games. This content allows players who like playing land-based slot machines to enjoy some of those same titles in our free-to-play games. We have access to Scientific Games' library of more than 1,500 iconic casino titles, including titles and content from third-party licensed brands such as MONOPOLY, JAMES BOND™, THE FLINTSTONES™, MICHAEL JACKSON™, and PLAYBOY™. We believe our access to this content, coupled with our years of experience developing in-house content, uniquely positions us to create compelling social games.
Mission
Our mission is to become the #1 casual mobile gaming company in the world.
Strategy
We strive to provide high quality services to our customers. To this end we are focused on the following strategies:
•Invest in growth from existing games - We continue to invest in and grow our current games by adapting and developing our monetization and marketing engines to improve player engagement, increase paying player conversion and drive per-player monetization. As we continue our data-driven approach to develop our games, we believe we will be able to further monetize our existing user base and attract new players.
•Develop new games -  We intend to continue to capitalize on our ability to build successful games by introducing new titles that appeal to specific player segments and offer differentiated experiences.
•Continue international growth and expansion -  We intend to further expand our global presence by incorporating our vast library of recognizable and regionalized brands and content in our game design, customization and marketing for regional audiences. As the global mobile gaming market expands, we believe there is an opportunity to continue to improve our reach across the rest of the world by offering more targeted content than we currently offer and a better game play experience than is currently available to international players.
•Expand into adjacent gaming markets -  We intend to continue to address additional segments within the broader mobile gaming market by expanding into adjacent areas and investing in new game markets. We believe our extensive experience in developing and operating social gaming titles strongly positions us to enter untapped areas within the casual market, such as puzzles, card, match three and board games.
•Leverage platform to scale through select acquisitions - We expect to continue to pursue select strategic acquisitions to fuel our top line growth and build our portfolio. We believe we can maximize the value of an acquired asset through our scalable platform and our rigorous, data-driven acquisition, engagement and monetization model.
Research and Development
We believe our ability to attract new players and retain existing players depends in part on our ability to evolve and expand our content library by continually developing differentiated games, systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and user profitability.
Our personnel are primarily located in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Austin, Texas, and Tel Aviv, Israel. We have additional personnel located in Chicago, Illinois; Des Moines, Iowa; Kiev, Ukraine; Bangalore, India and Pune, India, with services of the personnel located in Ukraine supplied to us through a third-party contractor and services of the personnel located in India supplied to us through our intercompany services agreement with Scientific Games.
Intellectual Property
We consider our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights and trade secrets, to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We seek to protect our investment in research and development by seeking intellectual property protection as appropriate for our technologies and content. We also acquire and license intellectual property from Scientific Games and third parties.
All of our games feature elements subject to copyright protection. In addition, we generally obtain trademark protection and often seek to register trademarks for the names and designs under which we market and license our games.

We believe the value associated with both our brands and the third-party licensed brands, including those of Scientific Games, under which we market and license our games contribute to the appeal and success of our games, and our future ability to license, acquire or develop new brand names of similar quality is important to our continued success. Therefore, we continue to invest in the recognition of our brands and brands we license. In addition to our own brands and those we license from Scientific Games, certain of our games are based on popular brands licensed from other third parties, such as MONOPOLY, JAMES BOND™, THE FLINTSTONES™, MICHAEL JACKSON™, and PLAYBOY™.
For a description of the IP License Agreement, see the risk factor captioned “We rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of Scientific Games and other third parties, including the third-party intellectual property rights licensed to Scientific Games that we have enjoyed as an indirect subsidiary of Scientific Games, and we may lose the benefit of any intellectual property owned by or licensed to Scientific Games if it ceases to hold certain minimum percentages of the voting power in our company” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 10.
Competition
We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Our primary social casino game competitors include Playtika, Product Madness/Big Fish Games (subsidiaries of Aristocrat), Zynga Inc., DoubleU Games/Double Down Interactive, GSN/Bash Gaming and Huuuge Games. Our competitors in the broader social game market include Glu Mobile, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Kabam, Rovio and Tencent Holdings. On the broadest scale, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players versus other forms of online entertainment, including social media, reading and other video games on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.
We believe we compete favorably on these factors. Our industry and the markets for our games, however, are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, shifting needs and frequent introductions of new games, development platforms and services. Successful execution of our strategy depends on our continuous ability to attract and retain players, expand the market for our games, maintain a technological edge and offer new capabilities to players. Our relationship with Scientific Games imposes certain regulatory and operational restrictions on us due to its business related to real money gaming. We compete with social gaming companies that do not have a similar connection to regulated real money gaming, and many of those companies possess a base of existing players larger than ours. In some cases, we compete against gaming operators who could expand their product lines to include social casino games and 
leverage their land-based gaming relationship with Scientific Games to license certain social casino game content that could compete with our content.
Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources, and, in some cases, the ability to rapidly combine online platforms with full-time and temporary employees. Internationally, local competitors may have greater brand recognition than us in their local country and a stronger understanding of local culture and commerce. They also offer their products and services in local languages we may not offer.
Seasonality
Our results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Player activity is generally slower in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months. However, due to the stay-at-home measures across the U.S. as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased player engagement starting in the second quarter of 2020. See the risk factor captioned “Our results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Human Capital
We are a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the social gaming market. Our global reach is made possible through the expertise, skills and dedicated efforts of our employees who serve our players across the globe.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 602 persons worldwide, which includes 332 domestic employees, 179 international employees, and 91 full-time third-party consultants largely based in Bangalore, India; Pune, India; and Kiev, Ukraine.
In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we frequently utilize employee surveys to understand the effectiveness of our employee and compensation programs and to determine where we can improve across the Company. Our latest survey, completed in fiscal 2020, indicated an overall favorable rating of 78% in 2020, an improvement of 5% from 2019. 
Safety: The health and safety of our employees is a top priority of our leaders. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented new work procedures that allow employees to work from home and collaborate remotely. We have also taken measures to keep our workforce safe by monitoring and reducing the impact of the outbreak, including putting protocols in place for responding when employees are infected and enhanced cleaning procedures at all sites.
Compensation and Benefits: We provide a competitive and comprehensive benefits program that is aligned with our business objectives and attempts to inspire employees to drive innovation and improve Company performance. In addition to cash compensation, we offer medical, dental and vision plans; an employee stock purchase plan; paid time off and paid holidays; company-paid disability; life insurance; a 401(k) plan; flexible spending accounts; employee assistance programs; and tuition reimbursement.
Government Regulation
We are subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies operating online, including over the internet and mobile networks, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could negatively impact our business, revenue and results.
We are subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of player data. Such regulations, such as the General Data Protections Regulation from the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect in California on January 1, 2020, and the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, are recent, untested laws and regulations that have and could further affect our operations and business. The extent of the potential impact is unknown.
There is significant opposition in some jurisdictions to social gaming, including social casino gaming. Anti-gaming 
groups that specifically target social casino games are located in several states and countries. Such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory framework to govern social gaming or social casino gaming specifically. These opposition efforts could lead to a prohibition on social gaming or social casino gaming altogether, restrict our ability to advertise our games or substantially increase our costs to comply with regulations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such legislation or regulation or the extent to which they may affect our business.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has previously held that a social casino game produced by one of our competitors should be considered illegal gambling under Washington state law. Similar lawsuits have been filed against other defendants, including Scientific Games. For example, in April 2018, a putative class action lawsuit, Fife v. Scientific Games Corp., was filed in federal district court alleging substantially the same causes of action against our social casino games. In December 2018, the federal district court assigned to the litigation denied Scientific Games' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint and, in January 2019, Scientific Games filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the putative class action complaint. See the risk factor captioned "Legal proceedings may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition" under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 11.
In September 2018, sixteen international gambling regulators, including from Washington State, signed a declaration expressing concern over the blurring of lines between gambling and video game products, including social casino gaming. The regulators analyzed the characteristics of video games and social gaming and the U.K. Parliament published a report on their findings in September 2019. The report addressed the regulators’ findings as to the potential psychosocial and financial harms of immersive technology, the potential usefulness of pattern-of-play data in understanding healthy gameplay and supporting responsible game design. The report found that any gambling-related harms of such games should be addressed through Internet safety legislation. As this report was published by U.K. authorities, we cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any actions taken as a result of the report.
As we offer our games worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim we are required to comply with local laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local presence, offices or other equipment. For additional information about other existing or potential regulation that could affect our business, see the risk factor captioned “Legal or regulatory restrictions could adversely impact our business and limit the growth of our operations” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
