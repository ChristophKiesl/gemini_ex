ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a company which provides independent, cost-effective, green electrical power through the leasing of electrical generation equipment under the trade name “PDI Power Solutions”. On March 11 2015, we entered into one agreement for the leasing of our equipment that has generated $1,240 in revenue to date. Our PDI Power Solution is a customized green power solution which allows a client to operate either independent of the grid (forming his own micro-grid) with the option for cogeneration (CHPC) or to operate while allowing the grid to act as a UPS System (uninterruptable power supply) if he chooses. Each PDI Power Solution is customized to meet our individual client’s unique power requirements. This is accomplished by using a modular design approach for the integration of all the components which make up each system. A typical PDI Power Solution is made up of a generator (gaseous), system controller (which allows for remote diagnostics, monitoring and control of a parallel generator system), a modified cooling system, an optional heat exchanger or chiller all packaged in either a weather proof/sound attenuated enclosure. Cogeneration capability CHPC (combination heat/power/cooling) is achieved by adding a closed loop cooling system to the generators with the addition of a heat exchanger and/or chiller. The heat exchanger produces hot water which can be used for heating and/or for preheating water. The chillers provide cooling to support air conditioning or refrigeration needs. PDI Power Solutions are intended to be either stationary or portable power systems ready for rapid global deployment taking only a few hours for installation. These systems can be packaged into modules which will provide as much as 100 megawatts of power.
 
We intend to acquire all the components needed to make a PDI Power Solution and either have them installed at the generator manufacturer’s facility to our specifications or integrated at the client’s site. We have developed strategic alliances with both our generator manufacturer and installation contractor to allow assembly of the system’s component parts either at the manufacturer’s or client’s facility.

Our potential customers include a variety of small to medium size manufacturing companies, hotels and commercial enterprises worldwide. In addition our power solutions are ideal for large end users such as seaports, commercial laundries, airports and the like. However, we initially intend to focus our marketing and sales efforts in the Caribbean and California markets, where we believe there is a great need for independent cost effective reliable power. The equipment lease that we recently entered into is for the leasing of a PDI Power Solutions in Puerto Rico. Once established in the Caribbean and California, we intend to expand our marketing throughout North America and as we move into other regions in North America we plan to increase the power ratings of the PDI Power Solutions to include multi-megawatt power generating systems.
 
On March 11, 2015, we entered into our first equipment lease with Farmacia Brisas del Mar, a Puerto Rican corporation (the “Lessee”); the agreement is for a term of five years. The custom designed system will also be able to provide cogeneration capabilities with the addition of chillers to support the customer’s air conditioning needs. The agreement provides for a payment to us of a monthly fee equal to the greater of a set monthly base rate or a monthly base rate plus an additional amount based on kilowatt wattage. The agreement provides for termination only in the event of nonperformance by us unless Lessee pays all payments due for the remainder of the term. The agreement contains representation and warranties, default provisions and indemnification provisions typical for agreements of this type. In 2016 the terms on the Farmacia Del Mar lease was modified to a monthly payment, based on actual power consumption.
 
We have a brief history in our current line of business and have experienced losses since our inception. As shown in the financial statements, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $3,374,003 from inception to December 31, 2016 and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued language in their audit report raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Products
 
Our product (PDI Power Solution) is a self-contained generator powered by a gaseous fueled engine which drives an electrical generator. The unit runs on natural gas, propane or other gaseous fuels; it is compact, lightweight and clean burning. As a result, the units produce low emissions and are energy-efficient.
 
The basis of our overall business is founded on the ability to produce electrical power using state-of-the-art technology to produce electricity at a lower cost than the existing means of producing or providing primary electric power (Spark Price: the difference between the cost of electricity provided by the utility company and the cost of electricity produced by a PDI Power Solution), in its target markets. We expect that the difference between our cost to produce electrical power and the current billing rate of existing local utility providers will present savings for our customers and a continual revenue stream for us.
 
The basic PDI Power Solution consists of three active components; a generator, system controller, and paralleling switch gear all mounted onto a common skid. The controller, switch gear and skid are all commercially available from multiple manufacturers built to our specifications. They are custom built to meet both our specifications as well as the customer’s specific power requirements. The PDI Power Solution can also have the option of having cogeneration capabilities of producing a combined heat power and cooling by adding custom integrated chillers and heat exchangers. These components once assembled onto the skid, can be put inside a weather and sound attenuated enclosure for stationary application or slid into a container and then mounted on a set of wheels for mobile and rapid deployment. The modular design approach allows for interchangeable components which allows for any component to be switched out as newer more cost effective technology becomes available. We believe this gives us the competitive advantage of upgrading a PDI Power Solution with new technology at the customer’s facility without replacing the entire system.

Business Model 
 
We plan to develop our business, producing and distributing primary electrical power and cogeneration CHCP capabilities through the PDI Power Solution product offerings, under long term master lease agreements, similar to the one we signed with Farmacia Brisas del Mar, at fixed capacity charge plus a usage charge based on actual power used at a fixed dollars per kilowatt hour ($/kWh). Installation, service and maintenance of the PDI Power Solution are initially being provided through independent contractors, at no cost to the customer.
 
We intend to provide a viable alternative for local utilities to reduce the demand on the primary grid by using our equipment and power, thereby increasing the limits and capabilities of the primary grid. By using our equipment, we expect that the customer will be able to solve several problems at once. First, expensive and polluting diesel units are replaced with cost-efficient, greener gensets. Second, the customer’s cost to produce the electrical power is reduced. Third, savings go directly to the bottom line on a monthly basis, no need to apply for energy credit annually. Fourth, maintenance is provided exclusively by us, thereby allowing the customer to reduce its workforce. Fifth, any tank farms and all other diesel support equipment or infrastructure can be dismantled and removed from the customer’s site.
 
Our History
 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2006 and was formerly known as Greenmark Acquisition Corporation (“Greenmark”). On February 7, 2011, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation and Powerdyne, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Powerdyne Nevada”), merged with Greenmark as the surviving company. Powerdyne Nevada was formed in February 2010 in the State of Nevada and had limited operations until the time of its combination described above. As part of the merger, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, the surviving entity, changed its name to Powerdyne International, Inc. Prior to the merger, Greenmark did not have any ongoing business or operations and was established for the purpose of completing mergers and acquisitions with a target company, such as Powerdyne Nevada.   
The Market
 
Our market is global and our primary focus is on placing PDI Power Solutions in manufacturing and commercial operations, as well as any other existing independent power generation application that requires high quality, steady electrical power generation. We intend to lease our units based on usage to allow customers to generate electricity on a 24/7 basis. The PDI Power Solution is ideal for any medium to large commercial user wherein electricity can be delivered to the user’s location on a cost effective, reliable basis.
 
Entry into the Market
 
We plan to enter selected target markets (i.e. the Caribbean and California) based upon the Sparks Spread. These markets were selected because we believe they have the greatest potential for immediate acceptability of the PDI Power Solution due to cost and reliability as well as offering the greatest profit potential. Once established, we plan to expand further into the Caribbean and North American markets using the same criteria: Spark Spread and profitability.
 
Pricing
 
Our intent is to provide electrical power at a lower price than the current utility companies. The PDI Power Solution pricing is based on the Spark Spread (the difference between the cost of electricity provided by the utility company and the cost of electricity produced by a PDI Power Solution.) Based on this model the PDI Power Solutions can typically offer a Spark Price of 15%. If we use the Caribbean as an example with an average electric rate of $0.30/kWh, and a Spark Price of $0.05/kWh, then a client using 150,000 kWh per month would expect to save $90,000 a year using a PDI Power Solution which, in turn, would yield $450,000 in revenue per year for the five year life of the contract.
