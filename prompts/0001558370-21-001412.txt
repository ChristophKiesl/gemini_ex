Item 1. Business
Overview
Rubius Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is genetically engineering red blood cells, or RBCs, to develop an entirely new class of cellular medicines called Red Cell Therapeutics, or RCTs. Our company was built upon the research and findings of Flagship Pioneering’s Venture Labs innovation team along with the discoveries of Professors Harvey Lodish and Hidde Ploegh of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT. Based on the premise that human red blood cells are the foundation of the next significant innovation in medicine, we have developed a proprietary and highly versatile platform, which we call the RED PLATFORM, to genetically engineer and culture RCTs that are selective, potent and ready-to-use cellular therapies for the potential treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.
In 2020, we demonstrated strong execution across our pipeline of RCTs. During the course of the year, we received clearance of our Investigational New Drug, or IND, applications for our lead oncology program, RTX-240, and our lead artificial antigen presenting cell, or aAPC, program, RTX-321. We are currently dosing adult patients in the RTX-240 Phase 1/2 clinical trial for relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors and in the RTX-240 Phase 1 clinical trial for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. 
In the RTX-240 Phase 1/2 clinical trial for solid tumors, we have completed dosing of 5 adult cohorts (n=14) to date. Trial enrollment continues in additional cohorts. In January 2021, we announced that initial clinical data from the solid tumor trial shows that RTX-240 stimulates innate and adaptive immunity, supporting proof of mechanism. Key observations from initial data include:

● | no treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities observed (n=14);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all patients showed activation of NK or T cells or both cell types (n=14); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | activation and expansion of both NK cells and T cells was observed in a majority of patients (n=8) across dose levels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As more patients are enrolled and data mature, we expect to report additional clinical results in early 2021, which we will also submit for presentation at a scientific conference. Such results are expected to include:

● | additional safety and tolerability data;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | the results from biomarker studies in patients;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | immune cell trafficking into tumors assessed by optional tumor biopsies from participating patients; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential responses as measured by objective response rate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we recently began screening patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 for the treatment of advanced human papillomavirus (HPV) 16-positive cancers. In January 2020, we operationalized our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island, which is currently providing current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, supply for each of these three ongoing clinical trials. We also continue to advance our preclinical-stage autoimmune program in Type I diabetes and explore ways in which to apply the RED PLATFORM across the remainder of our pipeline. 
We are developing RCT product candidates based on two therapeutic modalities —immune system stimulation for the treatment of cancer and immune modulation to induce tolerance in autoimmune diseases.

Cancer: RCTs are engineered to express combinations of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines on the cell surface to activate and expand different components of the immune system, which we believe have the potential to offer the following advantages:
Broad immune stimulation: Our RCT product candidates are engineered to broadly activate the adaptive and innate immune systems through immune cell agonists to attack and kill tumors. RCTs express combinations of co-stimulatory ligands and cytokines and are designed to replicate how the immune system naturally activates effectors, such as T and NK cells. Because red blood cells are restricted to the vasculature and spleen, these product candidates may have limited side effects as observed in our preclinical studies, with a potential for a broad therapeutic window. We believe RCTs have the potential to have wide therapeutic application across a range of solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Our lead oncology program, RTX-240, is engineered to express both 4-1BB ligand, or 4-1 BBL, and IL-15TP, a fusion of IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha, on the cell surface. It is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors and in a Phase 1 clinical trial for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. We are also currently conducting preclinical studies for RTX-224, a second broad immune stimulation program, which is engineered to express 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface.
Tumor antigen-specific immune activation via cell surface antigen presentation: We are also developing RCT product candidates to simultaneously express three signals on the cell surface: (1) a tumor-specific antigen in the context of major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, (2) a co-stimulatory ligand and (3) a cytokine. These cells (designated artificial antigen presenting cells) have a dual mechanism of action: they are designed to induce both a tumor antigen-specific immune response by expanding tumor antigen-specific T cells, as well as broad immune activation capable of expanding an anti-tumor response in vivo. RTX-321, our lead aAPC program, is engineered to express an HPV 16-associated peptide bound to MHC I, 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T

cell-APC interactions. We are currently screening adult patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating RTX-321 for the treatment of advanced HPV 16-positive cancers, including head and neck cancers, cervical cancer and anal cancer. We plan to follow RTX-321 with a range of programs that could target viral antigens, shared, or over-expressed cancer-associated antigens and personalized neoantigens.
Autoimmune Diseases: RCT product candidates are engineered to express specific autoimmune disease-associated antigens that cause and/or perpetuate autoimmune diseases in order to take advantage of the way in which the body normally maintains self-tolerance. These RCTs are designed to interact with the immune system in a way that will suppress or extinguish disease causing cells.
Broad and Diverse Pipeline
Rubius Therapeutics is advancing a broad pipeline of RCT product candidates. Our current programs are investigating applications across a range of cancer and autoimmune diseases. 

Definitions: aAPC—artificial antigen presenting cell; AML—acute myeloid leukemia; HPV16+—Human papillomavirus 16 positive; R/R —relapsed/refractory.
Manufacturing 
We believe we can generate hundreds of RCT product candidates using our RED PLATFORM and are utilizing our proprietary engineering and manufacturing processes to advance a broad pipeline of RCT product candidates into clinical development. We believe that common design and manufacturing elements of our RCTs should enable us to achieve significant advantages in product development. Recognizing the importance of controlling our own manufacturing capabilities to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, we have acquired, renovated and, as of January 2020, operationalized a manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island, that is currently providing cGMP compliant supply for our two Phase 1 arms in the ongoing clinical trial of RTX-240 for relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory AML and the Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 for advanced HPV 16-positive cancers. During 2020, the site achieved the following milestones: 

● | increased productivity in manufacturing of cGMP supply of RTX-240 in 50L bioreactors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | increased RTX-240 liquid in-vial shelf life from 28 to 52 days;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | for RTX-240, continuously met red blood cell identity (CD233+, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, purity, enucleation cell population) and target product profile criteria (protein expression, cell viability) for clinical supply lots; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | introduced frozen drug substance for the first time as part of the IND application for RTX-321, resulting in a truly off-the-shelf cellular therapy candidate with a potential shelf life of up to several years. Following liquid reformulation, RTX-321 drug product has an in-vial shelf life of 52 days.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities in the future and plan to stage additional investments based on future supply needs.
Seasoned Leadership Team
We have a talented group of seasoned leaders to execute our strategy. During the course of 2020, we strengthened our leadership team by hiring Christina Coughlin, M.D., Ph.D., as Chief Medical Officer, Laurence Turka, M.D., as Chief Scientific Officer, and Jose Carmona as Chief Financial Officer. Our leadership team has extensive experience in oncology, immunology, and cell therapy drug discovery and development.
Patent Portfolio
We have and continue to build a broad portfolio of patent applications, know how, trade secrets, and other intellectual property that covers both our platform technologies, as well as product discoveries, the breadth and depth of which is a strategic asset that could provide us with meaningful competitive advantages. As of January 31, 2021, we have 14 issued U.S. patents and 10 patents issued outside of the United States. Our lead product candidates – RTX-240, RTX-321 and RTX-224 – are covered by three varieties of issued U.S. patent claims: (1) composition of matter; (2) method of treatment; and (3) method of making. We have 29 patent families and more than 170 pending patent applications worldwide (not including provisional applications).
 ​
Utilizing Red Blood Cells to Create Cellular Therapies
RBCs represent the first example of a transformative cellular therapy as physicians have been administering blood to patients since the early 1800s. Today, the focus around cellular therapies has largely been directed toward T cell and other lymphocyte-based therapies. We believe that RBC-based therapies have the potential to transform the cellular therapy landscape as they may represent the ideal cell type for the creation of versatile, well-tolerated and off-the-shelf cellular therapies. We believe such therapies could eliminate many of the complications and risks often associated with earlier generation cellular therapies, including the emerging category of T cell-based therapies. 
​
Our Proprietary RED PLATFORM
Our discoveries and innovations in genetic engineering and cell culture processes support our belief that RBCs have the potential to serve as a foundation for the creation and development of a new class of cellular therapies. The RED PLATFORM and RCTs are designed to confer desirable attributes for a next generation cellular therapy, including the following:

● | Broad therapeutic applications: We believe we can engineer hundreds of RCTs to have therapeutic potential across many areas, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. RCTs can be engineered to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines on the cell surface, including combinations of proteins to activate and expand T cells, NK cells or antigen-specific T cells for the potential treatment of cancer; or to express autoimmune disease-associated antigens within or on the cell surface, along with proteins that suppress immune responses, to induce immune tolerance for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases. While the focus of our RED PLATFORM is currently in cancer and autoimmune diseases, we believe the versatility of our platform can be applied to other therapeutic areas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advantageous tolerability: RCTs lack nuclei and do not divide following administration to patients. As a result, we believe our RCT product candidates will potentially pose less risk than those associated with other cellular therapies, which have caused cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and death. In addition, based on the low level of nucleated cells in our product candidates, the potential risk of inducing oncogenicity is low compared with other nucleated cellular therapies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Allogeneic: RCTs are produced from O negative donor blood stem cells, which can be administered to 95% of the population, and are therefore allogeneic, ready-to-use cellular therapies that we believe will be tolerated by many patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Predictable biodistribution: RBCs normally reside in the vasculature and the spleen and do not extravasate in appreciable numbers into other healthy tissues. Biodistribution into the spleen allows for RCTs designed to stimulate the immune system to interact with the large number of immune cells that reside there and promote an attack against cancer. Recent evidence published in scientific journals suggests that anti-tumor T cells with the potential to be activated to attack tumors may primarily reside in the peripheral blood and spleen -the two locations of action of RCTs as shown in our preclinical studies. Following RCT engagement with these anti-tumor T and NK cells, the activated effector cells are expected to traffic to the tumor microenvironment. We anticipate that this predictable biodistribution will allow RCTs to generate desired clinical activity as a result of the antitumor T and NK cell-interactions in the peripheral blood and spleen, while avoiding off-tissue engagement in other organs that can lead to toxicities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient product engine: Our RED PLATFORM provides a consistent product design and discovery approach. By modifying the gene or genes that encode biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface of RCTs, we are able to rapidly develop new RCTs designed to treat different diseases. Our uniform approach should also enable us to leverage common chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) and toxicology data packages to shorten development timelines.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalable and flexible manufacturing: We manufacture RCTs in bioreactors that we intend to scale over time to support multiple ongoing clinical trials and, ultimately, commercial production should we obtain regulatory approval. A single donor is expected to support the manufacturing of up to thousands of doses, depending on the therapeutic application. As a result, we expect the cost of goods sold for RCTs to eventually be significantly lower than existing cellular therapies, such as CAR-T therapy. We manufacture RCTs using well-characterized lentiviral vectors. In the case of RTX-321, with the introduction of frozen drug substance, the product candidate has a potential shelf life of several years, making it a truly off-the-shelf cellular therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
Our vision is to create life-changing, allogeneic cellular therapies for patients with severe diseases. To achieve our vision, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements:
Establish RCTs as a new class of cellular medicines, demonstrating their potential across two initial product categories: cancer and autoimmune diseases. We apply a rigorous and capital-efficient approach to prioritize our product candidate pipeline, focusing on unmet need, feasibility, speed to proof-of-concept, cost to manufacture, validated endpoints and commercial potential. 
Pursue accelerated paths to marketing authorization. We are focusing on indications with high unmet needs that may allow us to pursue accelerated paths to product registration. 
Build a leading, fully integrated cellular therapy company. We are discovering, developing and manufacturing RCT product candidates for the potential treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. 
Further strengthen our position as the pioneer of RCTs through continuous platform expansion and improvement. Our proprietary RED PLATFORM allows us to rapidly identify new product candidates and includes a universal manufacturing process for all RCT product candidates. We will continue to invest in enhancing our platform and deepening our expertise in stem cell and red blood cell biology and optimizing the pharmacology of RCTs with the goal of delivering new therapies targeting additional indications. We plan to leverage our first-mover advantage in manufacturing RCTs as we scale-up our proprietary manufacturing platform and fully-owned, operational cGMP manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island. 

11



Expand patient access to RCTs through strategic partnerships. Given the breadth of therapeutic opportunities for RCTs, we believe entering into select strategic partnerships in a subset of therapeutic areas may provide an attractive avenue for expanding patient access to RCTs. The global reach and operational expertise within certain pharmaceutical companies may complement our growing organization in areas such as clinical development and commercialization.
Maintain a strong culture, continuously attract new talent and build the world’s leading center for red blood cell biology research and engineering. Our headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the world’s leading hubs for biopharmaceutical innovation, providing us access to world-class talent, leading academic investigators and key opinion leaders. We have leveraged our location to attract scientific talent and experienced, innovative leaders and have built a strong culture that is focused on realizing our vision. In recognition of this commitment, we were named a 2020 Top Places to Work by the Boston Globe. In addition, we have a highly experienced cell therapy technical operations team at our fully owned manufacturing site in Smithfield, Rhode Island, which was named among the 2020 Top 5 Places to Work in Rhode Island by the Providence Business Journal. We have assembled a network of scientific advisors with deep expertise in red blood cell biology, process development and manufacturing, as well as clinical experience across the therapeutic areas that we are initially targeting. We will continue to build a team of employees, advisors and collaborators with experience in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of cellular therapies.
​
Our product candidate pipeline
Cancer
We believe that RCTs may have broad therapeutic applicability across a range of both solid and hematological cancers and are developing a pipeline of RCTs that target T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells or combinations thereof that are designed to then lead to the killing of tumor cells. Our RCT oncology pipeline is unique in the field of immuno-oncology as our RCTs are engineered to target cancer in both a non-specific manner (combining T cell agonists and cytokines on the cell surface) for broad immune system stimulation and in an antigen-specific manner with our artificial antigen-presenting cells to generate a tumor antigen-specific response. In addition to investigating the single-agent activity of each RCT product candidate in the clinic, we plan to evaluate our RCTs in combination with other immuno-oncology agents, as well as standard of care therapy (for example, chemotherapy or signaling inhibitors). 
Broad Immune System Stimulation: RTX-240 and RTX-224 
RTX-240 and RTX-224 are designed to broadly stimulate and expand adaptive and innate immunity to generate an antitumor response, replicating how the immune system naturally functions. RTX-240 and RTX-224 represent two approaches to combination agonist therapy in the clinic.
RTX-240 is designed as a broad immune agonist engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of trimeric 4-1BBL and IL-15TP, a fusion of IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha, on the red blood cell surface in their native forms. This combination is synergistic and designed to activate and expand both NK cells and CD8+ memory T cells. The potent activation of the NK cell subset by RTX-240 leads to a mechanism of action that may allow the identification of specific tumor types thought to be susceptible to this mechanism, for example, those immunologically “cold” tumors, with low PD-L1 and low MHC class I expression. We expect to utilize the specific biology of both target cells, the NK and T cells, to select appropriate indications for the further development of RTX-240 in both hematologic and solid tumors. 
In contrast to RTX-240, RTX-224 has been designed as a broad agonist to primarily activate and expand T cells. It is engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface. IL-12 stimulation of immune cells drives the activation and proliferation of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells across the subsets, driving Th1 differentiation, and promotes antigen presentation through the effects of IL-12 on the innate immune response. The combination of IL-12 and 4-1-BBL signaling seeks to potently stimulate the proliferation and activation of all subsets of effector T cells, as well as cells of the innate response, while limiting the activation of the regulatory T cell population. Together, we expect these mechanisms to produce a broad and potent antitumor T cell response and innate response and to have activity in those tumor types with known sensitivity to T cell killing, including tumor types with high mutational burden, PD-L1 expression and prior activity of the checkpoint inhibitors. 

12



Each of IL-15 and IL-12 has potentially potent effects that will guide the development plans for RTX-240 and RTX-224. We believe the synergistic activity between the expression of 4-1BBL and these two key cytokines has the potential to provide a number of therapeutic benefits:

● | Improved antitumor activity through broad and sustained activation of specific elements of the immune system: Both RTX-240 and RTX-224 drive robust stimulation of T cells as 4-1BBL and the cytokines (IL-15TP or IL-12) are simultaneously presented in high copy numbers to these immune cells, thereby simulating a potent anti-tumor response. The two cytokines target different cell types and different aspects of the immune system, and these differential activities will guide the development of each agent in the clinic. We believe this synergy between the two signals in both programs has the potential to result in improved outcomes, either as monotherapy or in combination with existing immunomodulatory therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Further, we believe that by demonstrating that RTX-240 and RTX-224 are working as intended to induce antitumor innate and adaptive immune responses, we can unlock the potential of the RED PLATFORM across our pipeline of cancer programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prevention or mitigation of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors: Checkpoint inhibitors block suppression of the adaptive immune system in cancer patients, allowing activation of T cells to kill cancer cells. There are several recognized mechanisms of tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors including the loss of MHC I expression and low mutational burden and thus low tumor antigen expression that could be addressed by the mechanisms of action of the RCT product candidates. We therefore believe that both RTX-240 and RTX-224, used either alone or in combination with other immunotherapies, could prevent the emergence of, or mitigate, resistance to T cell mediated killing, and these mechanisms could assist in selecting those tumor types most sensitive to each mechanism of action.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical potential in tumors that are resistant or refractory to immunotherapy: We believe both RTX-240 and RTX-224 have the potential to provide therapeutic benefits to patients whose disease has progressed on standard immunotherapy approaches, including checkpoint inhibitors. In such patients, we believe that the combination of 4-1BBL and potent cytokine signaling has the potential to promote tumor killing. In addition to the immune effector cell activation effects with these RCTs, the induction of antigen presentation with IL-12 is likely important when addressing tumors that do not respond to existing immunotherapies due to loss of tumor antigens or low mutational burden, where augmenting the specificities of the anti-tumor T cell response is thought to be a key driver of anti-tumor immunity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tolerability: We expect both RTX-240 and RTX-224 to be confined to the vasculature and the spleen and thus not reach specific organs where agonists have demonstrated toxicity (for example, the liver). We believe this makes these product candidates less likely to have side effects and more likely to have a broad therapeutic window. In contrast, direct systemic administration of cytokines, including IL-15, IL-12 and other interleukins, as well as 4-1BB pathway agonism by monoclonal antibodies, has been limited by safety and tolerability concerns in the clinical development of these approaches, resulting in a narrower therapeutic window. We believe that RTX-240 and RTX-224 may provide greater tolerability with the potential for anti-tumor activity without the toxicities observed with other immune agonists.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that both RTX-240 and RTX-224 provide potentially transformative approaches to treating patients with solid or hematological tumors whose disease responds to immunotherapies, including CAR-T, as well as tumors that are or have become resistant or refractory to immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors. We expect to initially study RTX-240 across a range of solid tumor types and in patients with myeloid diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, or in patients ineligible for stem cell transplant. We believe we can expand this indication into patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma, as these diseases have similar biology and may respond to the NK mechanism of RTX-240. We expect that, given the dual NK and T cell mechanism observed in preclinical studies, the application of RTX-240 will target those tumor types susceptible to the dual mechanism and would be anticipated to have monotherapy activity in such tumor types.

RTX-240 in solid tumors
Current therapies and their limitations
Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-programmed death protein 1 antibodies, or anti-PD-1 antibodies, act by inhibiting suppression of the adaptive immune system in cancer patients and have significantly extended survival in multiple solid tumor types, particularly in patients with advanced cancers. The vast potential of checkpoint inhibitors is highlighted by market projections that estimate sales for this class of drugs could reach $50 billion in 2024. Despite the encouraging efficacy of checkpoint inhibition for some patients, overall response rates remain relatively low and range, on average, from 25% to 50%. Unfortunately, even when a patient’s cancer does respond to treatment, the disease often progresses within six to 12 months, depending on the cancer and the therapeutic intervention. Clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly evaluating combination therapies to improve response rates and to expand the size of the treatable population. RTX-240 has the potential to overcome resistance to the checkpoint inhibitors, given the biology of the immune stimulation observed with RTX-240. 
Preclinical data for RTX-240 in solid tumors
In November 2020, we presented preclinical data for RTX-240 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s Annual Meeting, demonstrating the following:

● | RTX-240 promotes the expansion of human NK and CD8+ T cells in vitro and is more effective than the combination of recombinant IL-15 and an anti-4-1BB agonist antibody (4-1BB Ab).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PBMCs were cultured with control RCT (RCT-CTRL), an RCT engineered to express 4-1BBL or IL-15TP, RTX-240, anti-4-1BB Ab, recombinant IL-15 or anti-4-1BB Ab plus IL-15. Cells were cultured for 8 days without anti-CD3 to measure NK cell numbers or with anti-CD3 to measure CD8+ T cell numbers.

14




● | mRBC-240, a murine surrogate for RTX-240, consisting of murine red blood cells, or mRBCs, chemically conjugated with 4-1BBL and IL-15TP, promoted significant expansion of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in vivo in a murine model of colorectal cancer (CT26).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blood samples were obtained from CT26 tumor-bearing mice four days after dosing with control mRBCs (mRBC-CTRL), mRBCs chemically conjugated with either 4-1BBL or IL-15TP (mRBC-4-1BBL and mRBC-15-15TP respectively), mRBC-240, agonist antibody to 4-1BB, or recombinant IL-15. mRBC-240 significantly promoted NK and CD8+ T cell expansion, and proliferation and expression of granzyme B by NK cells. Effects comparable to recombinant IL-15 or anti-4-1BB were seen.

● | mRBC-240 demonstrated potent antitumor activity in a B16F10 melanoma model that was directly correlated with the expansion of terminally differentiated NK cells in the tumors
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mice inoculated with B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with mRBCs chemically conjugated with either 4-1BBL or IL-15TP (mRBC-4-1BBL and mRBC-IL-15TP respectively), mRBC-240, agonist antibody to 4-1BB, or recombinant IL-15 on days 1, 4, and 8 after tumor inoculation. On day 14 we measured lung metastases, spleen weight, and the percentage of terminally differentiated NK cells (CD11b+CD27-KLRG1+) in the lung. mRBC-240 effectively reduced lung metastases without causing the adverse side effect of increasing spleen weight. Increases in differentiated NK cells were seen and this correlated with efficacy.

15



These data suggest that expressing 4-1BBL and IL-15TP on RTX-240 may provide potent stimulation of these important anti-tumor pathways, while the biodistribution of RTX-240 may widen the therapeutic window for these agonist pathways.
Clinical Development of RTX-240 in solid tumors
We are currently enrolling adult patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating RTX-240 in patients with relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. The trial is an open-label, multicenter, multidose, first-in-human dose escalation and expansion study to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and optimal dosing interval, pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-240. Primary outcome measures include: (1) safety as measured by incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs; (2) dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, as determined by incidence and severity of adverse events; (3) pharmacodynamic, or PD, effects which are evaluated through changes in NK and T cell activation state and numbers relative to baseline in both peripheral blood, as well as in on-treatment tumor biopsies; and (4) antitumor activity as measured by objective response rate. Secondary outcome measures include: (1) the pharmacokinetics, or PK, of RTX-240 as measured by the number of RTX-240 cells positive for both 4-1BBL and IL-15 using flow cytometry; (2) determination of immunogenicity of RTX-240 as measured by incidence of antibodies to RTX-240; and (3) antitumor activity of RTX-240 as measured by clinical benefit rate, or CBR, duration of response, or DoR, progression-free survival, or PFS, overall survival, or OS, time to response, or TTR, and time to progression, or TTP. The study will include an expansion phase in specified tumor types during the Phase 2 portion of the solid tumor arm.
​
As of January 2021, we have completed dosing of 5 adult cohorts (n=14) to date. Trial enrollment continues in additional cohorts. We announced that initial clinical data from the solid tumor trial shows that RTX-240 stimulates innate and adaptive immunity, supporting proof of mechanism. Key observations from initial data include:

● | no treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities observed (n=14);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all patients showed activation of NK or T cells or both cell types (n=14); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | activation and expansion of both NK cells and T cells was observed in a majority of patients (n=8) across dose levels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We plan to report additional clinical data in early 2021 and submit the data for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference. The figure below, as of January 11, 2021, summarizes our planned development of RTX-240.

*Exploratory alternative route of administration. 
​
We are planning to evaluate RTX-240 as monotherapy in solid tumors. We expect to utilize the biology of RTX-240 immune stimulation to select appropriate indications for future development. In addition to the solid tumor development, RTX-240 is being pursued as a potential single agent agonist in the setting of myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, where a second Phase 1 trial is ongoing as described further under the heading “RTX-240 - relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia” below.

16



RTX-240 – relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia 
Current therapies and their limitations
Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid blasts. They replace the bone marrow so that there is minimal production of platelets, red blood cells and neutrophils. It is primarily a disease of the elderly with a median age of diagnosis of 68 years. In 2017, there were more than 20,000 new cases of AML and more than 10,000 deaths caused by AML in the United States.
Standard first-line AML treatment has been unchanged for over 40 years: a regimen of intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Some patients experience remission and then a return of the leukemia, which is referred to as relapsed AML. Refractory AML occurs when patients have received treatment, typically two rounds of chemotherapy, but the disease does not go into remission. The overall outcome for patients with relapsed/refractory AML remains poor, with 5-year overall survival of approximately 10 percent. Limited therapeutic options currently exist for these patients. 
Therefore, many younger patients with AML undergo HSCT, which can be curative if the transplant is successful. In 2016, more than 3,500 AML patients underwent allogeneic HSCT in the United States and over 6,200 underwent the procedure in Europe.
Recently, additional therapies have been approved for treatment of AML, such as venetoclax, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CPX-351, and, for patients with specific mutations, midostaurin and enasidenib. Although these therapies improve response rates and enable more patients to bridge to transplant, overall survival rates remain low.

Preclinical Data for RTX-240 in AML
In November 2020, we presented preclinical data for RTX-240, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s Annual Meeting, demonstrating that RTX-240 promotes NK cell killing of a myeloid leukemia cell line. We believe these promising preclinical results may translate into clinical benefit for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, where the activation status of the NK cells is linked to clinical outcomes. We observed the following:

● | RTX-240 promoted NK cell-killing of a myeloid leukemia cell line, K562, which was accompanied by increased NK cell degranulation and activation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purified NK cells were incubated with RTX-240 overnight and then cultured with K562 cells (a myeloid leukemia cell line). RTX-240 enhanced NK cell activation (CD107a and CD69 expression) resulting in increased killing of the leukemic cells.

17




● | Additionally, RTX-240 expanded CD56dim NK cells, a cell population with high cytotoxicity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purified NK cells were incubated with RTX-240, control cells (RCT-CTRL) or recombinant IL-15 for 8 days. While both recombinant IL-15 and RTX-240 were able to increase the total NK cell numbers, RTX-240 was more effective in expanding CD56dim NK cells, the population of NK cells associated with enhanced cytotoxic potential.

● | Treatment with mRBC-240 did not lead to an increase in spleen weight as opposed to 4-1BB agonistic antibodies and rIL-15.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical development for RTX-240 in AML
Disease-induced mechanisms in myeloid malignancies like AML have been noted to negatively affect key properties of NK cells such as their differentiation and cytotoxic potential. The resulting NK cell dysfunction is thought to contribute to disease progression in AML. Further, NK cell function during and after treatment for AML is linked to treatment response and outcome, suggesting that NK cells play a key role in this setting. 
In addition to the general effects of NK cells in the AML setting, the effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT depends on both the killing of residual tumor by high-dose chemotherapy and on graft versus leukemia effects. NK cells are a critical component of the graft versus leukemia effect. After bone marrow ablation and allogeneic transplantation, NK cells are the first lymphocyte population to recover, but their killing and cytokine-secreting functions are limited when compared to the NK cells of healthy donors. The rate of return and function of NK cells are correlated with treatment outcome post-allogeneic HSCT, so increasing the number and function of NK cells post-allogeneic HSCT to stimulate the graft versus leukemia effect has the potential to increase survival in patients receiving allogeneic HSCT for treatment 

18



of AML. As discussed above, 4-1BBL and IL-15TP induce proliferation and maturation of NK cells, supporting the testing of RTX-240 in both the relapsed or refractory transplant-ineligible populations, as well as the post-allogeneic HSCT setting. We believe that RTX-240 has the potential to have effects in AML under both clinical scenarios.
We are dosing patients with relapsed or refractory AML in a Phase 1 arm of RTX-240 which includes patients post-transplant or those who are not eligible for an allogeneic transplant. 
The Phase 1 clinical trial is an open-label, multicenter, multidose, first-in-human dose escalation and expansion to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and optimal dosing interval, pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-240. Primary outcome measures include: (1) safety as measured by incidence of TEAEs; (2) DLTs as determined by incidence and severity of adverse events; (3) PD effects which are evaluated through changes in NK and T cell numbers relative to baseline; and (4) antitumor activity as measured by overall response rate. Secondary outcome measures include (1) the PK of RTX-240 as measured by the number of RTX-240 cells positive for both 4-1BBL and IL-15 using flow cytometry; (2) determination of immunogenicity of RTX-240 as measured by incidence of antibodies to RTX-240; and (3) antitumor activity of RTX-240 as measured by CBR, DoR, PFS, OS, TTR and TTP. 
The figure below, as of January 11, 2021, summarizes our planned development of RTX-240 in relapsed/refractory AML.

RTX-224
As observed in preclinical studies, RTX-224 expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of the costimulatory molecule 4-1BBL and IL-12 to induce innate and adaptive immunity to generate an antitumor response. We believe that RTX-224 has the potential to induce a potent T cell response across both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and we will therefore target tumors with known sensitivity to this mechanism, including tumor types with high mutational burden, PD-L1 expression and prior activity of the checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, given the effects of IL-12 in the innate response, we believe that RTX-224 has the potential to induce tumor antigen presentation, thus contributing to a broad and effective antitumor immune response.
Preclinical data for RTX-224
RTX-224 has been shown to drive both T cell and NK cell activation and expansion by simultaneously and proximately co-expressing IL-12 and 4-1BBL. 
Our in vivo studies of a murine surrogate of RTX-224, mRBC-224, administered subcutaneously in an MC38 colon cancer mouse model provided evidence in support of RTX-224’s immune activation and tumor control. In this model, tumor cells were injected to establish growing tumors and then mice were treated with a control mRBC (mRBC-CTRL) alone, mRBC-224 alone, an anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with mRBC-CTRL, or with mRBC-224 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. mRBC-224 administered as a monotherapy reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with mRBC-CTRL with or without and anti-PD-1 antibody. mRBC-224 administered alone resulted in 5/11 tumor regressions, while mRBC-224 administered in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody induced 9/11 tumor regressions. These results are depicted below.

Activity of mRBC-224 in an MC38 Colon Cancer Mouse Model 
Dugast, et. al., American Association for Cancer Research; Poster #3256, 2019.
In contrast to systemic recombinant IL-12, mRBC-224 resulted in significantly reduced toxicity likely due to the restriction of red blood cells to the vasculature and spleen. Mice treated with mRBC-224 maintained body weight over time, whereas mice administered systemic recombinant IL-12, with or without a 4-1BB agonist antibody, had significant loss of body weight versus controls. mRBC-224 treated mice had no evidence of liver toxicity, as assessed by a lack of increase in serum alanine transaminase and liver weight, compared to mice treated with systemic recombinant IL-12. The charts below summarize these results.

Clinical development for RTX-224
While checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. Responses are confined to certain tumor types and only a limited portion of patients are cured. Currently, the challenge in immunotherapy is to induce responses in refractory tumors, as well as to increase the rate and duration of response. 

20



IL-12 is known to drive the activation and proliferation of all subsets of T cells and promote antigen presentation on dendritic cells through the effects of IL-12 on the innate responses. This antigen presentation may enable us to target formerly non-immunogenic tumors by enhancing their immune signature and activating a broader T cell response against the tumor, potentially leading to a more effective immunotherapy approach. Additionally, by stimulating a broad T cell response across both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, RTX-224 could be combined with checkpoint inhibitors with the potential to both improve and extend responses.
In the future, we are planning to evaluate RTX-224 in solid tumors as monotherapy. We also plan to study RTX-224 in patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy and in indications with limited evidence of activity of checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Tumor antigen-specific immune stimulation
Current therapies and their limitations
Immuno-oncologists are pursuing multiple approaches to target antigens for the purpose of killing cancer cells. CAR-T cell therapies are an autologous approach that engineers a patient’s own T cells ex vivo to target a specific antigen. However, CAR-T therapies have shown efficacy in a limited number of hematological malignancies, can have significant toxicity and have challenges with manufacturing and scaleup. CAR-NK cells are an alternative approach utilizing the innate killing properties of allogeneic NK cells expressing antigen receptors by companies such as Nkarta Therapeutics. Other companies are using different therapeutic modalities to try to expand the number of T cells targeting a particular antigen in vivo, such as BioNTech SE using RNA and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. using DNA-based therapy. Despite these multiple approaches, there remains a need for more effective therapies that target cancer, or cancer-associated antigens to unlock the potential of cancer vaccines. 
We believe our approach to engineering red blood cells as artificial antigen presenting cells has the potential to represent a significant improvement over previous approaches by increasing the quality and quantity of T cell response through direct antigen presentation, as well as enabling antigen spread to other tumor antigens through broad anti-tumor immune stimulation. 
RTX-321 for HPV 16-positive tumors
RTX-321 is an allogeneic aAPC therapy product candidate that is engineered to induce a tumor antigen-specific immune response by expanding tumor antigen-specific T cells. RTX-321 expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of an HPV peptide antigen bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins, the costimulatory molecule 4-1BBL and the cytokine IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions.
Preclinical data for RTX-321 
In 2020, we presented preclinical data at The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Annual Meeting, the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies (FOCIS) Virtual Annual Meeting and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Tumor Immunology Conference, demonstrating for the first time that RTX-321 has a dual mechanism of action by not only functioning as an antigen-presenting cell to boost HPV 16 antigen-specific T cell responses, but also promoting broad immune system stimulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The ability to engage both arms of the immune system is expected to provide a robust anti-tumor response by T cells and innate immune cells, making it harder for the tumor to escape by immune evasion. In studies using mRBC-OVA-4-1BBL-IL-12, a murine surrogate for RTX-321, we observed proliferation (indicated by Ki67 expression) of both CD8+ T cells and NK cells in tumors, as well as infiltration of the tumor by antigen-specific T cells producing both IFNg and granzyme B.
​
This dual mechanism of action is a key part of the development of epitope spreading, suggesting that RTX-321 may induce the expansion of an immune response to secondary epitopes, or antigens, that are not expressed on RTX-321, as well as the development of a potent memory response, potentially enabling the body to remember a cancer’s identity, which is critical to providing long-term protection from recurrence of the tumor. As shown below, in the experiment on the left, animals that were cured of their tumor by mRBC-OVA-4-1BBL-IL-12 were immune to rechallenge with the 

21



tumor. On the right, animals that were cured of their tumor by mRBC-OVA-4-1BBL-IL-12 were rechallenged with the tumor lacking the original antigen. Here, 6/7 mice had delayed tumor growth and three were cured, indicating the development of epitope spreading.

Clinical Development for RTX-321
We are screening patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial of RTX-321 for the treatment of patients with HPV 16-positive cancers. HPV 16 is associated with approximately 70% of cervical cancers, approximately 40% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, arising in the oropharynx, approximately 25% to 40% of HNSCC arising in other locations and approximately 80% to 85% of anal cancers. A critical need exists for better treatment options for advanced HPV 16-positive cancers. The prognosis remains poor for patients with metastatic disease with few treatment options beyond the first-line setting.
The RTX-321 Phase 1 clinical trial is an open-label, multicenter, multiple-ascending dose, first-in-human study of RTX-321 for the treatment of adult patients with HPV 16-positive cancers. Patients eligible for this study include those that are HLA-A*02:01 positive with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic, unresectable, HPV 16-positive cancers, including unresectable cervical cancer (squamous, adeno, or adenosquamous histology), HNSCC or squamous cell cancer of the anal canal that is not amenable to curative therapy. The purpose of the trial is to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-321. Prior to study screening, all patients must be confirmed to be HLA-A*02:01 positive. Documentation of an HPV 16-positive tumor is required at prescreening for patients with cervical cancer and HNSCC. The study will include a monotherapy dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase.
​
The primary outcome measures are safety as measured by incidence of TEAEs and DLTs as determined by incidence of severity of adverse events. Secondary outcome measures include 1) PDs, which are measured through changes in immune cell populations in the periphery relative to baseline; 2) PKs as measured by detection of the number of RTX-321 cells using flow cytometry; and 3) antitumor activity of RTX-321 as measured by PFS and overall response rate.
The figure below, as of January 11, 2021, summarizes our planned development of RTX-321 for the treatment of patients with HPV 16-positive cancers.

22



​
Further development of RTX-321 will investigate the efficacy of RTX-321 in the specific patient populations studied in the Phase 1 trial, including HPV 16-positive HNSCC and cervical cancer. In the setting of anal cancer, it is anticipated that the assessment of HPV 16 status could be foregone with the rate of positivity in the population exceeding 80%. Future development of RTX-321 will be conducted in specific populations, including the three diseases included in the Phase 1 trial (HNSCC, cervical cancer and anal cancer), as well as other rarer cancer populations with association with the HPV 16 virus, including penile, endometrial and vulvar cancers. 
Autoimmune diseases
RCT product candidates for the induction of antigen-specific tolerance
Current therapies and their limitations
Over the past two decades, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of a range of autoimmune disorders with many patients enjoying an improvement in quality of life as a result. Despite their success, current therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases are non-specifically immunosuppressive and expose patients to an increased risk of opportunistic infection and hematological cancers, as is the case with calcineurin inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and anti-TNF antibodies. In up to one third of cases, patients with autoimmune diseases fail to respond to treatment, and even with most responding patients, the disease ultimately loses responsiveness over time.
While the triggers of most autoimmune diseases remain unknown, it is generally understood that disease is the result of a loss of tolerance to one’s own cells. The accepted model of disease assumes a genetic susceptibility triggered by an environmental event, which leads to a breakdown of T cell-mediated immune regulation. In principle, restoration of peripheral tolerance should provide patients with a partial response or a complete cure.
A range of competitive approaches to peripheral tolerance restoration have been investigated over the last few decades. These include the oral administration and direct injection of a protein or peptide with or without immunosuppression, the creation of peptide bearing nanoparticles and the adoptive transfer of engineered regulatory T cells. Thus far, these approaches have not proven to be successful in late-stage clinical trials, but the field continues to progress. Direct administration of peptides and nanoparticles suffer biodistribution, stability, presentation and orientation challenges which limit the effectiveness of cell-cell signaling. To date, adoptive transfer approaches are all autologous and are hampered by some of the same handling and scalability issues that limit the application of other cellular therapies. By contrast, we believe presentation of antigens in or on RCTs by antigen presenting cells in the liver recapitulates the normal process of self/non-self recognition training that would lead to tolerance induction. When compared with contemporary and historical approaches of tolerance induction, RCTs could represent a clinically meaningful step forward.
Tolerance Induction
​
We engineer our RCTs to express specific autoimmune disease-associated antigens either within the cell or on the cell surface to take advantage of how the body normally maintains self-tolerance, thereby retraining the immune system to no longer see self-antigens as foreign.

In addition, we have the ability to express immune modulating cytokines, enzymes or inhibitory signals, which may have the potential to enhance the tolerogenic effects of our RCTs.

23



We believe RCTs can be designed to more specifically modulate complex counter-regulatory immune responses and enable greater efficacy with lower toxicity, potentially providing treatments for a number of diseases, and, in some cases, potentially even cures. 
​
We continue to advance our preclinical-stage autoimmune program in Type I diabetes.
​
Manufacturing
We have industrialized the production of RCTs by developing and scaling up a manufacturing process by which hematopoietic progenitor cells are expanded, then genetically engineered and subsequently differentiated and matured into enucleated RCTs that express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. The RED PLATFORM allows us to generate a wide variety of allogeneic, ready-to-use RCT product candidates with a universal and proprietary process through the following steps:

(1) | Donors are screened for infectious diseases according to regulatory guidelines and are typed for major blood group antigens. O negative blood donors are selected and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor to mobilize their bone marrow.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells are isolated from universal donor blood, collected by apheresis and purified.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | These precursor cells are transduced using a lentiviral vector encoding one or more chosen biotherapeutic proteins.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | The cells are then exposed to a defined media formulation in a bioreactor to promote further expansion and differentiation until they mature into enucleated reticulocytes. At this stage, the enucleated reticulocytes are RCTs that express one or more biotherapeutic proteins in the cytosol or on the cell surface.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | For RTX-240, the RCTs are purified, formulated and stored at 4°C. For RTX-321, bulk drug substance is frozen before formulation. Frozen drug substance can be thawed and formulated ‘on demand’ in aliquots, and placed in vials.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A single donor is expected to allow us to manufacture up to thousands of doses when we reach full manufacturing capacity. With approximately 7% of the U.S. population having an O negative blood type, we believe that there is ample supply of CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells needed to produce our RCTs. Additionally, due to the inherent properties 

24



of RBCs, RCTs can be manufactured in large bioreactors using our proprietary manufacturing processes, which could result in the cost of goods sold being significantly lower than other cellular therapies.
In connection with our IND applications for RTX-240 and RTX-321, the FDA has reviewed our established manufacturing process capable of producing product candidates for clinical use in accordance with cGMP operations. We expect to be able to use the same or similar manufacturing processes for all our future RCT product candidates, which would enable us to bring RCTs into clinical development in an accelerated manner.
Based on our expertise in red blood cell biology and advice from leading hematologists and blood transfusion experts, we have developed RCT product release criteria to determine the purity, viability, red blood cell identity and potency of each RCT batch. These release criteria have been reviewed and accepted for clinical use by the FDA.
We manufacture RCTs in bioreactors, which enable us to control critical process parameters and thereby produce consistent RCTs that meet the established product release criteria. We are currently working to further increase yields and plan to scale into larger bioreactors for eventual commercialization. We currently use external suppliers for lentiviral vector production but have developed an internal lentiviral vector production process, which may be used in the future.
In addition to the standard RCT manufacturing process, we have developed alternative proprietary processes for engineering hematopoietic precursor cells and maturing these into RCTs. These processes may be utilized in the production of future RCTs.
Expanding our manufacturing capacity and supply chain
To enable us to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, in July 2018, we acquired and began renovating a 135,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI. This manufacturing facility has been operational since January 2020 and is currently providing cGMP clinical supply for our ongoing RTX-240 and RTX-321 clinical trials. 
​
During 2020, the site achieved the following milestones:
​

● | increased productivity in manufacturing of cGMP supply of RTX-240 in 50L bioreactors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased RTX-240 liquid in-vial shelf life from 28 to 52 days;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | for RTX-240, continuously met red blood cell identity (CD233+, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, purity, enucleation cell population) and target product profile criteria (protein expression, cell viability) for clinical supply lots; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | introduced frozen drug substance for the first time as part of the IND application for RTX-321, resulting in a truly off-the-shelf cellular therapy candidate with a potential shelf life of up to several years. Following liquid reformulation, RTX-321 drug product has an in-vial shelf life of 52 days.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities in Smithfield, RI and plan to stage additional investments based on future supply needs. Accordingly, we expect this facility to be able to provide cGMP clinical supply for future clinical trials, as well as commercial product if regulatory approval is received. 
​
Suppliers 
​
We have entered into agreements with a supplier of cGMP grade plasmids for lentiviral production, as well as a supplier of lentiviral vector. We have secured cGMP lentiviral vector production slots in support of our ongoing RTX-240 and RTX-321 clinical trials, and we are continually securing additional lentiviral production slots for the additional RCT product candidates that are projected to enter clinical trials.

RTX-240 and RTX-224 for certain oncology indications
We have developed RTX-240, an RCT product candidate that is engineered to express 4-1BBL and IL-15TP (a fusion of the cytokine IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha), for the treatment of patients suffering from hematological or solid cancers that have lost response to conventional therapies, including anti-PD-1 therapies or other immune-oncology therapies, and to prevent the emergence of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and other immune-oncology therapies. RTX-240 induces the proliferation and activation of two key target cells, the NK cell and CD8+ memory T cell. Our development strategy for RTX-240 is focused on identifying those patient populations where the tumor would be susceptible to such a mechanism utilizing the biology of the NK response, as well as the memory T cells.
We have developed RTX-224, an RCT product candidate that is engineered to co-express 4-1BBL and IL-12, for the treatment of patients suffering from solid tumors where a T cell mechanism of action is critical. The introduction of membrane-bound IL-12 is thought to have very broad T cell-based activation, including all subsets of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, while sparing the induction of the CD4+ regulatory T cells.

These platform technologies, and our intellectual property protection related thereto, are broadly applicable to our RCT product candidates.
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in additional jurisdictions where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Japan.
Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the 

28



earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

Trade secrets
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
Licenses
In January 2016, we entered into an exclusive license with WIBR that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under patent rights comprising two patent families to research, develop, make and commercialize products and processes covered by such patent rights for all uses, or the WIBR License. The WIBR License was amended in December 2017 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a third patent family jointly owned by WIBR and Tufts University, or Tufts. The WIBR License was amended in July 2018 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a fourth patent family owned by WIBR. As of January 31, 2021, the patent portfolio licensed from WIBR includes two issued U.S. patents, and over 15 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and issued foreign patents. We expect these WIBR-licensed patent applications, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions that may be obtained.

29



The patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License are directed, in part, to the in vitro production of RBCs and the use of the enzyme sortase to conjugate a protein of interest to the cell surface. We have certain diligence obligations under the WIBR License, which include using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize any products under the patents and achieving certain milestones as further described in the WIBR License. Additionally, under certain circumstances, we may in the future be obligated to negotiate in good faith field-limited, non-exclusive sublicenses to allow third parties to exploit the patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License to develop and commercialize products that are not competitive with our products or product candidates.
WIBR retains the right with respect to all four patent families licensed to us to (i) practice the patent rights licensed under the agreement for research, teaching and educational purposes, including sponsored research and collaboration, and (ii) grant non-exclusive licenses to academic and not-for-profit research institutes to practice under the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes (excluding sponsored research), while Tufts retains such rights only with respect to the patent family that it co-owns. Pursuant to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency agreement between WIBR and a global biopharmaceutical company, the biopharmaceutical company funded research resulting in one of the licensed patent families and WIBR granted the biopharmaceutical company the right to retain a worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use this patent family for research and development purposes. In addition, under the WIBR agreement, the U.S. federal government retains a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to practice any government-funded invention claimed in the patent rights, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §§ 201-211 and Executive Order 12591.
As partial consideration for the license, we issued 366,667 shares of our common stock to WIBR. In addition, we paid WIBR an upfront payment and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, creditable against royalties and milestone payments. We are obligated to pay to WIBR low single-digit royalties based on annual net sales by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products and licensed services that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights at the time and in the country of sale. On a country-by-country basis, upon expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country, our license becomes royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable with respect to such country. Based on the progress we make in the advancement of products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are required to pay to WIBR a percentage of the non-royalty payments that we receive from sublicensees of the patent rights licensed to us by WIBR. This percentage varies from low single digits to low double digits and will be based upon the clinical stage of the product at the time of the sublicense.
Under the WIBR License, WIBR controls the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed to us and we have the right to review and comment on such prosecution and maintenance. We have the first right to enforce the patent rights licensed to us against third party infringers. We may terminate the WIBR License for convenience upon three months prior written notice to WIBR. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License upon written notice to us if we, along with our affiliates and sublicensees, cease to carry on business related to the WIBR License for more than six months. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License for our material breach that remains uncured for sixty days after receiving notice thereof, if we fail to pay amounts due under the agreement within thirty days after receiving notice of such failure, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patent rights.
Competition
In addition to the product specific competitors for each of the initial targets we are pursuing that are described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we have identified at least two companies that are leveraging the RBC as a platform: Erytech Pharma SA and SQZ Biotechnologies Company. 
Erytech Pharma SA is using reversible hypotonic and hypertonic osmotic stress to encapsulate drug substances inside of red blood cells to create product candidates for use in cancer and orphan diseases. 
SQZ Biotechnologies Company is pursuing applications in cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases using a variety of cell-based approaches, including red blood cells. The company’s red blood cell approach for cancer is to 

30



deliver antigens, as well as adjuvants inside of red blood cells to drive an immune response against target antigens. For autoimmune diseases, SQZ delivers antigens inside of red blood cells to be processed and induce tolerance. 
Erytech Pharma SA and SQZ Biotechnologies Company are both developing product candidates using red blood cells loaded with agents inside the cells. In contrast, our flexible RED PLATFORM allows for expression of multiple proteins, for example, cytokines and other agents, inside or on the cell surface of red blood cells.
Outside of RBC-based competition, there are a number of companies competing in our target therapeutic areas. Within oncology, multiple large and small companies are developing novel immune stimulatory agents, such as Nektar Therapeutics, which is developing a polymer-conjugated IL-15, and Genmab, which is developing a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and 4-1BB. Others are developing activated and engineered NK cell product candidates as cancer therapeutics against both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, such as Fate Therapeutics. Many companies are developing therapies to generate antigen-specific immune responses against HPV-positive cancers, such as BioNTech SE using RNA and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. using DNA-based therapy. Finally, multiple companies are developing novel approaches to restore immune tolerance, such as Anokion SA, which is developing engineered proteins for celiac disease, Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. 
In addition to the companies described above, we anticipate competing with the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, such as Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Amgen, Inc., F. Hoffman-La Roche AG (Roche), Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer, Inc.
Government regulation 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as RTX-240 and RTX-321, and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. biological product development 
In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulations thereunder. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31




● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and, if applicable, current good tissue practices, or cGTP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biological product in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for RTX-240, RTX-321 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety and toxicology studies.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold before such time. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. If the FDA’s concerns are not resolved, submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Each clinical trial of investigational cell and gene therapies must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, for each clinical site. IBCs were established under the National Institute of Health, or NIH, Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules to provide local review and oversight of nearly all forms of research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. In its review, the IBC assesses biosafety issues, specifically, 

32



safety practices and containment procedures, related to the investigational product and clinical study. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Such trials remain subject to FDA and other clinical trial regulations, and only after FDA, IBC, and other relevant approvals are in place can these protocols proceed. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit and risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in 

33



commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, among other things. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
BLA and FDA review process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, a request for approval to market the biological product for one or more specified indications, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through December 31, 2020, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $2,942,965. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2020 is $332,424. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements and, if applicable, cGTP requirements. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their products with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and cGTP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data as part of the review process, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the process.

34



After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. A product will not be considered the “same drug” if it is clinically superior to a product that has orphan drug exclusivity. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication, but which could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended 

35



to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive interaction and guidance from the FDA. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval pathway for certain regenerative medicine therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative medicine therapies do not include those human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the PHSA and 21 CFR Part 1271. The program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as an RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The FDA generally expects preliminary clinical evidence to be obtained from clinical investigations specifically conducted to assess the effects of the therapy on a serious condition, which could include well-designed retrospective studies or clinical case series, as appropriate, but the RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over existing therapies. Advantages of RMAT designation include all of the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. In addition, a product that receives RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review, and the FDA may grant accelerated approval to products that have RMAT designation based on (1) previously 

36



agreed-upon surrogate or intermediate endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit; or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites, as appropriate. Another benefit of RMAT designation is that may enable to the sponsor to meet post-approval requirements beyond the completion of traditional confirmatory clinical trials. The FDA has indicated that post-approval requirements for RMATs receiving accelerated approval can potentially be met through:

● | clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with breakthrough designation, an RMAT designation is not the same as an approval and does not change the statutory standards for demonstration of safety and effectiveness needed for marketing approval.
Pediatric information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain BLAs and certain supplements to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial or trials that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early-phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-marketing requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.

FDA regulations require that biological products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations and, in some cases, cGTP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP and cGTP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP and cGTP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP or cGTP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP and cGTP compliance. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of RTX-240 and RTX-321 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-

38



Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biological product is granted four- and twelve-year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Union drug development
In the E.U., our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.

39



Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the E.U. are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the E.U. clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the E.U., the E.U. Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the E.U. countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority and one or more Ethics Committees.
The E.U. clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation E.U. No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the E.U. will be identical.
European Union drug marketing
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States discussed below, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of E.U. Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain E.U. Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and the regulatory authorities of the individual E.U. Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the E.U. Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
European Union drug review and approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of all 28 E.U. Member States (except Croatia) and also Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the E.U.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

40




States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Union new chemical entity exclusivity
In the E.U., new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the E.U. from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
European Union orphan drug designation and exclusivity
In the E.U., the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the E.U. community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
European data collection
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, in the E.U. is governed by, as of May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the E.U. Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces data protection requirements in the E.U. and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
In addition, further to the United Kingdom's (UK) exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the 'UK GDPR'). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The UK, however, is now regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR which means 

41



that transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognised by the EU’s GDPR, has been put in place. However, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the UK and the EEA for a six-month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing).
For more information related to GDPR, please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to government regulation—European data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal information.”
Rest of the world regulation
For other countries outside of the E.U., U.K. and the United States, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Additional laws and regulations governing international operations
If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.

Coverage and reimbursement
Successful commercialization of new drug and biologic products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug and biologic products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. 
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford many treatments. Sales of these or other product candidates that we may identify will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.
In the United States, the important decisions about reimbursement for new drug and biologic products are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as major health insurers. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug and biologic products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug and biologic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:


● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug and biologic benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs and biologics. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs and biologics, and each drug plan can develop its own formulary that identifies which drugs and biologics it will cover, and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include products within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs and biologics in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs and biologics may increase demand for products for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies 

43



only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug or biologic product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. Further, on December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a recent reimbursement formula change instituted by CMS under the 340B program. The HHS appealed the lower court’s decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on July 15, 2019. On July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court’s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary’s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the NIH, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
These current laws and state and federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control as part of national health systems in many countries. In general, the prices of drug and biologic products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug and biologic products, but monitor and control company profits. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States.
Other healthcare laws
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose a pharmaceutical or biologics manufacturer to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or biologic manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit receive, offer, provide or pay any
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

44




remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward either referrals of individuals for, or the purchase, recommendation, arrangement, order or prescription of any good or service, including any particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violation of the statute does not require actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.

relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug and biologic manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, individual imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely be subject to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court; the Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in early 2021. With the implementation of the ACA ongoing, the law is likely to continue the trend of downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Both new legislative reforms, as well as actions taken by the Biden administration, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” which will shift costs for name brand drugs away from Part D participants back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits in the event any of our products receive FDA approval and CMS reimbursement. Similarly, CMS recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Additionally, CMS has finalized a rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D 

46



prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was became effective January 1, 2019.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will continue into the future.
Other Regulations
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In addition, our leasing and operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to certain U.S. environmental laws and regulations, under which current or previous owners or operators of real property and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination caused by hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2021, we had 204 full-time employees, all of whom are in the United States, and 165 of our employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be positive. 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development programs. In addition, we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.
