Item 1.    BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY

We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel biologic therapies for the treatment of rare immune-mediated diseases. Our goal is to develop molecules that drive significant advances in the control over or cure of immune-driven disease. To do this, we draw on our strong analytic heritage to interrogate immune biology to identify and validate high-priority targets. We then use our protein design expertise to refine the structure of our biological product candidates to optimize their potency and pharmacokinetics, while minimizing potential toxicities.
There are approximately 45 rare autoimmune disorders driven by autoantibodies, and we estimate there are one to two million patients in the United States with these rare disorders. We are developing therapeutics for autoimmune diseases with a focus on these diseases. Our initial focus in immune biology has been to explore the interaction between antibodies, which are components of the humoral immune system, and the receptors which bind to the fragment crystallizable, or Fc, region of antibodies and modulate the immune cascade. Our objective is to reduce immune driven tissue damage resulting from autoimmune disease. Specifically, we have been working with the Fc gamma receptor system which controls immune activation, and the neonatal Fc receptor, or FcRn, system which recycles immunoglobulin G, or IgG, to preserve its half-life. By gaining a deeper understanding of IVIg and immune complex driven diseases, we have designed two novel recombinant therapeutic candidates, M281 and M230. We utilized our proprietary sialylation technology, a method to add sialic acid to protein, to create M254, a high potency alternative to IVIg that we believe improves upon the limitations of that therapeutic approach. All three of these programs are currently in clinical development, all of which have shown high potency against their respective targets in preclinical studies, and all with unique, differentiated and carefully designed biologic structures. The targets our programs modulate have the potential to impact core areas of humoral immune activation, and therefore we believe our programs have the potential to treat a variety of immune-mediated disorders.
Our research platform continues to develop additional programs to build our pipeline. We have two areas of focused research activities. The first area of focus is to continue to explore immune biology, expanding our efforts beyond the Fc gamma and FcRn systems. This effort has yielded several promising leads which we hope to add to our development pipeline in the next several years.
The second area of focus seeks to exploit the properties of our uniquely designed product candidates to create molecules that more effectively modulate established targets. This effort seeks to reduce program risk by pursuing well known biology with well-engineered biologics. We have two areas of focus, based on two of our technologies used for programs in the clinic:

1. | Sialylation Platform - We have optimized our tools for the terminal sialylation of glycans attached to biologic molecules during our development of M254, our investigational tetra-sialylated IgG program now in the clinic. This technology can be used for the sialylation of other biologics. Most notably, this technology can be used to create effective sialylation on recombinant versions of blood proteins. Preclinical studies have shown that this approach can increase their observed half-life and we believe our technology could enable recombinant versions of these proteins, if successfully developed and approved, to become viable long-acting versions of the original plasma products.


2. | SIFbody Platform - We are seeking to take advantage of the enhanced Fc gamma receptor binding we have seen in our M230 trimer program to create more potent versions of antibodies which activate the immune system through their Fc signaling and binding. We have observed significant enhancements in potency in laboratory models using CD38 SIFbody molecules compared to existing marketed CD38 antibodies, and have nominated a candidate, M267, for development. There are over 40 products marketed or in development whose efficacy is mediated by their Fc activities and which we believe may be enhanced with this technology.

We believe both of these platforms have the potential to yield multiple programs for our own, or potential collaboration partner’s, pipelines in the coming years.

Our Legacy Business
Prior to 2018, Momenta had the dual focus of developing novel drug candidates and nurturing a portfolio of biosimilar and complex generic products and product candidates. In the beginning of 2018, we engaged in a strategic review of our business and made the decision that shareholder value could be enhanced by shifting our future investments to fully support our promising novel drug portfolio. Following this strategic review, we made the decision in September 2018 to restructure the company. 
While we have terminated all future development of any new or early stage biosimilar and complex generic products, we have retained our commercial partnership with Sandoz AG, or Sandoz, for our generic versions of COPAXONE and LOVENOX, which are approved products. We believe that Sandoz's sales of GLATOPA, our generic version of COPAXONE, can generate cash flow to help fund our novel pipeline. In addition, we are developing an EYLEA biosimilar, in collaboration with Mylan Ireland Limited, or Mylan, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Mylan N.V., which is currently in a pivotal clinical trial in patients. If the results from this study are supportive, we believe this program has the potential to launch in the 2023 time frame and help fund our novel portfolio. We have ceased active development activities for, and do not anticipate any future investments in, our wholly owned HUMIRA biosimilar, due to changes in market opportunity relating to its launch.
Today, we have two product development areas: Novel Therapeutic Candidates and Legacy Products, which include biosimilars and complex generics. A summary of our programs in each area is set forth below.
Novel Therapeutics
Our Approach 
We believe that dramatic progress in the treatment of autoimmune disease can be achieved through a combination of focused research which provides a deep understanding of the pathways of the immune system and a careful design of biologic therapeutics that optimally interact with and influence these pathways. Our approach to immune biology has yielded insights into the interactions of antibodies and the Fc receptors that modulate the immune system, leading to three programs we have in the clinic. Our deep experience in protein design has yielded what we believe are best in class drug candidates. We are currently working to expand our research, and our portfolio of product candidates, into additional areas of immune biology.
Autoimmune Diseases
Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by the formation of autoantibodies that bind self-antigens to form immune complexes. These immune complexes can recruit and activate immune cells leading to tissue inflammation and damage. Few therapeutic agents exist today that interfere directly with these autoantibodies or immune complex-immune cell activation processes, or that effectively modulate the immune cascades that result. The most commonly used treatments for autoantibody-driven disease are systemic immunosuppressants, which do not specifically target disease pathogenesis and which carry significant safety risks such as opportunistic infection and cancer. In addition to these treatments, intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIg, a therapeutic drug product that contains pooled IgG antibodies purified from blood plasma is often used to treat certain inflammatory diseases. We believe that, despite currently available agents that do offer some relief for patients, there is an unmet medical need in patients with immune-mediated diseases.
We believe our novel product candidates could be capable of treating a large number of immune-mediated disorders driven by autoantibodies, immune complexes, and Fc receptor biology. 
Our Programs
M281 (Nipocalimab) - Anti-FcRn Candidate 
M281 is a fully-human anti-neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), aglycosylated immunoglobulin G, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody, designed to reduce circulating IgG antibodies by completely blocking endogenous IgG recycling via FcRn. M281 has exhibited high affinity to human and non-human FcRn in nonclinical studies and shown selective induction of human and non-human IgG clearance. Based on this data, we believe M281 has the potential for use as an acute or chronic/intermittent therapy in a broad range of autoantibody driven disease. 
A Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of M281 in 114 normal healthy volunteers was initiated in June 2016. The full results of the Phase 1 study were published on November 7, 2018. A total of 50 patients were enrolled in both the single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose portions of the study, both of which showed predictable pharmacokinetics, and commensurate, controllable and reproducible reductions in circulating IgG. The data showed M281 could achieve a full receptor occupancy with a single dose and a greater than 80% reduction in circulating IgG antibodies with a mean reduction of 84%. M281 was well tolerated at all dose levels and no serious adverse events or unexpected safety findings were observed in either portion of the study.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced Vivacity-MG, our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis, or gMG, who have insufficient clinical response to the standard-of-care treatment. The primary endpoints for this study are to evaluate safety and tolerability and to evaluate efficacy as measured by the change from baseline to day 57 in the total Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living score. We estimate that there are approximately 65,000 patients in the United States with gMG. 
Also in the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced Unity, our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of women at high risk for early onset hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, or HDFN. The primary endpoints of this study are to evaluate safety and tolerability and to evaluate efficacy as measured by the proportion of patients with live births at or after gestational age 32 weeks without interuterine transfusion. We estimate that there are between 4,000 to 8,000 patients in the United States with HDFN.
 In the third quarter of 2019, we commenced Energy Study, our Phase 2/3 clinical trial in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or wAIHA. The primary endpoint for this trial is based on the change from baseline in hemoglobin levels, with secondary endpoints including markers of hemolysis and a fatigue scale. We estimate that there are approximately 45,000 patients with wAIHA in the United States with a risk of premature death of up to 8%. 

In July 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for our HDFN and wAIHA indications, which is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical need. 
M254 - Hyper-sialylated IgG Candidate
M254 is a hyper-sialylated immunoglobulin designed as a high potency alternative to IVIg, a therapeutic drug product that contains pooled, human immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies purified from blood plasma. IVIg is used to treat several inflammatory diseases, including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. In nonclinical studies, M254 has been shown to have up to ten times more enhanced anti-inflammatory activity than IVIg in a variety of animal models of autoimmune disease. If approved, we believe M254 has the potential to remediate the limitations of IVIg associated with its dosing and adverse event profile because sialylation of the Fc region of IgG has been seen to augment the anti-inflammatory attributes of IVIg. We estimate that in 2018, sales of IVIg were greater than $6.0 billion for autoimmune diseases.
We initiated a multi-part Phase 1/2 proof of concept clinical study in normal, healthy volunteers and patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP in early 2019. The primary objectives of this study are to understand the safety and tolerability of M254 in healthy volunteers and ITP patients, to determine if M254 administration results in an increase in platelet levels in ITP patients, and the relative ratio of any platelet increase within patients to IVIg. We estimate that chronic ITP affects approximately 30,000 to 40,000 patients in the United States. 
M230 (CSL730) - Recombinant Fc Multimer Candidate
M230 is a novel recombinant trivalent human IgG1 Fc multimer containing three IgG Fc regions joined to maximize activity. Nonclinical data have shown that M230 enhanced the molecules' avidity for the Fc receptors matching the potency and efficacy of IVIg at significantly lower doses.
Pursuant to the License and Option Agreement, effective February 17, 2017, with CSL Behring Recombinant Facility AG, or CSL, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CSL Limited, we granted CSL an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize M230. In August 2017, we exercised our 50% co-funding option, which is discussed further in Note 10 "License Agreements and Collaborative Arrangements ." The terms of our CSL collaboration are further discussed below under "Collaborations and Licenses—CSL." 
CSL's Phase I clinical program in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety and tolerability of M230 is continuing and CSL anticipates introducing a subcutaneous formulation into the program in 2020.
Legacy Products
Our Approach
In October 2018, we announced and later completed a restructuring of our business in order to focus the majority of our resources on our promising new drug pipeline. Prior to that restructuring, we were heavily involved in developing a portfolio of biosimilar and complex generic products. In connection with the restructuring, we have terminated all development of early stage biosimilar and complex generic programs, and have only retained our late stage or commercial products in these business areas. The programs remaining in our portfolio are a biosimilar program for EYLEA (the only remaining program in our Mylan collaboration), which is currently in Phase 3, and our complex generics, GLATOPA, a generic to COPAXONE, and Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, a generic to LOVENOX. Both GLATOPA and Enoxaparin Sodium Injection are marketed by our collaboration partner, Sandoz. The retained late stage programs, with the exception of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, which is not currently marketed and for which we expect minimal revenues, provide the potential for revenue to help fund our growing novel drug pipeline and, with the majority of development activities behind us, do not require a large staff to support. We have ceased active development activities for, and do not anticipate any future investments in, our wholly owned HUMIRA biosimilar, due to changes in market opportunity relating to its launch. 
Our Programs
M710—Biosimilar EYLEA® (aflibercept) Candidate
M710 is being developed as a biosimilar of EYLEA. EYLEA is the market leading vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients with DME. 

M710 is being developed in collaboration with Mylan. Under our collaboration agreement, we and Mylan share equally costs and profits (losses) for M710. We and Mylan will share development and manufacturing responsibilities, and Mylan will lead commercialization of M710, if approved. The terms of our Mylan collaboration are further discussed below under "Collaborations and Licenses—Mylan."
In August 2018, Mylan initiated dosing of patients in the United States in our pivotal clinical trial. In December 2018 and February 2019, Mylan initiated dosing of patients in the European Union and Japan, respectively. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, active-control, multi-center study in patients with diabetic macular edema to compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of M710 to EYLEA. Subject to development, marketing approval, patent considerations and litigation timelines, we expect U.S. market formation for biosimilar versions of EYLEA to be in the 2023 time frame.
EYLEA is marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the United States and by Bayer HealthCare in the EU and rest of the world. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reported approximately $7.5 billion in worldwide sales of EYLEA in 2019, including $4.6 billion in the United States.
GLATOPA® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL—Generic Once-daily COPAXONE® (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL is a generic version of once-daily COPAXONE 20 mg/mL indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration. COPAXONE is available in both a once-daily 20 mg/mL formulation, which was approved by the FDA in 1996, and a three-times-weekly 40 mg/mL formulation, which was approved in 2014. COPAXONE is marketed in the United States by Teva Neuroscience, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL was approved by the FDA in April 2015 and was launched in June 2015. GLATOPA 20 mg/mL, the first "AP" rated, substitutable generic equivalent of once-daily COPAXONE, and was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with Sandoz, the generic pharmaceuticals division of Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis. Under our collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL, and we earn 50% of contractually defined profits on GLATOPA 20 mg/mL sales. The terms of our Sandoz collaboration for GLATOPA 20 mg/mL are further discussed below under "Collaborations and Licenses."
GLATOPA® (glatiramer acetate injection) 40 mg/mL—Generic Three-times-weekly COPAXONE® (glatiramer acetate injection) 40 mg/mL
GLATOPA 40 mg/mL is a generic version of three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. GLATOPA 40 mg/mL was developed in collaboration with Sandoz. Under our collaboration agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercialization of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL and we will earn 50% of contractually defined profits on GLATOPA 40 mg/mL sales. The terms of our Sandoz collaboration for GLATOPA 40 mg/mL are further discussed below under "Collaborations and Licenses—Sandoz."
We announced in February 2018 that GLATOPA 40 mg/mL was approved by the FDA and launched by our collaborator, Sandoz. Legal proceedings related to GLATOPA 40 mg/mL are described below under Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
GLATOPA refers to GLATOPA 20 mg/mL and our generic product for three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL, GLATOPA 40 mg/mL, collectively.
 Since Sandoz’s launch of GLATOPA 40mg/mL in February 2018, we believe Sandoz has encountered aggressive pricing and contracting tactics from competitors, which has limited uptake of the product and as, a result, we expect modest revenues for this product in the future. As of the end of 2019, Teva’s three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL and Mylan N.V.’s three-times-weekly generic equivalent product accounted for approximately 84% of the overall U.S. glatiramer acetate injection market (20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) based on volume prescribed. We estimate that the number of prescriptions for GLATOPA 20 mg/mL currently represents approximately 35% of the once-daily 20 mg/mL U.S. glatiramer acetate market.
Teva reported $1.0 billion and $1.7 billion in U.S. sales of COPAXONE (combined 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Enoxaparin Sodium Injection—Generic LOVENOX®
Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is a generic version of LOVENOX indicated for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. LOVENOX is marketed in the United States by Sanofi. Our Enoxaparin Sodium Injection was developed and is being commercialized in the United States in collaboration with Sandoz. Under our amended 2003 collaboration agreement with Sandoz, or the 2003 Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible 

for commercialization of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and we earn 50% of contractually defined profits on Enoxaparin Sodium Injection sales. 
In July 2018, Sandoz notified its customers and the FDA that it will discontinue supplying Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. Sandoz continues to evaluate alternate acceptable contract manufacturers at a price point that will allow for profitable and competitive sales and may decide to relaunch Enoxaparin Sodium Injection at a later date following regulatory approval. We expect future revenues from Sandoz' sales of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, if any, to be minimal.
Legal Proceedings related to Enoxaparin Sodium Injection are described under Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
M923—Biosimilar HUMIRA® (adalimumab) Candidate
We have developed M923 as a biosimilar of HUMIRA. HUMIRA is a monoclonal antibody that can bind to a substance in the body known as tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, thereby inhibiting the known effect of TNF as a potent mediator of inflammation. HUMIRA is indicated for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, among other diseases. HUMIRA is the largest selling therapeutic in the world. HUMIRA is marketed globally by AbbVie Inc, or AbbVie. 
On November 6, 2018, we executed global licensing agreements with AbbVie with respect to M923, pursuant to which, subject to approval by health regulatory authorities, we may launch M923 in the United States in mid to late 2023. We have ceased active development activities for, and do not anticipate any future investments in, M923, due to changes in market opportunity relating to its launch.
Legal proceedings related to M923 are described under Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Collaborations and Licenses
CSL 
We and CSL entered into a License and Option Agreement, or the CSL License Agreement, effective February 17, 2017, pursuant to which we granted CSL an exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the M230 pre-clinical product candidate, an Fc multimer protein that is a selective immunomodulator of the Fc receptor. The CSL License Agreement also provides, on an exclusive basis, for us and CSL to conduct research on other Fc multimer proteins, and provides CSL the right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these additional research products globally. 
Pursuant to the CSL License Agreement, CSL paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $50.0 million. On August 28, 2017, we exercised our 50% co-funding option. This exercise allows us to participate in a cost-and-profit sharing arrangement, under which we fund 50% of global research and development costs and 50% of U.S. commercialization costs for all products developed, in exchange for a 50% share of U.S. profits and sales-based royalty payments in percentages ranging from a mid-single digit to low-double digits payable for territories outside of the United States for M230 and a named research stage product should that enter development and be commercialized. For the development and commercialization of M230 we are also entitled to up to $297.5 million in contingent clinical, regulatory and sales milestone payments, and additional negotiated milestone payments for a named research stage product should one enter development. The contract allows us to opt-out of the program in the future at our discretion. If we were to do so, our U.S. profit share would be reduced to sales-based royalties ranging from mid-single to low double digits and the milestone payments for which we are eligible would be increased by up to $252.5 million, depending on the timing of our opt-out decision.
Under the CSL License Agreement, we have granted CSL an exclusive license under our intellectual property to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates for all therapeutic indications. CSL has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license under CSL’s intellectual property for our research and development activities pursuant to the CSL License Agreement and our commercialization activities under any co-promotion agreement with CSL. 
We and CSL formed a joint steering committee consisting of an equal number of members from Momenta and CSL, to facilitate the research, development, and commercialization of product candidates. 
The term of the CSL License Agreement commenced on February 17, 2017 and continues until the later of (i) the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to products under the CSL License Agreement, (ii) the date on which we are no longer co-funding development or commercialization of any products and (iii) the date on which we and CSL are not otherwise collaborating on the development and commercialization of products or product candidates. CSL may terminate the CSL License Agreement on a product-by-product basis subject to notice periods and certain circumstances related to clinical 

development. We may terminate the CSL License Agreement under certain circumstances related to the development of M230 and if no activities are being conducted under the CSL License Agreement. Either party may terminate the CSL License Agreement (i) on a product-by-product basis if certain patent challenges are made, (ii) on a product-by-product basis for material breaches, or (iii) due to the other party’s bankruptcy. Upon termination of the CSL License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the licenses granted under the CSL License Agreement terminate. In addition, dependent upon the circumstances under which the CSL License Agreement is terminated, we or CSL have the right to continue the research, development, and commercialization of terminated products, including rights to certain data, for the continued development and sale of terminated products and, subject to certain limitations, obligations to make sales-based royalty payments to the other party. 
CSL's obligations under the CSL License Agreement are guaranteed by its parent company, CSL Limited.
Mylan
We and Mylan, entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, effective February 9, 2016, pursuant to which we and Mylan agreed to collaborate exclusively, on a worldwide basis, to develop, manufacture and commercialize six of our biosimilar candidates, including M834 and M710.
In November 2018, we delivered a formal notice of the partial termination of the Mylan Collaboration Agreement with respect to five of our collaboration programs. As a result, we will only continue to advance our late-stage biosimilar candidate M710, our proposed biosimilar to EYLEA under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement. 
Under the terms of the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, Mylan paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $45 million. In addition, we and Mylan agreed to share equally costs (including development, manufacturing, commercialization and certain legal expenses) and profits (losses) with respect to such product candidates, with Mylan funding its share of collaboration expenses incurred by us.
For our remaining product candidate, M710, we and Mylan both have the right to terminate the program at our own convenience. As with the five discontinued collaboration programs, if one party decides not to continue development, manufacture and commercialization of M710 under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, the other party will have the right to continue the development, manufacture and commercialization of such product candidate, and the terminating party will need to continue to fund it share of expenses for a pre-specified period, depending on the stage of the product at the time of termination.
Under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, we granted Mylan an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the product candidates for all therapeutic indications, and Mylan has granted us a co-exclusive license under Mylan's intellectual property rights for us to perform our development and manufacturing activities under the product work plans agreed by the parties, and to perform certain commercialization activities to be agreed by the Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, for such product candidates if we exercise our co-commercialization option described below. We and Mylan have established a joint steering committee, or JSC, consisting of an equal number of members from us and Mylan, to oversee and manage the development, manufacture and commercialization of product candidates under the collaboration. Unless otherwise determined by the JSC, it is anticipated that, in collaboration with the other party, (a) we will be primarily responsible for nonclinical development activities and initial clinical development activities for the product candidates; and regulatory activities for the product candidates in the United States through regulatory approval; and (b) Mylan will be primarily responsible for additional (pivotal or phase 3 equivalent) clinical development activities for the product candidates; regulatory activities for the product candidates outside the United States; and regulatory activities for products in the United States after regulatory approval, when all marketing authorizations for the products in the United States will be transferred to Mylan. As provided in the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, Mylan will commercialize any approved products, with us having an option to co-commercialize, in a supporting commercial role, any approved products in the United States. The JSC will allocate responsibilities for other activities under the collaboration.
The term of the collaboration will continue throughout the development and commercialization of M710, on a country-by-country basis, until development and commercialization by or on behalf of us and Mylan pursuant to the Mylan Collaboration Agreement has ceased for a continuous period of two years in a given country, unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the Mylan Collaboration Agreement.
The Mylan Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party for breach by, or bankruptcy of, the other party; for its convenience; or for certain activities involving competing products or the challenge of certain patents. Other than in the case of a termination for convenience, the terminating party shall have the right to continue the development, manufacture and commercialization of the terminated products in the terminated countries. 
Sandoz
In 2006 and 2007, we entered into a series of agreements, including a collaboration and license agreement, as amended, or the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, with Sandoz and a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement with Novartis. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, we and Sandoz agreed to exclusively collaborate on the development and commercialization of GLATOPA, among other potential products. Costs, including development costs and the costs of clinical studies, are borne by the parties in varying proportions depending on the type of expense. For GLATOPA, we were generally responsible for all of the development costs in the United States. For GLATOPA outside of the United States, we shared development costs in proportion to our profit sharing interest, unless otherwise agreed. We are reimbursed at a contractual FTE rate for any full-time equivalent employee expenses as well as any external costs incurred in the development of products to the extent development costs are born by Sandoz. All commercialization costs are to be borne by Sandoz as they are incurred for all products.
Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, as amended in November, 2017, Sandoz has granted us an exclusive license under its intellectual property rights, and we have granted an exclusive license under our know-how and data to the GLATOPA products and a non-exclusive license under our intellectual patent rights to develop and commercialize such products for all medical indications in the relevant regions. We have agreed to provide development and related services on a commercially reasonable best-efforts basis, which includes developing a manufacturing process to make the products, scaling up the process, contributing to the preparation of regulatory filings, further scaling up the manufacturing process to commercial scale, and related development of intellectual property. We have the right to participate in a joint steering committee, which is responsible for overseeing development, legal and commercial activities and which prepares and approves the annual collaboration plans. Sandoz is responsible for commercialization activities and exclusively distributes and markets the products.
The term of the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement extends throughout the development and commercialization of the products until the last sale of the products, unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the provisions of the agreement. The 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement may be terminated if either party breaches the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement or files for bankruptcy.
Sandoz commenced United States sales of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL in June 2015 and of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL in February 2018. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, we earn 50% of contractually defined profits on Sandoz' worldwide net sales of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL and of GLATOPA 40 mg/mL. Profits on net sales of GLATOPA are calculated by deducting from net sales the costs of goods sold and an allowance for selling, general and administrative costs, which is a contractual percentage of net sales. With respect to GLATOPA, Sandoz is responsible for funding all of the legal expenses incurred under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, except for our FTE costs with respect to certain legal activities for GLATOPA; however, a portion of certain legal expenses, including any patent infringement damages, can be offset by Sandoz against the profit-sharing amounts in proportion to our 50% profit sharing interest. In 2015, we earned a $10.0 million regulatory milestone payment upon GLATOPA 20 mg/mL receiving sole FDA approval and an additional $10.0 million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of GLATOPA 20 mg/mL. In July 2017, we earned a $10.0 million commercial milestone payment in connection with GLATOPA 20 mg/mL's being the sole FDA-approved generic of COPAXONE when earned and achieving a certain level of contractually defined profits in the United States, for which Sandoz was entitled to reduce our contractually defined profits by a corresponding amount. Following FDA approval of Mylan N.V.'s generic equivalents of COPAXONE 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, which Mylan N.V. announced in October 2017, we are no longer eligible to earn $80.0 million in future post-launch commercial milestones; however, we may still be eligible to receive up to $30.0 million in sales-based milestones for GLATOPA in the United States, although we believe that it is unlikely the performance based milestones will be achieved. None of these payments, once received, is refundable and there are no general rights of return in the arrangement. Sandoz has agreed to indemnify us for various claims, and a certain portion of such costs may be offset against certain future payments received by us.
Patents and Property Rights
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technology and product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We license or own a patent portfolio of around 150 patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents as well as foreign counterparts to certain of the United States patents and patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes issued or pending claims covering:

• | composition of matter, methods of use, and methods of making novel therapeutics for autoimmune disease, including our novel product candidates such as M230, M281 and M254;


• | composition of matter, methods of use, and methods of making certain novel low molecular weight heparins;


• | methods and technologies for characterizing complex generics and biosimilars, including our biosimilar HUMIRA candidate;


• | composition of matter and use of certain heparinases, heparinase variants and other enzymes; and


• | methods and technologies for the analysis and synthesis of polysaccharides.

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Moreover, any issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice the patented technology or to commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our patented technology. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our generic, biosimilar and novel products. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate facilities for commercial scale manufacturing of our products. While we have personnel with experience and expertise in manufacturing, as well as process development, analytical development, quality assurance and quality control, we rely on contract manufacturers and our collaboration partners for manufacturing and supply activities. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercial manufacture of GLATOPA. Under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, Mylan is responsible for contracting with contract manufacturers for commercial supply for M710. Under the CSL License Agreement, CSL is responsible for manufacturing activities, except that we are responsible, at CSL's direction, for contracting with contract manufacturers for certain clinical supply of M230. We rely on third parties for the manufacture, process development, analytical development, quality assurance and quality control of all our solely-owned novel product candidates. We also rely upon our collaborators and other third parties, including sole source suppliers, to provide raw materials and ensure that they meet FDA quality standards and related regulatory requirements for our products and product candidates.
We have entered into various agreements with third party contractors for process development, analytical services and manufacturing. In each of our agreements with contractors, we retain ownership of our intellectual property and generally own and/or are assigned ownership of processes, developments, data, results and other intellectual property generated during the course of the performance of each agreement that primarily relate to our products. Where applicable, we are granted non-exclusive licenses to certain contractor intellectual property for purposes of exploiting the products that are the subject of the agreement and in a few instances we grant non-exclusive licenses to the contract manufacturers for use outside of our product area. The agreements also typically contain provisions for both parties to terminate for material breach, bankruptcy and insolvency.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We do not currently have any sales, marketing and distribution capabilities other than strategic sales and marketing expertise. In order for us to commercialize any products we would have to either develop a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or collaborate or contract with third parties that have sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. If our wholly-owned products are approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, we intend to pursue commercialization of the products in the US and potentially other territories. For our product candidates that are subject to collaborations, our collaboration partner has responsibility for commercial activities. Under the 2006 Sandoz Collaboration Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for commercializing GLATOPA. Under the Mylan Collaboration Agreement, we have an option to participate in the commercialization of products, in a supporting commercial role, with Mylan in the United States. Under the CSL License Agreement, CSL is responsible for commercialization of products and we have an option to co-promote products in the United States. 
Regulatory and Legal Matters
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, the European Union and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and exporting and importing of products such as those we are developing.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain market approval of a new drug or biologic varies depending on whether the drug or biologic is a new product whose safety and effectiveness has not previously been demonstrated in humans, or a drug or biologic whose active ingredient(s) and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug or biologic, i.e., biosimilar. Approval of new drugs and biologics follows the new drug application, or NDA, and biologics license application, or BLA routes, respectively. A drug that claims to be the same as an already approved NDA drug may be able to file for approval under the abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, approval pathway. Pursuant to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCI Act, a marketing application may also be submitted for a biosimilar to a biologic previously approved under a BLA seeking approval of the biosimilar under the abbreviated pathway established by Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act.
NDA and BLA Approval Processes for New Drugs and Biologics
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and, in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. The steps required before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States include:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, nonclinical studies and formulation studies under the FDA's good laboratory practices regulations;


• | completion of developmental chemistry, manufacturing and controls activities and manufacture under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must include independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish for an NDA the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for each indication or for a BLA the safety, purity and potency of the biological product for its intended indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity or to meet standards designed to ensure the biologic's continued safety, purity and potency;


• | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of nonclinical and or clinical testing sites;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as nonclinical studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical and stability data, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects or patients in accordance with specific protocols and under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs. Each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and an IRB at each site where the study is conducted must also approve the study. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials usually involve the initial introduction of the investigational drug into humans to evaluate the product's safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. If feasible, Phase 1 studies also attempt to detect any early indication of a drug's potential effectiveness. Phase 2 trials usually involve controlled trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually test a specific hypothesis to evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or a sponsor may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition of product approval. Finally, sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and are subject to civil money penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for failing to meet these obligations.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and control of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refuse to accept and review insufficiently complete applications.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Moreover, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval of a new NDA or BLA, or NDA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug and biologic products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new investigational drugs or biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 

In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug and biologic products intended to treat serious or life‑threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well‑controlled post‑marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre‑approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs and biologics referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug or biologic candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Approval Process for Biosimilars
The BPCI Act created an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars. This abbreviated pathway is codified in Section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act. The Section 351(k) pathway creates a regulatory and legal pathway to encourage the development of biosimilars, which are defined as a biologic that:

• | is "highly similar" to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and


• | has no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency.

Biosimilars may be approved for one or more, and possibly all, indications for which a reference product is approved. In some cases, clinical trial data successfully demonstrating the use of a biosimilar for one indication, and submitted to support approval for that indication, may be extrapolated to support approval for one or more other indications of the reference product. The Section 351(k) pathway further defines a subset of biosimilar products as "interchangeable" if an applicant can demonstrate that:

• | the interchangeable biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and


• | if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biologic product and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without switching.

The types of data that would ordinarily be required in an application to show biosimilarity would include:

• | analytical data and studies to demonstrate similarity to the reference product;


• | nonclinical studies (including toxicity studies); and


• | clinical studies.

The FDA has the discretion to determine whether one or more of these elements are necessary and its guidance to date does not establish a single method for demonstrating biosimilarity but states that the degree of residual uncertainty that remains following analytical and nonclinical research will determine the nature and the extent of clinical studies that may be required. The FDA has implemented a biosimilar user fee program which includes a fee-based meeting process for consultation between applicants and the FDA reviewing division on biosimilar and interchangeable biologics applications under the biosimilar 

approval pathway. It provides for pre-application meetings where the applicant can propose and submit analytical, physicochemical and biologic characterization data along with a proposed development plan. The proposed development plan may have a reduced scope of clinical development based on the nature and extent of the characterization data. There are defined time periods for meetings and written advice. The FDA has published a series of draft and final guidance documents for the development and registration of biosimilars and interchangeable biologics, on topics ranging from demonstrating biosimilarity and interchangeability, non-proprietary naming, labeling and other scientific and regulatory issues. The draft and final guidance documents indicate that the FDA will consider the totality-of-the-evidence developed by an applicant in determining the nature and extent of the development, nonclinical and clinical requirements for a biosimilar or interchangeable biologic product. In addition, the guidance documents confirm the importance of analytical characterization to demonstrating biosimilarity and interchangeability in showing the absence of differences from the reference product. Where differences are identified, uncertainty associated with their clinical meaning or impact is expected to be resolved by nonclinical testing and clinical trials. The greater the similarity, the less uncertainty and the more likely the FDA will authorize an applicant to conduct targeted clinical trials or use extrapolation in support of demonstrating biosimilarity and interchangeability. 
Under the Section 351(k) pathway, the FDA must wait four years after approval of a biological product under a BLA before accepting a filing for a biosimilar version of the reference product, and the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar version of the reference product until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a BLA. The BPCI Act also provides for limited regulatory exclusivity for the first FDA-approved interchangeable biologic with respect to each reference product. This means that the FDA will defer approval of additional interchangeable biologics to the same reference product for defined periods of one year or more.
Upon filing a biosimilar application, an applicant may trigger the patent negotiation and clearance process. Under the BCPI Act provisions, an applicant and the reference product company are required to share information to seek to resolve any patent disputes prior to regulatory approval and launch. A failure to share information or participate in the process has defined consequences that include the loss of the right to seek patent clearance on the applicant's part and the loss of the right to seek lost profits or injunctive relief for infringement on the reference product patent right holder's part. The process, if initiated by the applicant, has several stages, including defining which patents to include in a pre-approval litigation proceeding, initiating litigation, notice 180 days prior to launch of a biosimilar, the initiation of a second round of litigation relating to patents the parties did not include in the first round litigation, and, following approval, litigation on patents brought by the reference product company or other patent holders not involved in the prior patent process.
The BPCI Act is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, we believe its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning will be subject to uncertainty for years to come.
Manufacturing Requirements
Before approving an NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(k) application, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product, and may delay an approval of an application, unless or until it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(k) application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(k) application, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future.
In addition, holders of an approved NDA, BLA, ANDA or Section 351(k) approval are required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

Discovery of problems with a product or failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an IRB of a clinical hold on or termination of studies, the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, restriction on marketing, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and other regulations and enforcement by the federal government as well as the state and foreign governments in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations. Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product and can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third‑party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Payors are also increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for pharmaceutical products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage of such product.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, will impact the law. Any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on the pharmaceutical industry. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2027 and further reductions in Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in those markets. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country.
Under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions and is available at the request of the applicant for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization from one European Union member state (the Reference Member State) may submit an application to the remaining member states. Generally, each member state decides whether to recognize the Reference Member State's approval in its own country.
Related Matters
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA or reimbursed under Medicare by the Center for Medicare Services. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Hazardous Materials
Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals, including radioactive materials and equipment. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Competition
The development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive due to existing product competition at the time of product launch and the development of subsequent therapeutics with different methods of action, efficacy or safety profiles. Many of our competitors, who already market or are developing products similar to those in our portfolio, have considerable experience in product development, obtaining regulatory approval, and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Further, certain of these competitive companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and human resources than we do.
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully develop safe and efficacious products, the timing and scope of regulatory approval of our products and those of our competitors, our ability to collaborate with third parties, our ability to maintain favorable patent protection for our products, our 

ability to obtain market acceptance of our products and our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products at commercially acceptable costs.
Novel Therapeutics
Our novel product pipeline will face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies. Our development work focused on Fc biology has yielded three named product candidates: M281, an anti-FcRn antibody, M254, a hypersialylated IVIg, and M230, an Fc multimer. These candidates face competition from a number of companies. 
M281 Competing FcRn Antagonists
Several companies are developing FcRn targeted agents. UCB has initiated a Phase 3 clinical study in immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP, and myasthenia gravis, or MG, with its anti-FcRn candidate, an IgG4 monoclonal antibody. Argenx’s candidate, a mutated Fc fragment, is in clinical trials for ITP, pemphigus vulgaris and MG. Alexion’s candidate, an IgG4 monoclonal antibody, is expected to enter Phase 2 clinical trials for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or wAIHA, and MG in 2020. Alexion has another molecule, licensed from Affibody, which is in Phase 1. Immunovant’s candidate, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, is in Phase 2 clinical trials in MG and Graves’ ophthalmology, and is expected to begin a Phase 2 clinical trial in wAIHA in 2020. 
M281 Competing in Disease Indications
Momenta has commenced Phase 2 clinical trials in generalized myasthenia gravis, or gMG, and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn or, HDFN and a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in wAIHA. MG treatment is primarily with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, pyridostigmine, and most MG patients also require treatment with immunosuppressive medications. Some patients may require plasma exchange/plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, intravenous immunoglobulin, or Soliris (eculizumab), the sole monoclonal antibody approved for gMG by the FDA. Other complement antagonists in development for MG include agents from Alexion (Ultomiris) and Ra Pharmaceuticals’ zilucoplan. Several other FcRn antagonists are in development for MG. Argenx and UCB are in Phase 3 clinical trials, Immunovant is in Phase 2 clinical trials, and Alexion announced its intention to enter Phase 2 clinical trials in 2020. For HDFN, we are not aware of any other FcRn antagonists in development nor any other novel biologic therapies. In wAIHA, Alexion and Immunovant are conducting or expect to conduct clinical studies of their anti-FcRn agents. Rigel Pharmaceuticals is in a Phase 3 clinical trial with its syk inhibitor fostamatinib.
M254 Competing Immunoglobulins
We are not aware of other companies developing a hypersialylated immunoglobulin. M254 would compete with currently marketed intravenous and subcutaneous IgG products in the United States, including Octagam 5% and Octagam 10% marketed by Octapharma, Gammagard S/D, Gammagard Liquid 10%, Cuvitru 20% and HyQvia 10% marketed by Shire, Privigen Liquid 10%, Carimune NF, Hizentra 20% marketed by CSL Behring, Flebogamma 5% DIF, Gamunex-C, Flebogamma 10% DIF marketed by Grifols, Gammaplex marketed by BPL Holdings, and Bivigam marketed by ADMA Biologics, as well as other intravenous and subcutaneous IgG products marketed ex-US and those that are currently in development.
M254 Competing in Disease Indications
Momenta has commenced a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in ITP. Current therapies for ITP include IVIg, steroids, TPO receptor agonists, a syk inhibitor, Tavalisse (fostamatinib), Rituxanr (rituximab) and splenectomy. Several companies are in development with novel agents to treat ITP patients, including Argenx and UCB with FcRn antagonists, Principia with a BTK inhibitor and Protalex with a form of Staphylococcal protein A.
M230
CSL, our collaboration partner, is conducting a Phase 1 normal healthy volunteer study with M230. Pfizer (licensed from Gliknik), and Shire (licensed from AB Biosciences) have compounds in development that we believe to be mechanistically similar to M230. The Pfizer product recently started a Phase 1 clinical trial. Shire’s product is preclinical. Once the Phase 1 clinical trial for M230 is completed, we will assess the competitive landscape for M230 based on the selected disease indication for further development. 
Biosimilars
If approved, our biosimilar candidate would compete with their applicable branded reference products, other biosimilars to those reference products, as well as other therapies used to treat the indications for which our biosimilar candidate would be approved. 
EYLEA
Coherus, Formycon, Alteogen, Insight Biopharmaceuticals, and Lupin Limited have announced plans to develop a biosimilar to EYLEA.
GLATOPA
GLATOPA 20 mg/mL is a substitutable generic equivalent for, and competes directly with, Teva's once-daily COPAXONE 20 mg/mL. It also competes with Teva's three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. GLATOPA 40 mg/mL is a substitutable generic for, and competes directly with, Teva's three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. In October 2017, Mylan N.V. announced the launch of its generic equivalents to once-daily COPAXONE 20 mg/mL and three-times-weekly COPAXONE 40 mg/mL.
