--------+---------

Overview
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on treating metabolic and inflammatory diseases to minimize their long-term complications and improve the lives of patients. We have an innovative pipeline of first-in-class small molecule clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Our pipeline is led by our programs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (TTP399) and for psoriasis (HPP737). We completed the Simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 1b/2 study supported by JDRF International (“JDRF”), to explore the effects of TTP399 in patients with type 1 diabetes at the beginning of 2020.  In February 2020, we reported positive results from the Phase 2 - Part 2 confirming phase of this study which achieved its primary objective by demonstrating statistically significant improvements in HbA1c (long-term blood sugar) for TTP399 compared to placebo. We are working on the design for pivotal and registrational studies for TTP399, with input from the FDA.  In addition to the pivotal studies of TTP399, we are currently conducting a Phase 1 mechanistic study of TTP399 in patients with type 1 diabetes to determine the impact of TTP399 on ketone body formation during a period of acute insulin withdrawal.
 We are also conducting a multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study of HPP737, an orally administered phosphodiesterase type 4 (“PDE4”) inhibitor, to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of HPP737 in healthy volunteers as part of our psoriasis program.  The goal of this study is to confirm the maximum tolerated dose with minimal or no gastrointestinal (“GI”) intolerance in the form of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. We expect to complete this study in the second quarter of 2021.
 On December 15, 2020, the Company announced that the Phase 2 Elevage study of azeliragon in people with mild Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in cognition as assessed by the 14-item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog14) relative to placebo. The Company is discontinuing its development of azeliragon for Alzheimer’s disease, but is exploring the possibility of azeliragon as a drug candidate for other indications, including the prevention of type 1 diabetes.
 In addition to our internal development programs, we are furthering the clinical development of four other programs: a small molecule GLP-1r agonist, the PDE4 inhibitor, HPP737, a PPAR-delta agonist, and an Nrf2 activator through partnerships with pharmaceutical partners via licensing arrangements. 
 Impact of COVID-19
We have been actively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, employees, patients, partners, suppliers and vendors.  Our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted by COVID-19.  Though our financial results were not significantly impacted, COVID-19 precautions directly and indirectly impacted the timelines for the clinical trials conducted during 2020 and may impact the timelines of the trials currently in process.  
 vTv has continued to make adjustments that allow us to maintain our business operations despite current circumstances, including establishing remote working options for all employees.  Given the current scope of the pandemic, we cannot predict the impact of the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak on future clinical trial and financial results due to a variety of factors, including the continued good health of our employees, the ability of our third party suppliers, vendors, manufacturers and partners to continue to operate and provide services, the ability of our clinical trial sites to continue or resume operations, any further government and/or public actions taken in response to the pandemic and the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 outbreak/pandemic.

 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to advance the development of our differentiated pipeline of orally administered, small molecule drug candidates to treat metabolic and inflammatory diseases to minimize their long-term complications and to improve the lives of patients. As key components of our strategy, we are focused on:

• | Continuing to advance TTP399 as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes. In February 2020, we announced positive results from the Simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP399, assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of TTP399 in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. The study achieved its primary objective by demonstrating statistically significant improvements in HbA1c (long-term blood sugar) for TTP399 compared to placebo. We are working on the design for pivotal and registrational studies for TTP399, with input from the FDA. In addition to the pivotal studies of TTP399, we are currently conducting a Phase 1 mechanistic study in patients with type 1 diabetes to determine the impact of TTP399 on ketone body formation during a period of acute insulin withdrawal.

Our Type 1 Diabetes Program –TTP399
 Diabetes Overview
 Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which a person’s pancreas stops producing insulin (a hormone that enables people to get energy from food). Type 1 diabetes results when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas called beta cells. While the causes of type 1 diabetes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. The onset of type 1 diabetes is not believed to be affected by diet or lifestyle.
Current Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes and Their Limitations
 Patients with type 1 diabetes have difficulty achieving and maintaining consistent glycemic control, defined as HbA1c < 7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). In order to maintain appropriate glycemic control, patients with type 1 diabetes are required to constantly monitor their blood glucose levels, closely manage their diet, and administer insulin via injection in response.  While technology has advanced to help people with type 1 diabetes manage the burden of this monitoring and insulin administration process, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps, patient outcomes have not improved: approximately 80% of people with type 1 diabetes fail to achieve the ADA’s recommended HbA1c levels.  Failure to maintain glycemic control results in dangerous excursions into hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia that are potentially fatal. In addition, the accumulated impact of these glycemic excursions can raise a patient’s risk of potentially serious and life-threatening long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage.
 A number of existing treatment options for type 2 diabetes have been investigated to treat type 1 diabetes, generally without success.  While a pair of SGLT-1/2 and SGLT-2 inhibitors were recently approved in Europe and Japan with label restrictions to certain sub-groups of people with type 1 diabetes, these therapies have not been approved in the U.S. due to safety risks primarily relating to diabetic ketoacidosis (“DKA”).  Alternative therapeutic modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, are under clinical investigation and have demonstrated evidence of the potential to delay the onset of type 1 diabetes.  Such alternatives have not completed clinical development or received regulatory approval nor do they address the unmet need of existing patients with type 1 diabetes or those that eventually become patients with type 1 diabetes following any therapeutic delay in disease onset.
 With insulin and pramlintide injection as the only treatment options approved in the United States for type 1 diabetes, there is an unmet medical need to provide people with type 1 diabetes additional, especially oral, treatment options that can help them to reduce HbA1c, or the incidence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose levels below normal) or DKA.
 The Role of Glucokinase Activation in Diabetes
 Glucokinase (“GK”) is a key regulator of glucose homeostasis and acts as the physiological glucose sensor, changing its conformation, activity, and/or intracellular location in parallel with changes in glucose concentrations. GK has two distinctive characteristics that make it a good choice for blood glucose control. First, its expression is mostly limited to tissues that require glucose-sensing (mainly liver and pancreatic β-cells). Second, GK acts as a biological sensor for changes in serum glucose levels and modulates changes in liver glucose metabolism that in turn regulates the balance between hepatic glucose production and glucose consumption, and modulates changes in insulin secretion by the β-cells.  GK activation is attractive as a potential therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes and has a mechanism of action entirely distinct from currently marketed oral anti-diabetic drugs (“OAD”).
 TTP399
 TTP399 is an orally administered, small molecule, liver-selective glucokinase activator (“GKA”) in development as a new potential OAD for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. TTP399 has a novel mechanism of action: liver-selective activation of GK that seeks to provide intensive glycemic control and a reduction in the risk of hypoglycemia. Our trials for TTP399 to date suggest that our liver-selective approach to GK activation has the potential to avoid the tolerability issues associated with other GKAs, such as activation of GK in the pancreas, stimulation of insulin secretion independent of glucose, hypoglycemia, increased lipids and liver toxicity. Based on data from Phase 1 and 2 trials to date, we believe that TTP399, if approved, has the potential to be a first-in-class OAD due to its liver-selectivity and novel mechanism of action.  We have completed nine Phase 1 and two Phase 2 clinical trials of TTP399, one of which was six months in duration. In our Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, TTP399 was well tolerated with negligible incidence of hypoglycemia.
 Positive Phase 2 Simplici-T1 Study
 In February 2020, we announced positive results from the Simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP399, assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of TTP399 in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (“T1D”) over a 12 week period.  The study was designed to evaluate whether TTP399 is well tolerated and can improve daily glucose profiles and

HbA1c in people living with T1D when administered as an oral add-on to insulin therapy.  The Simplici-T1 Study achieved its primary objective by demonstrating statistically significant improvements in HbA1c for TTP399 compared to placebo.  
 TTP399 was well tolerated with similar incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events overall and by system organ class in both treatment groups.  The study had no report of diabetic ketoacidosis in either treatment group. There was no incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the treated group and one incident in the placebo group. Patients taking TTP399 experienced fewer symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes: two subjects taking TTP399 reported at least one event compared to eight subjects taking placebo.
 Clinical Development Plan
 In light of the positive results of our Simplici-T1 Study, we requested a Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss the trial design and other requirements for the next stage of development for TTP399. The Company received written responses from the FDA in June and September 2020.  Based upon the responses provided, the Company plans to conduct a placebo-controlled six-month clinical trial in approximately 400 subjects, followed by a second placebo-controlled six-month clinical trial to be initiated thereafter.  The Company would also include a six-month open label extension in the first clinical trial to provide patient data of the necessary duration to support the safety and efficacy of TTP399.  In its response, the FDA confirmed that the effect size of TTP399 on events of hypoglycemia as demonstrated in the Phase 2 SimpliciT-1 Study are clinically meaningful and that a reduction in events of hypoglycemia would be an acceptable clinical endpoint for evaluation of a therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
 Finally, the Company is conducting a phase 1 mechanistic study of TTP399 in patients with type 1 diabetes to determine the impact of TTP399 on ketone body formation during a period of acute insulin withdrawal. The Company proposed the mechanistic study to the FDA and the FDA recommended that the study be performed in support of the planned pivotal trials.  The results of this mechanistic study will provide additional evidence to support the effects of TTP399 on diabetic ketoacidosis (“DKA”) in patients with type 1 diabetes. We expect to report top-line results in the second or third quarter of 2021.
 Our Psoriasis Program – PDE4 Inhibitor
 Psoriasis Overview
 Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease in which the growth cycle of skin is accelerated due to an imbalance in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.   This results in the proliferation of skin cells and the development of raised, red, silvery scale plaques (i.e. plaque psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris) that has not only medical implications but an impact on a patient’s quality of life.  While the specific inciting events for this pro-inflammatory process are unknown psoriasis may be caused by autoimmunity and genetic predisposition.   Events such as trauma to the skin, stress, illness or infection that triggers the immune systems, obesity, and weather have been identified as triggers for flare ups.    
Current Treatment for Psoriasis and Their Limitations
 Topical therapies including glucocorticoids and vitamin D analogs are the mainstay of treatment for mild psoriasis.  The continuous long-term use of glucocorticoids is limited by the risk of skin thinning / atrophy and the potential for systemic absorption.    Vitamin D analogs are often added to glucocorticoids to improve glucocorticoid efficacy while allowing for reduction in glucocorticoid dose.  Moderate to severe disease is treated with systemic therapies including oral PDE4 inhibition, immunosuppressants, retinoids, and biologics (ex: anti-TNF agents, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors).   Biologics, while realizing high efficacy rates in treating psoriasis, are associated with administration by injection, high cost, need for laboratory monitoring and increased risk of infection.     
 Inhibitors of PDE4 act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (“cAMP”), which has a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects. PDE4 activity is increased in the skin of patients with psoriasis leading to up-regulation of immune modulatory, pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines including interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).   Treatments for psoriasis are aimed at reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine activity.    The therapeutic potential of oral PDE4 inhibitors has been limited by dose limiting AEs such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. 
 HPP737
 HPP737 is an orally administered, potent and selective, non-CNS penetrant PDE4 inhibitor that addresses inflammatory diseases and offers the potential for an improved tolerability profile and efficacy over commercially available PDE4 inhibitors. HPP737 has shown potent inhibition of IL-17a and TNF-α production in in vitro studies and activity in several animal models of inflammation. HPP737 has completed Phase 1 single-ascending dose and initial multiple-ascending dose studies, in which it was well tolerated at all doses tested in healthy volunteers.  Clinical data generated to date supports achieving target engagement (reduction in ex vivo LPS stimulated TNF-α) at HPP737 plasma concentrations predicted to be efficacious from preclinical models.

Clinical Development Plan
 We are conducting a subsequent multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study of HPP737, an orally administered phosphodiesterase type 4 (“PDE4”) inhibitor, to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of HPP737 in healthy volunteers as part of our psoriasis development program.  The goal of this study is to continue multiple-dose escalation to define a maximum tolerated dose characterized by minimal or no GI intolerance (i.e., nausea, vomiting or diarrhea). We expect to complete this study in the second quarter of 2021.
 Our Dementia Program – Azeliragon
 Phase 2 Elevage Study in Patients with Mild-AD and Type 2 Diabetes
 Based on a subgroup analysis from the previously conducted Phase 3 STEADFAST Study, we conducted a Phase 2 study to evaluate azeliragon as a potential treatment of mild-AD in patients with type 2 diabetes (the “Elevage Study”).  The Elevage Study did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating an improvement in cognition as assessed by the 14-item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog14) relative to placebo. 
Future Development of Azeliragon
 Upon the failure of the Elevage Study, we have discontinued the development of azeliragon for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.  However, we are evaluating the potential for its use in other indications.  We currently have an ongoing pre-clinical collaboration with the University of Queensland Australia and Yale University to evaluate the use of azeliragon for the prevention of type 1 diabetes in animal models.  We may also pursue other strategic opportunities for the further development of azeliragon, when and if they arise.
 Our Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Program – GLP-1r Agonist
 Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes Overview
 Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (“CFRD”) shares some features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes but is distinct, and is likewise categorized as diabetes due to other causes, specifically a disease of the exocrine pancreas by the American Diabetes Association. In people with cystic fibrosis (“CF”), the thick, sticky mucus that is characteristic of the disease causes scarring of the pancreas. This scarring prevents the pancreas from producing normal amounts of insulin. The damaged pancreas also responds to insulin signaling in a delayed manner. The delay and blunting of the insulin response in patients with CFRD results in post-prandial hyperglycemia.
The Role of GLP-1r Activation in Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes
 GLP-1, an incretin hormone that is released by the gut in response to nutrients, lowers postprandial glucose by promoting insulin secretion. Abnormally low postprandial stimulation of incretins has been described in CF patients and improvement in postprandial hyperglycemia has been demonstrated following prandial administration of GLP-1 agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors.  Nevertheless, the use of existing GLP-1 mimetics that are available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to treat CFRD is limited by the GI side effects and undesired weight loss associated with these agents.
 TTP273
 TTP273 is an orally available, small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been demonstrated to reduce postprandial glucose excursion in response to an oral glucose test or mixed meal tolerance test in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. We believe that TTP273 could be used to treat postprandial hyperglycemia in CFRD patients and CF patients with abnormal post-prandial glucose excursions without inducing hypoglycemia or GI side effects.  An oral therapy such as TTP273 is needed because the current method of treatment of CFRD is injected insulin, which comes with associated risks of hypoglycemia and poses additional burdens on patients. Other available oral therapies for type 2 diabetes are not recommended for the treatment of CFRD due to side effects such as hypoglycemia, weight loss, or nausea.  In particular, the GLP-1 mimetics currently in the market have been demonstrated to result in increased GI side effects and undesired weight loss, both of which are major drawbacks for patients with CFRD.  
 We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP273. Additionally, we have completed nine Phase 1 clinical trials and one Phase 2 clinical trial of TTP054, a predecessor orally administered GLP-1r agonist. In our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, TTP273 has been demonstrated to be well-tolerated with lower incidences of GI side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, than placebo with minimal weight loss, especially in non-obese patients.
 We are currently planning an adaptive Phase 1b/2 clinical trial assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of TTP273, but the final design may be adjusted based on the feedback received, if any, from the FDA and are seeking a funding partner to enable the conduct of this clinical trial.

Our Nrf2/Bach1 Modulator Program
 The Role of Nrf2/Bach1 Modulators
 Chronic, unresolved inflammation, oxidative stress, and resulting fibrosis are key features of many diseases.  Inflammation is an integral component of the normal immune response that occurs when cells encounter harmful stimuli, such as invading pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. During inflammation, cells activate inflammatory processes and complexes that increase the production of cytokines, which are proteins that recruit and activate immune cells.
 Inflammation and mitochondrial metabolism are closely associated. The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of the cell as they produce the energy that the cell needs to function. This energy is produced by converting fatty acids and glucose into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a process called oxidative phosphorylation. During inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism is temporarily reprogrammed to suppress oxidative phosphorylation.  Instead of primarily making ATP, the mitochondria divert fatty acids and glucose to increase the production of proinflammatory mediators.  During this reprogramming, the mitochondria release chemically-reactive molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can directly attack pathogens and amplify the production of cytokines.
 In a normal immune response, the resolution of inflammation begins after the harmful stimuli have been eliminated.  Nrf2 is a protein that plays a key role in the resolution of inflammation by regulating the expression of specific genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, redox balance, and cytokine production.  When activated, Nrf2 promotes the resolution of inflammation by normalizing mitochondrial metabolism, restoring redox balance, and suppressing cytokine production.  
 In many chronic and genetic diseases, Nrf2 activity is suppressed, and the resolution of inflammation fails to occur or is inadequate, leading to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, excess production of ROS, and production of cytokines. These processes cause chronic inflammation, which can ultimately lead to tissue damage and loss of organ function.
 To date, therapeutic agents seeking to active Nrf2, such as such as Bardoxolone or Tecfidera, have relied on reactive, electrophilic biological targets that may present safety and tolerability issues. Non-electrophilic activation of the Nrf2 pathway via targeting the Bach1 transcriptional repressor provides an alternative mechanism by which to increase the activation of Nrf2 to reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation associated with many acute and chronic diseases.
 Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor that controls the expression of certain genes involved in the body’s antioxidant response processes. Genetic knock-out models of Bach1 have shown increased expression of multiple antioxidant proteins such as heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), leading to a significant level of cellular, tissue and organ protection in a wide variety of mouse models. Hemin and the hemin mimetic cobalt protoporphyrin IX (“CoPP”) are Bach1 ligands that have served as useful tool compounds to investigate the role of Bach1 inhibition in a variety of disease settings. Both molecules have been shown to have beneficial effects on oxidative stress and inflammatory-mediated pathologies in a number of animal models. Further, the ubiquity of the response suggests that the observed tissue protective effects are not related to the underlying causes of a particular disease, but instead are an intrinsic outcome of Bach1 modulation along with Nrf2 activation.
 HPP3033
 Our candidate, HPP3033, represents a novel, non-electrophilic therapeutic approach to activating the Nrf2 pathway that has the potential to be used in the treatment of chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress. We are currently evaluating HPP3033 and other Nrf2 activator compounds in various preclinical studies.

 In August 2017, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement with JDRF International (“JDRF”) (the “JDRF Agreement”) to support the funding of the Simplici-T1 Study, an adaptive Phase 1b/2 study to explore the effects of TTP399 in type 1 diabetes.  In February 2020, we reported positive results from the Phase 2 confirming portion of the Simplici-T1 Study. See “Our Type 1 Diabetes Program –TTP399 – Positive Phase 2 Simplici-T1 Study” above for further details.  According to the terms of the JDRF Agreement, JDRF provided research funding of $3.0 million based on the achievement of research and development milestones, with the total funding provided by JDRF not to exceed approximately one-half of the total cost of the project.  Additionally, we have the obligation to make certain milestone payments to JDRF upon the commercialization, licensing, sale or transfer of TTP399 as a treatment for type 1 diabetes.
 Novo Nordisk
 In February 2007, we entered into an Agreement Concerning Glucokinase Activator Project with Novo Nordisk A/S (the “Novo License Agreement”) whereby we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain Novo Nordisk intellectual property rights to discover, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use and commercialize products for the prevention, treatment, control, mitigation or palliation of human or animal diseases or conditions. As part of this license grant, we obtained certain worldwide rights to Novo Nordisk’s GKA program, including rights to preclinical and clinical compounds such as TTP399. This agreement was amended in May 2019 to create milestone payments applicable to certain specific and non-specific areas of therapeutic use. Under the terms of the Novo License Agreement, the Company has additional potential developmental and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $9.0 million for approval of a product for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, $50.5 million for approval of a product for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, or $115.0 million for approval of a product in any other indication. The Company may also be obligated to pay an additional $75.0 million in potential sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments, at mid-single digit royalty rates, based on tiered sales of commercialized licensed products.
 Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture clinical supplies of our drug candidates and for our other research and discovery programs.  We do not have multiple sources of supply for the components used in our drug candidates.

 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by employees or through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become publicly known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use or incorporate intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our drug candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, mechanism of action, control and predictability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement, and availability of comparable alternative therapies.

Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.  Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement.
 Potential Competing Products – Type 1 Diabetes
 If approved, we expect that our type 1 diabetes investigational drug candidate will compete with other oral non-insulin agents that are currently being developed or which have limited approval in certain jurisdictions.  These include SGLT-1/2 inhibitors, such as sotagliflozin, being developed by Lexicon and SGLT-2 inhibitors such as AstraZeneca’s dapagliflozin, both of which are approved for limited use in the European Union and Japan as well as Eli Lilly/Boehringer Ingelheim’s empagliflozin, which is not currently approved for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.  None of these treatments are approved for use in type 1 diabetes in the United States.
Potential Competing Products – Psoriasis
 If approved, we expect that our psoriasis candidate will compete with Otezla (apremilast), the only PDE4 inhibitor currently approved to treat psoriasis and marketed by Amgen Inc., topical PDE4 inhibitor drug candidates currently in development, if approved, including roflumilast being developed by Arcutis Biotherapeutics, anti-TNF biologics approved to treat psoriasis, including Enbrel (etanercept), Remicade (infliximab), and Humira (adalimumab), and anti-TNF biosimilars currently in development.  
 We believe that our investigational drug candidates may offer key potential advantages over these competitive products that could enable our drug candidates, if approved, to capture meaningful market share from our competitors.
 Collaboration Revenue and Customers
 The majority of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is related to our licenses of certain compounds in the pre-clinical stage or clinical stage, including the Anteris License Agreement, Huadong License Agreement, the Reneo License Agreement and the Newsoara License Agreement.  Revenue recognized in these periods relates to initial consideration received in the form of upfront payments and equity interests, research activities performed by our personnel, and the achievement of development milestones.  
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union (“EU”), extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. For a full discussion of the regulatory framework for the approval and regulation of investigational drug candidates, and applicable domestic and foreign healthcare law, please see “Part 1 – Item 1 – Business - Government Regulation and Product Approvals” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 25 employees, of which at least 13 hold graduate degrees (including 9 doctorate degrees) and 13 are engaged in full-time research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.  We continually evaluate our business needs and opportunities and balance in house expertise and capacity with external expertise and capacity. Currently, we rely on third-party contract research organizations and contract manufacturers for the conduct of our studies.
