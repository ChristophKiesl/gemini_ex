Description of Our Assets 
We conduct our operations and own our operating assets through Crestwood Midstream and its subsidiaries and our joint ventures. Our financial statements reflect three operating and reporting segments as of December 31, 2021: (i) gathering and processing north (includes our Williston and Powder River Basin operations); (ii) gathering and processing south (includes our Marcellus and Barnett operations as well as our Crestwood Permian Basin Holdings LLC equity method investment in the Delaware Basin); and (iii) storage and logistics (includes our crude oil, NGL and natural gas storage and logistics operations, and our Tres Palacios Holdings LLC and Powder River Basin Industrial Complex, LLC equity method investments). Our gathering and processing north and gathering and processing south segments were historically combined into one segment, and 
our storage and logistics segment was historically separated into a storage and transportation segment and a marketing, supply and logistics segment. 
Gathering and Processing North Segment
Our gathering and processing north operations provide natural gas, crude oil and produced water gathering, compression, treating, processing and disposal services to producers in the Williston Basin and Powder River Basin. Our gathering and processing north segment’s operating assets consist of: (i) natural gas facilities with approximately 0.4 Bcf/d of gathering capacity and approximately 0.5 Bcf/d of processing capacity; (ii) crude oil facilities with approximately 150,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity and 266,000 Bbls of storage capacity; and (iii) produced water facilities with approximately 130,000 Bbls/d of gathering and disposal capacity.
Williston Basin
We own and operate an integrated crude oil, rich natural gas and produced water gathering system, with a gas processing facility (Bear Den) and produced water disposal facilities, collectively the Arrow system, in the core of the Bakken Shale in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota, primarily located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The COLT Hub, a crude-by-rail facility located approximately 60 miles northwest of the Arrow system, connects to the Arrow system through the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline Company LLC’s, a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (Marathon), crude oil pipeline system allowing access to the Pacific Northwest markets. Crude oil gathered on the Arrow system can service Midwest refineries from Patoka, Illinois and the Gulf Coast via the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) or the Guernsey, Wyoming markets through the Kinder Morgan Inc. (Kinder Morgan) Double H Pipeline and the True Pipeline system. In addition to the multiple pipeline take-away outlets, the Arrow system has 266,000 Bbls of crude oil working storage capacity. The Bear Den facility and associated pipelines at the Arrow system fulfill nearly all of the processing requirements for producers on the Arrow system. Our operations are anchored by long-term gathering contracts that largely provide for fixed-fee gathering services with annual escalators for crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services. 
Powder River Basin
We own and operate the Jackalope rich natural gas gathering system and Bucking Horse gas processing facility in Converse County, Wyoming, which connects to 157 well pads and is supported by a long-term gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake) that has a remaining contract term of 15 years and provides minimum revenue guarantees for three years.

(1)Fixed-fee contracts represent contracts in which our customers agree to pay a flat rate based on the amount of gas delivered. Mixed contracts include percentage-of-proceeds and fixed-fee arrangements.
Our gathering and processing south segment provides gathering, processing, compression, disposal and transportation services under a variety of contracts. Although the cash flows from these operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with remaining terms ranging from 1-16 years, the results of our operations are significantly influenced by the volumes gathered and processed through our systems. The cash flows from these operations can also be impacted in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality, weather fluctuations and the financial condition of our customers. Our election to enter primarily into fixed-fee contracts subject to acreage dedications helps minimize our long-term exposure to commodity prices and provides us more stable operating performance and cash flows.
Storage and Logistics Segment
Our storage and logistics operations provide NGL, crude oil and natural gas storage, terminal, marketing and transportation (including rail, truck and pipeline) services to producers, refiners, marketers, utilities and other customers.
Below is a description of our storage and logistics operating assets, including those of our equity method investments.

We provide hauling services to customers primarily in the Central Mid-Continent and East Coast of the United States.
•COLT Hub. The COLT Hub consists of our integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal located in the heart of the Williston Basin in Williams County, North Dakota. The COLT Hub has approximately 1.2 MMBbls of crude oil storage capacity and 160,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity. Customers can source crude oil for rail loading through interconnected gathering systems, a twelve-bay truck unloading rack and the COLT Connector, a 21-mile 10-inch bi-directional proprietary pipeline that connects the COLT terminal to our storage tank at Dry Fork (Beaver Lodge/Ramberg junction). The COLT Hub is connected to the Meadowlark Midstream Company, LLC and Kinder Morgan Hiland crude oil pipelines and the DAPL interstate pipeline system at the COLT terminal, and the Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. and Marathon interstate pipeline systems at Dry Fork. The pipelines and truck unloading racks connected to the COLT Hub can deliver up to approximately 290,000 Bbls/d of crude oil to our terminal.
•Powder River Basin Crude Oil Facilities. We own a 50.01% equity interest in Powder River Basin Industrial Complex, LLC (PRBIC), a joint venture between Crestwood Crude Logistics LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary and Twin Eagle Resources Management LLC (Twin Eagle). PRBIC owns an integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal located in Douglas County, Wyoming. PRBIC, which is operated by Twin Eagle, sources crude oil production from Powder River Basin producers through an eight-bay truck unloading rack. The PRBIC facility includes 20,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity and 380,000 Bbls of crude oil working storage capacity. The pipeline terminal includes connections to Kinder Morgan’s Double H Pipeline system and Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.’s (Plains) Rocky Mountain Pipeline system.
•Natural Gas Storage Facility. We own a 50.01% equity interest in Tres Palacios Holdings LLC (Tres Holdings), a joint venture between CMLP Tres Manager LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Brookfield Infrastructure Group which owns the remaining 49.99% equity interest in Tres Holdings. Tres Palacios Gas Storage LLC (Tres Palacios), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tres Holdings, owns a FERC-certificated 34.9 Bcf multi-cycle salt dome natural gas storage facility located in Markham, Texas, with a FERC-certificated maximum injection rate of 1,000 MMcf/d and a maximum withdrawal rate of 2,500 MMcf/d. The Tres Palacios natural gas storage facility’s 63-mile, 24-inch diameter header system (including a 38-mile dual 24-inch diameter system, a 20-mile north pipeline lateral and an approximate 5-mile south pipeline lateral) interconnects with 12 pipeline systems and can receive residue gas from the tailgate of Kinder Morgan’s Houston central processing plant.
The table below summarizes certain contract information about our COLT Hub operations and our Tres Holdings equity investment as of December 31, 2021:

Facility | Type of Contracts(1) | Weighted Average Remaining Contract Terms | Major Customers 
COLT | Fixed-Fee, Firm | Less than 1 year | BP Products North America, Inc. (BP), Flint Hills Resources
Tres Palacios | Firm(2) | 2 years | Trafigura Trading LLC, Hartree Partners LP, BP 

(1)Fixed-fee contracts represent contracts in which our customers agree to pay a flat rate based on the amount of crude oil transported or stored. Firm contracts represent contracts whereby our customers agree to pay for a specified amount of storage or transportation capacity, whether or not the capacity is utilized.
(2)Tres Palacios has approximately 28.8 Bcf of firm storage contracts at December 31, 2021.
The cash flows from our COLT Hub operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with terms ranging from six months to 1 year. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are supported by contracts with refiners and marketers. The rates and durations of the contracts associated with our crude oil terminals have eroded as pipelines have come on-line that make crude-by-rail options less economical, which impacts our cash flows from operations. The cash flows from our Tres Palacios joint venture are predominantly fee-based under contracts with remaining terms ranging from 1 to 6 years. Cash flows from interruptible and other hub services provided by our Tres Palacios joint venture tend to increase during the peak winter season. The cash flows from our other storage and logistics operations represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods.
Major Customers 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019, BP and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total consolidated revenues. 
Competition 
Our gathering and processing operations compete for customers based on reputation, operating reliability and flexibility, price, creditworthiness, and service offerings, including interconnectivity to producer-desired takeaway options (i.e., processing facilities and pipelines). We face strong competition in acquiring new supplies in the production basins in which we operate, and competition customarily is impacted by the level of drilling activity in a particular geographic region and fluctuations in commodity prices. Our primary competitors include other midstream companies with gathering and processing operations and producer-owned systems, and certain competitors enjoy first-mover advantages over us and may offer producers greater gathering and processing efficiencies, lower operating costs and more flexible commercial terms. 
Natural gas storage and pipeline operators compete for customers primarily based on geographic location, which determines connectivity and proximity to supply sources and end-users, as well as price, operating reliability and flexibility, available capacity and service offerings. Our primary competitors in our natural gas storage market include other independent storage providers and major natural gas pipelines with storage capabilities embedded within their transmission systems. Our primary competitors in the natural gas transportation market include major natural gas pipelines and intrastate pipelines that can transport natural gas volumes between interstate systems. Long-haul pipelines often enjoy cost advantages over new pipeline projects with respect to options for delivering greater volumes to existing demand centers, and new projects and expansions proposed from time to time may serve the markets we serve and effectively displace the service we provide to customers. 
Our crude oil rail terminals primarily compete with crude oil pipelines and other midstream companies that own and operate rail terminals in the markets we serve. The crude oil logistics business is characterized by strong competition for supplies, and competition is based largely on customer service quality, pricing, and geographic proximity to customers and other market hubs. 
Our NGL marketing and logistics business competes primarily with integrated major oil companies, refiners and processors, and other energy companies that own or control transportation and storage assets that can be optimized for supply, marketing and logistics services. 
Regulation
Our operations and investments are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, impacts our profitability. In general, midstream companies have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years.
Pipeline and Underground Storage Safety 
We are subject to pipeline safety regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and storage facilities. All of our natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and all of our NGL and crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA). 
These federal statutes and PHMSA regulations collectively impose numerous safety requirements on pipeline operators, such as the development of a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and the implementation of pipeline integrity management programs. For example, pursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (HCAs) and moderate consequence areas (MCAs) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. The HCAs for natural gas pipelines are predicated on high-population areas (which, for natural gas transmission lines, include Class 3 and 4 areas and, depending on the potential impacts of a risk event, may include Class 1 and 2 areas) whereas HCAs along crude oil and NGL pipelines are based on high-population density areas, in addition to certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. A MCA is attributable to natural gas pipelines and is based on high-population areas as well as certain principal, high-capacity roadways, though it does not meet the definition of a natural gas pipeline HCA. Integrity management programs require more frequent inspections and other preventative measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs and MCAs. 
We plan to continue testing under our pipeline integrity management programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines in accordance with PHMSA regulations. Notwithstanding our preventive and investigatory maintenance efforts, we may incur significant expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or due to the implementation of more stringent pipeline safety standards resulting from new or amended legislation. 
Legislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Pipeline Safety Act), the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Pipeline Safety Act) and, most recently, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (2020 Pipeline Safety Act). Each of these laws imposed increased pipeline safety obligations on pipeline operators. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, required PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2020 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory initiatives, including obligating operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations.
With the adoption of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act and the 2020 Pipeline Safety Act, there exist mandates for PHMSA to make pipeline safety requirements more stringent, which further impose added pipeline safety requirements on operators.
•Natural Gas Storage Facilities. In February 2020, PHMSA published a final rule that amended the minimum safety issues applicable to natural gas storage facilities, including wells, wellbore tubing and casing. The February 2020 rule was further amended in July 2020 to include certain applicable reporting requirements that had been deleted when the February 2020 rule was published. 
•Natural Gas Rulemaking. In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rule for certain natural gas pipelines that imposes numerous requirements, including maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) reconfirmation and exceedance reporting, the integrity assessment of additional pipeline mileage found in MCAs and Class 3 and Class 4 non-HCAs by 2039 unless the pipeline cannot be modified to permit such accommodation, and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. 
•Hazardous Liquids Rulemaking. In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rule that significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, including, for example, performance of periodic assessments and expanded use of leak detection systems, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to an HCA. Additionally, this final rule requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting an HCA to be capable of accommodating in line inspection tools by 2039 unless the pipeline cannot be modified to permit such accommodation. Moreover, this final rule extends annual, accident, and safety-related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure.
•Natural Gas Gathering Lines Rulemaking. In November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that will impose safety regulations on approximately 400,000 miles of previously unregulated onshore gas gathering lines that, among other things, will impose criteria for inspection and repair of fugitive emissions, extend reporting requirements to all gas gathering operators and apply a set of minimum safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures.
Separately, in June 2021, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin advising pipeline and pipeline facility operators of applicable requirements to update their inspection and maintenance plans for the elimination of hazardous leaks and minimization of natural gas released from pipeline facilities. PHMSA, together with state regulators, is expected to commence inspection of these plans in 2022. We are evaluating the operational and financial impact related to one or more of these laws and PHMSA rules. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, and the 2020 Pipeline Safety Act, as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate pipelines, but most states are certified by the Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate pipelines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. Our pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements, and we do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. 
Natural Gas Gathering 
Natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from FERC jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline, and not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation. The FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided are not exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, the services provided by such facility would be subject to FERC regulation. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, requirements prohibiting undue discrimination, and complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. These 
statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer, or one source of supply over another source of supply, and generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.
The states in which we operate gathering systems have adopted a form of complaint-based regulation, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. To date, these regulations have not had an adverse effect on our systems. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future, however, a failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.
In Texas, we have filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) to establish rates and terms of service for certain of our pipelines. Our assets in Texas include intrastate common carrier NGL pipelines subject to the regulation of the TRRC, which requires that our NGL pipelines file tariff publications containing all the rules and the regulations governing the rates and charges for services we perform. NGL pipeline rates may be limited to provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services.
NGL Storage 
Our NGL storage terminals are subject to federal, state and local regulation. For example, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (INDNR), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA have jurisdiction over the underground storage of NGLs and NGL related well drilling, well conversions and well plugging in Indiana, New York and Michigan, respectively. The INDNR regulates aspects of our Seymour facility, the NYSDEC and EPA regulate aspects of the Bath facility and the EGLE and EPA regulate aspects of our Alto facility. Additionally, NGL terminals have the potential to be subject to state and federal air compliance regulations. For example, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the EPA have jurisdiction over facilities with the potential to emit regulated air pollutants in Pennsylvania. The PADEP regulates those aspects of the Schaefferstown facility. 
Crude Oil Transportation
The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an interstate basis is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. The ICA and FERC regulations also require that such rates be just and reasonable, and to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner so as to not confer undue preference upon any shipper. The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an intrastate basis is subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate crude oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Intrastate common carriers must also offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. Our crude oil pipelines in North Dakota are not common carrier pipelines and, therefore, are not subject to rate regulation by the FERC or any state regulatory commission. We cannot, however, provide assurance that the FERC will not, at some point, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of our crude oil pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or are otherwise not exempt from the FERC’s filing or reporting requirements, or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations. In the event the FERC were to determine that our crude oil pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or otherwise would not qualify for a waiver from the FERC’s applicable regulatory requirements, we would likely be required to (i) file a tariff with the FERC; (ii) provide a cost justification for the transportation charge; (iii) provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination; and (iv) potentially be subject to fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
Certain of our crude oil operations located in North Dakota are subject to state regulation by the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). For example, gas conditioning requirements established by the NDIC recently will require operators of crude by rail terminals to report to the NDIC any crude volumes received for loading that exceed federal vapor pressure limits. State legislation has been proposed that, if passed, would authorize and require the NDIC to promulgate regulations under which produced water pipelines would be required to, among other things, install leak detection facilities and post bonds to cover potential remediation costs associated with releases. Moreover, the regulation of our customers’ production activities by the NDIC impacts our operations. For example, the NDIC approved additional requirements relating to site construction, underground gathering pipelines, spill containment, bonding for underground gathering pipelines and construction of berms 
around facilities. Additionally, the NDIC issued an order wherein the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” requiring our customers to capture certain percentages of natural gas produced by specified dates (the Gas Capture Order). The Gas Capture Order was subsequently modified in 2018. Exploration and production operators in the state may be required to install new equipment to satisfy these goals, and any failure by operators to meet these gas capture percentage goals would subject those operators to production restrictions, which could reduce the amount of commodities we gather on the Arrow system from our customers, and have a corresponding adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Portions of our Arrow gathering system, which is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, may be subject to applicable regulation by the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations may apply to operators and other parties within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American lands. These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, tribal employment preferences and numerous other matters.
Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the BLM. However, Native American tribes possess certain inherent authorities to enact and enforce their own internal laws and regulations as long as such laws and regulations do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes. These tribal laws and regulations may include various fees, taxes and requirements to extend preference in employment to tribal members or Indian owned businesses. Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation may be subject to the pertinent Native American judiciary system, or barred from litigating matters adverse to the pertinent tribe unless there is a specific waiver of the tribe’s sovereign immunity. Therefore, we may be subject to various applicable laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations. One or more of these applicable regulatory requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits necessary to operate on tribal lands, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project within a Native American reservation. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights-of-way or obtain new rights-of-way in Native American lands without experiencing significant costs. For example, following a decision by the Federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals that relied, in part, on a previous Federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Native American landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline’s rights-of-way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators.
In recent years, PHMSA and other federal agencies have reviewed the adequacy of transporting Bakken crude oil by rail transport and, as necessary, have pursued rules to better assure the safe transport of Bakken crude oil by rail. For example, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, providing new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of Bakken crude oil transported. Additionally in 2016, PHMSA published a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029 and, more recently in February 2019, PHMSA published a final rule requiring railroads to develop and submit comprehensive oil spill response plans for specific route segments traveled by a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train. Additionally, that February 2019 final rule requires railroads to establish geographic response zones along various rail routes, ensure that both personnel and equipment are staged and prepared to respond in the event of an accident and share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions. We, as the owner of a Bakken crude loading terminal, may be adversely affected to the extent more stringent rail transport rules result in more significant operating costs in the shipment of Bakken crude oil by rail or as a result of delays or limitations of such shipments. 
Natural Gas Storage and Transportation 
Our equity investments’ natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation under NGPSA. On December 14, 2016, PHMSA issued final interim rules that impose new safety related requirements on downhole facilities (including wells, wellbore tubing and casing) of new and existing underground natural gas storage facilities. The final interim rules adopt and make mandatory two American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices that, among other things, address construction, maintenance, risk-management and integrity-management procedures. PHMSA indicated when it issued the interim final rule that the adoption of these safety standards for natural gas storage facilities represents a first step in a 
multi-phase process to enhance the safety of underground natural gas storage, with more standards likely forthcoming. However, in June 2017, PHMSA temporarily suspended specific enforcement actions pertaining to provisions that had previously been non-mandatory provisions prior to incorporation into the December 2016 interim final rule, as PHMSA announced it would reconsider the interim final rule. PHMSA re-opened the rule to public comment in October 2017. The Unified Agenda issued by the federal government published a July 2019 date for issuance of a final rule in replacement of this interim final rule but no final rule has yet been issued. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of any future regulatory actions in this area. To the extent we operate or manage natural gas storage facilities owned by our equity investments, we have evaluated the final interim rules and do not anticipate any significant impact on our equity investments or any significant increase in the costs of operating and maintaining natural gas storage facilities. 
The natural gas storage operations of our Tres Holdings equity investment is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act. Under the Natural Gas Act, the FERC has authority to regulate natural gas transportation services in interstate commerce, which includes natural gas storage services. The FERC exercises jurisdiction over (i) rates charged for services and the terms and conditions of service; (ii) the certification and construction of new facilities; (iii) the extension or abandonment of services and facilities; (iv) the maintenance of accounts and records; (v) the acquisition and disposition of facilities; (vi) standards of conduct between affiliated entities; and (vii) various other matters. Regulated natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates determined by the FERC to be unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory, and both the existing tariff rates and the proposed rates of regulated natural gas companies are subject to challenge.
The rates and terms and conditions of our natural gas storage equity investment are found in the FERC-approved tariff of Tres Palacios, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tres Holdings that owns the Tres Palacios natural gas storage facility. Tres Palacios is authorized to charge and collect market-based rates for storage services. Market-based authority allows our equity investment to negotiate rates with individual customers based on market demand. A loss of market-based authority or any successful complaint or protest against the rates charged or provided by our equity investment could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act to (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC rules, regulations and orders, up to approximately $1.3 million per day, per violation.
 NGLs Transportation
The transportation of NGLs by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations, which are administered by the United States Department of Transportation, cover the transportation of hazardous materials. 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
Our operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge and emission of pollutants into the environment, environmental protection or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on our operations, including (i) the need to obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; (iii) apply workplace health and safety standards for the benefit of employees; (iv) require remedial activities or corrective actions to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and (v) impose substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the (i) assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; (ii) imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; (iii) occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting or the development of projects; and (iv) issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the activities in a particular area. 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing federal environmental laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which our business operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject:
•The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes strict liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes;
•The Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, monitoring and reporting requirements and that serves as a legal basis for the EPA to adopt climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
•The Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
•The Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of substances into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources; 
•The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment and which may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments or detailed Environmental Impact Statements to be made available for public review and comment;
•The Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered or threatened species, or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban in affected areas; and
•The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances and appropriate control measures.
Certain of these federal environmental laws, as well as their state counterparts, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore properties where pollutants have been released regardless of whom may have caused the harm or whether the activity was performed in compliance with all applicable laws. States also adopt and implement their own environmental laws and regulations, which may be more stringent than federal requirements. In the course of our operations, generated materials or wastes may have been spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials or wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of the properties owned or leased by us were previously operated by third parties whose management, disposal or release of materials and wastes was not under our control. Accordingly, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up or remediating contamination arising out of our operations or as a result of activities by others who previously occupied or operated on properties now owned or leased by us. Private parties, including the owners of properties that we lease and facilities where our materials or wastes are taken for recycling or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. We may not be able to recover some or any of these additional costs from insurance.
During 2014, we experienced three releases on our Arrow produced water gathering system that resulted in approximately 28,000 barrels of produced water being released on lands within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. In May 2015, we experienced another release of approximately 5,200 barrels of produced water, and during September 2019, we experienced two produced water releases totaling approximately 5,000 barrels. We are substantially complete with all remediation efforts related to these spills, have settled and paid all potential fines and penalties related to these water spills. 
It is also possible that adoption of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent interpretation of existing environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general or otherwise adversely affect demand for our services. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone and, in December 2020, published notice of a final action to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, several groups have filed 
litigation over this December 2020 decision and the Biden Administration has announced plans to reconsider the December 2020 final action in favor of a more stringent ground-level ozone NAAQS. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers' equipment, resulting in longer permitting timelines, and could significantly increase our or our customers' capital expenditures and operating costs. In another example, there continues to be uncertainty on the federal government’s applicable jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands and the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations have pursued multiple rulemakings since 2015 in an attempt to determine the scope of such reach. While the EPA and Corps under the Trump Administration issued a final rule in April 2020 narrowing federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 to further review and assess these regulations consistent with the new administration’s policy objectives, following which the EPA and Corps announced plans in June 2021 to initiate a new rulemaking process that would repeal the 2020 rule and restore protections that were in place prior to 2015. Although the EPA and Corps did not seek to vacate the 2020 rule on an interim basis, two federal district courts in Arizona and New Mexico have vacated the 2020 rule in decisions announced during the third quarter of 2021. While these district court decisions may be appealed, it is clear that the EPA and Corps intend to adopt a more expansive definition for waters of the United States. As an initial step, the agencies published on December 7, 2021 a proposed rulemaking that would put back into place the pre-2015 definition of “waters of the United States” in effect prior to the 2015 rule issued under the Obama Administration and update it to reflect consideration of Supreme Court decisions. The proposed rule, if adopted would serve as an interim approach to “waters of the United States” and provide the agency with time to develop a subsequent rule that builds upon the currently proposed rule based, in part, on additional stakeholder involvement. To the extent that the EPA and the Corps under the Biden Administration issues a final rule that expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, such developments could delay, restrict or halt permitting or development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our customers’ operations, which may reduce the rate of production from operators.
In addition to the laws and regulations described above, the potential impact of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in other countries and, as a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, including certain oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, and impose new standards reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. Compliance with these rules or other initiatives could result in increased compliance costs on our operations. In November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would make methane emissions from the crude oil and natural gas sources category more stringent, by establishing Quad Ob new source and Quad Oc first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022 that will contain additional requirements not included in the November 2021 proposed rule and the agency anticipates issuing a final rule by the end of 2022. 
Additionally, various states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations has sponsored the Paris Agreement, which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, the international community gathered in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), during which multiple announcements (not having the effect of law) were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 countries joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States’ commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.
Additionally, our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies such as ours but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in 
the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices that favor “clean” power sources, such as wind and solar, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions may be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. While we cannot predict what policies may result from these announcements, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could impact our business and operations. Furthermore, the SEC has announced that it will propose rules that, amongst other matters, will establish a framework for the reporting of climate risks. However, no such rules have been proposed to date and we cannot predict what any such rules may require. To the extent the rules impose additional reporting obligations, we could face increased costs. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege an issuer’s existing climate disclosures are misleading or deficient. 
Finally, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. These climatic developments have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets and thus could have an adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy, thus potentially impacting the demand for our services. While our consideration of changing climatic conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design is intended to reduce the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of our facilities and our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality.
Increasing attention to climate change, societal expectations for companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and customer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our services, reduced profits, increased risks of governmental investigations and private party litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts from oil and natural gas products and bias against companies operating in the sector. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 
Organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance, climate change, health and safety and other ESG related factors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with fossil fuel energy-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or our customers and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our unit price and/or our access to and costs of capital.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 645 full-time employees, 254 of which were general and administrative employees and 391 of which were operational employees. Our ability to attract, develop, retain and keep our employees safe is critical to the operational performance and future sustainability of our company. 
We believe our ability to attract employees is significantly influenced by our efforts to create a culture founded on respect and collaboration, and our ability to value the diverse backgrounds, skills and contributions that our employees offer. Our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) is advanced by our Chief Diversity Officer and our internal D&I committee pursuant to a long-term D&I five-point plan with the key pillars of attracting talent for a diverse workforce, creating an inclusive and engaged workforce, focusing on sustainability and accountability, creating meaningful D&I-related partnerships, and building the future pipeline of employees with D&I in mind. During 2021, we demonstrated our commitment to D&I by conducting our first ever trainings on unconscious bias in the workplace and indigenous cultural awareness, hosting an 
internship program where over half of the participants came from diverse backgrounds, and focusing our community involvement and giving on D&I, such that over 40% of our volunteer hours and donations involved D&I organizations in the areas in which we work. Each of these D&I accomplishments were factored into our employees’ short-term incentive compensation for 2021, and we were able to exceed the targeted goals for each of those areas during 2021. 
We develop our employees through a comprehensive performance management program and through continuous training, especially as it relates to safety, operations, technology, human resources and ethics. 99.9% of our employees completed their assigned training in these areas during the year ended December 31, 2021.
We monitor our ability to retain our employees through our voluntary turnover rate (the percentage of employees who voluntarily leave our organization compared to our total employee population), which was 11% during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 8% during the year ended December 31, 2020 and was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the labor markets.
We monitor our ability to keep our employees safe by setting company-wide goals each year as it relates to leading indicators (i.e., near miss reporting) and lagging indicators (i.e., incident and injury rates), certain of which are factored into our employees’ short-term incentive compensation each year. During 2021, we exceeded all of our core safety goals and targets, and achieved a total recordable incident rate of 1.10, a days away restricted transferred rate of 0.66 and a preventable vehicular incident rate of 0.66 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
