Our Company & History 
 References to the Company, we, us, our and Dave & Busters in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Report) are references to Dave & Busters Entertainment, Inc. (D&B Entertainment) and its subsidiaries. D&B Entertainment was initially owned by Oak Hill Capital Partners III, L.P. and Oak Hill Capital Management Partners III, L.P. (collectively, the Oak Hill Funds). In October 2014, we completed our initial public offering (IPO). As of January 29, 2017, the Oak Hill Funds no longer owned any of our outstanding stock. 
 The Company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a leading owner and operator of high-volume entertainment and dining venues (stores) under the name Dave & Busters. The core of our concept is to offer our customers the opportunity to Eat Drink Play and Watch all in one location. Eat and Drink is offered through a full menu of Fun American New Gourmet entrées and appetizers and a full selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Our Play and Watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports and other televised events. Our customer mix skews moderately to males, primarily between the ages of 21 and 39, and we believe we also serve as an attractive venue for families with children and teenagers. We believe we appeal to a diverse customer base by providing a highly customizable experience in a dynamic and fun setting. 
 We operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53 week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, which ended on January 29, 2017, January 31, 2016, February 1, 2015, February 2, 2014, and February 3, 2013, respectively, each contained 52 weeks except fiscal 2012, which contained 53 weeks. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except share and per share amounts. 
 We opened our first store in Dallas, Texas in 1982 and since then we have expanded our portfolio nationally to 92 stores located in 33 states and one Canadian province as of January 29, 2017. We opened eleven new stores during fiscal 2016 and anticipate opening eleven to twelve additional stores in fiscal 2017. 
 Eat Drink Play and Watch - All Under One Roof 
 When our founders opened our first location, they sought to create a brand with a fun, upbeat atmosphere providing interactive entertainment options for adults and families, while serving high-quality food and beverages. Since then we have followed the same principle for each new store and in doing so we believe we have developed a distinctive brand based on our customer value proposition: Eat Drink Play and Watch. The interaction between playing games, watching sports, dining and enjoying our full-service bar areas is the defining feature of the Dave & Busters customer experience, and the layout of each store is designed to promote crossover between these activities. We believe this combination creates an experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. Our locations are also designed to accommodate private parties, business functions and other corporate-sponsored events. 
Eat 
 We seek to distinguish our food menu from other casual dining concepts with our strategy of offering Fun American New Gourmet entrées and appetizers. Our Fun American New Gourmet menu is intended to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers and includes classic American offerings with a fun twist. We believe we offer high-quality meals, including gourmet pastas, choice-grade steaks, premium sandwiches, decadent desserts and health-conscious entrée options that compare favorably to those of other higher-end casual dining operators. We believe our broad menu offers something for everyone and captures full meal, snacking and sports-viewing

 occasions. We plan to introduce new menu items three times per year that we believe reinforce the fun of the Dave & Busters brand. Our food revenues, which include non-alcoholic beverages, accounted for 67.6% of our food and beverage revenues and 30.4% of our total revenues during fiscal 2016. 
 Drink 
 Each of our locations also offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, signature cocktails, and premium spirits. We continually strive to innovate our beverage offerings, adding new beverages three times per year, including the introduction of fun beverage platforms such as our Luxe Patron LITs, Smashtails and Glow Kones. Beverage service is typically available throughout the entire store, allowing for multiple sales opportunities. We believe that our high margin beverage offering is complementary to each of the Eat, Play and Watch aspects of our brand. Our alcoholic beverage revenues accounted for 32.4% of our total food and beverage revenues and 14.6% of our total revenues during fiscal 2016. 
Play 
 The games in our Midway are a key aspect of the Dave & Busters entertainment experience, which we believe is the core differentiating feature of our brand. The Midway in each of our stores is an area where we offer a wide array of amusement and entertainment options, typically with over 150 redemption and simulation games. Most of our games are activated by game play credits on magnetic stripe cards or RFID devices (collectively, Power Cards). A customer purchases the game play credits or chips at an automated kiosk or from an employee. Our amusement and other revenues accounted for 55.0% of our total revenues during fiscal 2016. Redemption games, which represented 79.5% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2016, offer our customers the opportunity to win tickets that are redeemable at a retail-style space in our stores that we have branded WIN!, with prizes ranging from branded novelty items to high-end electronics. We believe this opportunity to win creates a fun and highly energized social experience that is an important aspect of the Dave & Busters in-store experience and cannot be easily replicated at home. Our video and simulation games, many of which can be played by multiple customers simultaneously and include some of the latest high-tech games commercially available, represented 17.2% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2016. Other traditional amusements represented the remainder of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2016. 
Watch 
 Sports-viewing is another key component of the entertainment experience at Dave & Busters. All of our stores have multiple large screen televisions and high quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports and other televised events. Our D&B Sports areas provide an immersive viewing environment that provides customers with an average of 40 televisions, including 100+ inch high definition televisions, to watch televised events and enjoy our full bar and extensive food menu. We believe that we have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience that offers a new reason for customers to visit Dave & Busters. Through continued development of the D&B Sports concept in new stores and additional renovations of existing stores, our goal is to build awareness of D&B Sports as the best place to watch sports and the only place to watch the games and play the games. 
Our Companys Core Strengths 
 We believe we benefit from the following strengths: 
 Strong, distinctive brand with broad customer appeal. We believe that the multi-faceted customer experience of Eat Drink Play and Watch at Dave & Busters, supported by our national marketing, has helped us create a widely recognized brand with no direct national competitor that combines all four elements in the same way. In markets where we have stores, over 90% of casual dining customers stated that they are aware of 
 
4 
 
 our brand as a dining and entertainment venue. Our customer research shows that our brand appeals to a relatively balanced mix of male and female adults, which is moderately skewed to males, primarily between the ages of 21 and 39, as well as families and teenagers. Based on customer survey results, we also believe that the average annual household income of our customers is in excess of $75, which we believe represents an attractive demographic. 
 Multi-faceted customer experience highlights our value proposition. We believe that our combination of interactive games, attractive television viewing areas, high-quality dining and full-service beverage offerings, delivered in a highly-energized atmosphere, provides a multi-faceted customer experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. We aim to offer our customers a value proposition comparable or superior to many of the separately available dining and entertainment options. We are continuously working with game manufacturers and food providers to create new games and food items at compelling price points to retain and generate customer traffic and improve the customer experience. Our value proposition is enhanced by what we consider to be innovative marketing initiatives, including our Eat & Play Combo (a promotion that provides a discounted Power Card in combination with select entrées), Super Charge Power Card offerings (when purchasing or adding value to a Power Card, the customer is given the opportunity to add more chips to the Power Card at a lower cost per chip amount), Half-Price Game Play (every Wednesday, from open to close, we reduce the price of every game in the Midway by one-half), Everyones a Winner (a limited-time offer providing a prize to every customer that purchases or adds value to a Power Card in the amount of ten dollars or more) and free game play promotions to feature the introduction of our new games. We believe these initiatives have helped increase customer visits and encourage customers to participate more fully across our broad range of food, beverage and entertainment offerings. 
 Vibrant, contemporary store design that integrates entertainment and dining. We believe we continue to benefit from enhancements to the Dave & Busters brand through our store design and D&B Sports initiatives, which began in fiscal 2011. Our current store design provides a contemporary, engaging atmosphere for our customers that includes clearly differentiated spaces, which are typically sub-branded as Eat at Busters, Gamebar, Daves Arcade, WIN! and D&B Sports, designed to convey each component of our customer value proposition: Eat Drink Play and Watch. Our store designs include a modern approach to the finishes and layout of the store, which we believe encourages participation across each of the stores elements. The oversized graphics and images throughout the store are intended to communicate our brand personality by being fun, contemporary and larger-than-life. The dining room décor includes booth and table seating and colorful artwork, often featuring local landmarks. Our WIN! area provides a retail-like environment where customers can redeem their tickets for prizes. All of our new locations opened since the beginning of fiscal 2011 incorporate our new store design. We believe the introduction and continued expansion of our D&B Sports concept, currently incorporated in approximately 80% of our store base, provides an attractive opportunity to market our broader platform to new and existing customers through a year-round calendar of programming and promotions tied to popular sporting events and sport-related activities. The large television screens, comfortable seating, a full menu of food and beverages and artwork often featuring images of local sports teams and sports icons help create what we believe to be an exciting environment for watching sports programming. We have strategically invested over $87,000 since the beginning of fiscal 2011 to introduce D&B Sports and modernize the exteriors, front lobbies, bars, dining areas and the WIN! area of select locations. During fiscal 2016, we completed the remodel of six stores and added D&B Sports branding to an additional three stores. As of the end of fiscal 2016, approximately 85% of our stores are either new or were remodeled to incorporate our new store design. 
 History of margin improvement. We have a proven track record of identifying operational efficiencies and implementing cost saving initiatives and have increased our net income by $98,090 and our Adjusted EBITDA Margins (defined in Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by approximately 970 basis points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2016. We expect our continued focus on operating performance at individual locations and leveraging general and administrative expense and advertising expense will continue to positively impact operating margins, although there is no guarantee that this will occur.

Store model generates favorable store economics and strong returns. We believe our store model offering entertainment, food and beverages provides certain benefits in comparison to traditional restaurant concepts, as reflected by our average annual comparable store revenues of $12,000 and average Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins (defined in Non-GAAP Financial Measures) of 32.5% for comparable stores in fiscal 2016. Our entertainment offerings have low variable costs and produced gross margins of 88.2% for fiscal 2016. With approximately 55.0% of our revenues from entertainment, we have less exposure than traditional restaurant concepts to food costs, which represented only 8.0% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016. Our business model generates strong cash flow that we can use to execute our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins, our refined new store formats and the fact that our stores typically open with high volumes that drive margins in year one will help us achieve our targeted average year one cash-on-cash returns in excess of 35% and five-year average cash-on-cash returns in excess of 25% for both our large format and small format store openings, however there is no guarantee such results will occur with future store openings. The 37 stores that we have opened since the beginning of 2008 (that have been open for more than 12 months as of January 29, 2017) have generated average year one cash-on-cash returns of 47.2%. The 29 stores that opened subsequent to fiscal 2010 have generated average year one cash-on-cash returns of 51.9%. We define and calculate cash-on-cash returns for an individual store as (a) Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, excluding pre-opening expenses, national marketing expense allocation, non-cash charges related to asset disposals, currency transactions and changes in non-cash deferred amusement revenue and ticket liability, divided by (b) our net development costs. Net development costs include equipment, building, leaseholds and site costs, net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord payments, excluding pre-opening costs and capitalized interest. 
 Commitment to customer satisfaction. We aim to enhance our combination of food, beverage and entertainment offerings through our service philosophy of providing a high quality and consistent customer experience through dedicated training and development of our team members and a corporate culture that encourages employee engagement. As a result, we have experienced significant improvement in our Guest Satisfaction Survey results since we began the surveys in 2007. In 2016, 82.9% of respondents to our Guest Satisfaction Survey rated us Top Box (score of 5 out of a possible 5) in Overall Experience and 84.5% of respondents rated us Top Box in Intent to Recommend. By comparison, in 2007, 44.0% of respondents rated us Top Box in Overall Experience and 64.8% of respondents rated us Top Box in Intent to Recommend. We utilize our loyalty program to market directly to members with promotional emails and location-based marketing. Through our loyalty program, we email offers and coupons to members and notify them of new games, food, drinks and local events. In addition, members can earn game play credits based on the dollar amount of qualifying purchases at our stores. We expect that as our loyalty program grows it will be an important method of maintaining customers connection with our brand and further drive customer satisfaction. 
 Experienced management team. We believe we are led by a strong senior management team averaging over 25 years of experience with national brands in all aspects of casual dining and entertainment operations. In 2006, we hired our Chief Executive Officer, Stephen King. From fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2016, under the leadership of Mr. King, net income has grown by $102,372 and Adjusted EBITDA Margins have increased by approximately 1,270 basis points and employee turnover and customer satisfaction metrics have improved significantly. We believe that our management teams prior experience in the restaurant and entertainment industries combined with its experience at Dave & Busters provides us with insights into our customer base and enables us to create the dynamic environment that is core to our brand. 
 Our Growth Strategies 
 The operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concept is built on the following key components: 
 Pursue disciplined new store growth. We will continue to pursue what we believe to be a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets where we feel we are capable of achieving consistently high store revenues and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins as well as strong cash-on-cash returns. We believe that the Dave & Busters brand is currently significantly under-penetrated, as internal studies and 
 
6 
 
 third-party research suggests a total store potential in the United States and Canada in excess of 200 stores (including our 92 stores as of the end of fiscal 2016). We believe our new store opportunity is split fairly evenly between large format and small format stores. We opened eleven stores in fiscal 2016. Store openings during the past five fiscal years were primarily financed with available cash and operating cash flows. In 2017 and thereafter, we believe that we can continue opening new stores at an annual growth rate of 10% or more of our then existing store base. 
 Our new store expansion strategy is driven by a site selection process that allows us to evaluate and select the location, size and design of our stores based on consumer research and analysis of operating data from sales in our existing stores. Our site selection process and flexible store design enable us to customize each store with the objective of maximizing return on capital given the characteristics of the market and the location. Our new store large formats are 30,001 to 45,000 square feet in size and our new store small formats span 25,000 to 30,000 square feet, which provides us the flexibility to enter new smaller markets and further penetrate existing markets. These formats also provide us with the ability to strategically choose between building new stores and converting existing space, which can be more cost efficient for certain locations. We are targeting average year one cash-on-cash returns in excess of 35% for both our large format and small format stores. To achieve this return for large format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $8,800 and first year store revenues of approximately $12,200. For small format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $6,800 and average first year store revenues of approximately $8,700. Additionally, we target average year one margins on Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (excluding allocated national marketing costs) of approximately 29%, for both large format and small format stores. 
 Grow our comparable store sales. We intend to grow our comparable store sales by seeking to differentiate the Dave & Busters brand from other food and entertainment alternatives, through the following strategies: 
 

 | Provide our customers the latest exciting games. We believe that our Midway games are the core differentiating feature of the Dave & Busters brand, and staying current with the latest offerings creates new content and excitement to drive repeat visits and increase length of customer stay. We plan to continually update our games each year through development of proprietary games and the purchase of new games that will resonate with our customers and drive brand relevance due to a variety of factors, including their large scale, eye-catching appearance, virtual reality features, association with recognizable brands or the fact that they cannot be easily replicated at home. We aim to leverage our investment in games by packaging our new game introductions featuring exclusive game offerings and focusing our marketing spending to promote these events. We also plan to continually elevate the redemption experience in our WIN! area with prizes that we believe customers will find more attractive, which we expect will favorably impact customer visitation and game play.

 | Leverage D&B Sports. In 2010, we initiated a program to improve our sports-viewing as part of our strategy to enhance our entertainment offering and increase customer traffic and frequency by creating another reason to visit Dave & Busters. This initiative evolved into the D&B Sports concept, which has been incorporated into all new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal 2013 and will continue to be incorporated into all new stores. We intend to continue leveraging our investments in D&B Sports by building awareness of Dave & Busters as the best place to watch sports and the only place to watch the games and play the games through national cable advertising. In addition, we are strategically expanding our year-round sporting and pay-per-view content to drive increased traffic and capture a higher share of the sports-viewing customer base.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Serve food and beverage offerings with broad appeal. Our menu has a variety of items, from hamburgers to steaks to seafood that represent our Fun American New Gourmet strategy. We aim to ensure a pipeline for three new product launches each year, aligning with the timing of our new game launches. This strategy has been well received by our customers as the percentage of customers rating our food quality as Excellent was 81.3% in fiscal 2016. Similarly, the percentage of customers rating our beverage quality as Excellent in fiscal 2016 was 84.9%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Grow our special events usage. The special events portion of our business represented 10.3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016. We believe our special events business is an important sampling and

promotional opportunity for our customers because many customers are experiencing Dave & Busters for the first time. We plan to leverage our existing special events sales force and call center to attract new corporate customers. In addition, we introduced online booking for social parties in order to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers and look to expand its functionality over time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enhance brand awareness and generate additional visits to our stores through marketing and promotions. We believe offering new items from each of the Eat Drink Play and Watch pillars will keep the brand relevant to customers and drive traffic and frequency. We have identified nine key promotional periods throughout the year when we feature this New News in national advertising. To increase national awareness of our brand, we plan to continue to invest a significant portion of our marketing expenditures in national cable television and radio advertising focused on promoting our capital investments in new games, D&B Sports and new food and beverage offerings. We also have customized local store marketing programs to increase new visits and repeat visits to individual locations. We will continue to utilize our loyalty program and digital efforts to communicate promotional offers directly to our most passionate brand fans, and we are aggressively optimizing our search engine and social marketing efforts. We also leverage our investments in technology across our marketing platform, including in-store marketing initiatives to drive incremental sales throughout the store.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Drive customer frequency through greater digital and mobile connectivity. We believe that there is a potential to increase customer frequency by enhancing the in-store and out-of-store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives as well as through implementing enhanced technology. We intend to leverage our growing loyalty database as well as continue to invest in other mobile applications to create customer connections and drive recurring customer visitation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Expand the Dave & Busters brand internationally. We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists in North America, the Dave & Busters brand can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We are currently assessing these opportunities while maintaining a conservative and disciplined approach towards the execution of our international development strategy. As such, we have retained the services of a third-party consultant to assist in identifying and prioritizing potential markets for expansion as well as potential franchise or joint venture partners. Thus far, we have identified our international market priorities and begun the process of identifying potential international partners within select markets. The market priorities were developed based on a specific set of criteria to ensure we expand our brand into the most attractive markets. We have signed a seven store franchising agreement for licensed development in six countries in the Middle East, and we are targeting our first international opening outside of Canada in 2018. 
 Site Selection 
 We believe that the location of stores is critical to our long-term success. The experience and relationships of our current development team has enabled us to focus our attention on the most relevant network of real estate brokers, which has given us access to a larger pool of qualified potential store sites. In addition, we believe the more contemporary look of our stores has been one of the key drivers in attracting new developers and building our new store pipeline. We devote significant time and resources to strategically analyze each prospective market, trade area and site. We continually identify, evaluate and update our database of potential locations for expansion. We base new site selection on an analytical evaluation of a set of drivers we believe increase the probability of successful, high-volume stores. 
Our Store Formats 
 We operate stores varying in size from 16,000 to 66,000 square feet. In order to optimize sales per square foot and further enhance our store economics, the target size of our future large format stores is expected to be 
 
8 
 
 between 30,001 and 45,000 square feet while our small format stores span 25,000 to 30,000 square feet. We may take advantage of local market and economic conditions to open stores that are larger or smaller than these target sizes. 
 We utilize our small format stores to penetrate less densely populated markets and backfill existing markets. The small format store has reduced the back-of-house space, and optimized the sales area dedicated to video and redemption games. We believe that the small store format will maintain the dynamic guest experience that is the foundation of our brand and allow us flexibility in our site selection process. We also believe that the small store format will allow us to take less capital investment risk per store. As a result, we expect these smaller format stores to achieve returns within our target range and enable us to expand into additional markets. We anticipate that approximately half of our new store openings will be large format and half will be small. At January 29, 2017, 17 of our 92 operating stores were the small store format. Our fiscal 2016 new store openings included eight large format stores and three small format stores. 
 Since fiscal 2010, we have completed major remodel projects at 29 locations as of January 29, 2017, including three in fiscal 2014, three in fiscal 2015 and six in fiscal 2016. Our focus in the remodeling initiative is to introduce D&B Sports and modernize the exteriors, front lobbies, bars, dining areas and WIN! area. We have received positive customer feedback related to the remodel projects completed to date. 
 Marketing, Advertising and Promotion 
 Our corporate marketing department manages all consumer-focused initiatives for the Dave & Busters brand. In order to drive sales and expand our customer base, we focus our efforts in three key areas: 

 | Marketing: national advertising, media, promotions, in-store merchandising, pricing, local and digital marketing programs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Food and beverage: menu and product development, in-store execution
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Customer insights: research, brand health and tracking
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 We spent approximately $33,795 in marketing efforts in fiscal 2016, $29,970 in fiscal 2015, and $29,144 in fiscal 2014. Our annual marketing expenditures include the cost of national television and radio advertising totaling $25,845, $22,551 and $20,553 in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We continually seek to improve our marketing effectiveness through a number of initiatives, including: 
 

 | refining our marketing strategy to better reach both young adults and families;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | creating new advertising campaigns;
--+------------------------------------


 | investing in menu research and development to differentiate our food offerings from our competition and improve key product attributes (quality, consistency, value and overall customer satisfaction) and execution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | developing product/promotional strategies to attract new customers and increase spending/length of stay;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | leveraging our loyalty database to engage and motivate customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | investing more in our customer loyalty program to create stronger relationships with consumers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reflecting a consistent brand identity that reflects our quality, heritage and energy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To drive traffic and increase visit frequency and average check size, the bulk of our marketing budget is allocated to our national cable television media. To enhance that effort, we also develop: 
 

 | local marketing plans, including radio and out-of-home;
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 

 | in-store promotions and point-of purchase materials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | customer loyalty programs, including promotional and trigger emails; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | digital programs, including social, search, website, mobile and display.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We work with external advertising, digital, media and design agencies in the development and execution of these programs. 
 Special Event Marketing 
 Our corporate and group sales programs are managed by our sales department, which provides direction, training, and support to the special events managers and their teams within each location. They are supported by a Special Events call center located at our Corporate Office, targeted print and online media plans, as well as promotional incentives at appropriate times during the year. In addition, we have online booking for social parties in order to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers. 
Operations 
 Management 
 The management of our store base is divided into twelve regions, each of which is overseen by a Regional Operations Manager, Regional Operations Director or Vice President of Operations (collectively Regional Management) who reports to the Chief Operating Officer. Our Regional Management oversee five to eleven stores each, which we believe enables them to better support the General Managers and achieve sales and profitability targets for each store within their region. In addition, we have one Regional Operations Director whose primary focus is on new store openings. 
 Our typical store team consists of a General Manager supported by an average of nine additional management positions. There is a defined structure of development and progression of job responsibilities from Area Operations Manager through various positions up to the General Manager role. This structure ensures that an adequate succession plan exists within each store. Each management member handles various departments within the location including responsibility for hourly employees. A typical store employs approximately 140 hourly employees, most of whom work part time. The General Manager and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day operation of that store, including the hiring, training and development of team members, as well as financial and operational performance. Our stores are generally open seven days a week, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight on Sunday through Thursday and 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. 
 Operational Tools and Programs 
 We utilize a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. We have developed customized labor scheduling tools designed to assist our managers in optimizing hourly labor based on anticipated sales volumes. We perform weekly test drives on our games to ensure that our amusement offerings are consistent with Dave & Busters standards and are operational. Consolidated reporting tools for key drivers of our business exist for our Regional Management to be able to identify and troubleshoot any systemic issues. 
Management Information Systems 
 We utilize a number of proprietary and third-party management information systems. These systems are designed to enable our games functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense. We believe our management information systems are sufficient to support our store expansion plans. 
 
10 
 
Training 
 We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, game playability and maintenance of our stores. We provide all new team members with complete orientation and one-on-one training for their positions to help ensure they are able to meet our high standards. All of our new team members are trained by partnering with a certified trainer to assure that the training and information they receive is complete and accurate. Team members are certified for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness training. 
 We require our new store managers to complete an eight-week training program that includes front-of-house service, kitchen, amusements and management responsibilities. Newly trained managers are then assigned to their home store where they receive additional training with their General Manager. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs in order to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We conduct semi-annual evaluations with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals. We hold an annual General Manager conference in which our General Managers share best practices and also receive an update on our business plan. 
 When we open a new store, we provide varying levels of training to team members in each position to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the store from the first day it opens to the public. Prior to opening a new store, our dedicated training and opening team travels to the location to prepare for an intensive two week training program for all team members hired for the new store opening. Part of the training team stays on site during the first week of operation. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important, because it helps us provide our customers with a quality experience from day one. 
 After a store has been opened and is operating smoothly, the store managers supervise the training of new team members. 
 Recruiting and Retention 
 We seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and team members, and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Our store managers all participate in a performance-based incentive program that is based on sales and profit goals. In addition, our salaried and hourly employees are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure. 
Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing 
 We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process. Within each store, the Kitchen Manager is primarily responsible for ensuring the timely and correct preparation of food products, per the recipes we specify. We provide each of our stores with various tools and training to facilitate these activities. 
Foreign Operations 
 We now own and operate two stores outside of the United States, in the Canadian province of Ontario, including one that opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These stores generated revenues of approximately $13,369 USD in fiscal 2016, $10,587 USD in fiscal 2015, and $10,611 USD in fiscal 2014, representing approximately 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. As of January 29, 2017, less than 3.0% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States.

The foreign activities of these stores are subject to various risks of doing business in a foreign country, including currency fluctuations, changes in laws and regulations and economic and political stability. We do not believe there is any material risk associated with the Canadian operations or any dependence by the domestic business upon the Canadian operations. 
 Store-Level Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality 
 We expect seasonality to be a factor in the operation or results of the business in the future with higher first and fourth quarter revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays. These quarters will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to the other quarters. 
 Suppliers 
 The principal goods used by us are redemption game prizes and food and beverage products, which are available from a number of suppliers. We have expanded our contacts with amusement merchandise suppliers through the direct import program, a program in which we purchase WIN! merchandise and certain glassware, plateware and furniture directly from offshore manufacturers. We are a large buyer of traditional and amusement games and as a result believe we receive discounted pricing arrangements. Federal and state health care mandates and mandated increases in the minimum wage and other macro-economic pressures could have the repercussion of increasing expenses, as suppliers may be adversely impacted and seek to pass on higher costs to us. 
Competition 
 The out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, arcades and entertainment centers, night clubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. We also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition on a national basis in the future from other concepts that are similar to ours. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. 
Intellectual Property 
 We have registered the trademarks Dave & Busters®, Power Card®, Eat & Play Combo®, Eat Drink Play®, and Eat Drink Play Watch®, and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our tradename and our logo to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to sign a code of ethics, which includes an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential. 
Employees 
 As of January 29, 2017, we employed 13,983 persons, 218 of whom served at our corporate headquarters, 925 of whom served as management personnel and the remainder of whom were hourly personnel. 
 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage, strike or labor dispute. We believe working conditions and compensation packages are competitive with those offered by competitors and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
