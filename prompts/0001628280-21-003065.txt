Item 1. Business
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
GENERAL
We are a publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership. Our common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "TCP". We were formed by TC Energy and its subsidiaries in 1998 to acquire, own and participate in the management of energy infrastructure businesses in North America. Our pipeline systems transport natural gas in the U.S.
We are managed by our General Partner, which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy. At December 31, 2020, subsidiaries of TC Energy owned approximately 24 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and hold a two percent general partner interest in us. See Part II, Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information regarding TC Energy's ownership in us.
RECENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
Planned merger with TC Energy: 
On October 5, 2020, the Partnership announced receipt of a non-binding offer from TC Energy to acquire all of its outstanding common units not beneficially owned by TC Energy, or its affiliates, in exchange for common shares of TC Energy. Under the initial proposal, holders of the outstanding TC PipeLines common units, other than TC Energy and its affiliates, (the Unaffiliated TCP Unitholders) would receive 0.65 common shares of TC Energy for each issued and outstanding publicly-held Partnership common unit.
The offer was made to the board of directors of the General Partner (TC PipeLines Board). As the general partner of the Partnership is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy, a conflicts committee composed of independent directors of the TC PipeLines Board (the Conflicts Committee) was formed to consider the offer pursuant to the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (Partnership Agreement).
On December 14, 2020, the Partnership, the General Partner, TC Energy, TransCan Northern Ltd., a Delaware corporation (TC Northern), TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd., a Nevada corporation (TC PipeLine USA), and TCP Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy (Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the TC Energy Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the TC Energy Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership (TC Energy Merger), with the Partnership continuing as the sole surviving entity and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the TC Energy Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the TC Energy Merger, each common unit representing a fractional part of the limited partner interests in the Partnership issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the TC Energy Merger held by an Unaffiliated TCP Unitholder, will be cancelled in exchange for 0.70 shares of TC Energy’s common shares.

The Conflicts Committee has approved the TC Energy Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommended that the Board direct that the TC Energy Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote of the limited partners for their approval at a special meeting and recommended that the Board recommend to the limited partners of the Partnership that the limited partners approve the TC Energy Merger Agreement and the TC Energy Merger. 
Based upon such recommendation, the Board has directed that the TC Energy Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the TC Energy Merger, be submitted to the limited partners for their approval at a special meeting, to be held at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, on February 26, 2021. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to the TC Energy Merger. For additional information regarding the TC Energy Merger Agreement and the TC PipeLines Board’s process and rationale for the TC Energy Merger, please see the definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on January 26, 2021 and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission when they become available.
COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19, a global pandemic. As the primary operator of our pipelines, TC Energy’s business continuity plans remain in place across the organization and TC Energy continues to effectively operate our assets, conduct commercial activities and execute on projects with a focus on health, safety and reliability. Our business is broadly considered essential in the United States given the important role our infrastructure plays in providing energy to North American markets. We believe that TC Energy’s robust continuity and business resumption plans for critical teams, including gas control and commercial and field operations, will continue to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of energy that our customers depend upon. 
Our pipeline assets are largely backed by long-term, take-or-pay contracts resulting in revenues that are materially insulated from short-term volatility associated with fluctuations in volume throughput and commodity prices. More importantly, a significant portion of our long-term contract revenue is with investment-grade customers and we have not experienced any material collection issues on our receivables to date. Aside from the impact of maintenance activities and normal seasonal factors, to date we have not seen any material changes in the utilization of our assets. Additionally, to date, we have not experienced any significant impacts on our supply chain. While it is too early to ascertain any long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our capital growth program, we note that we could experience some delay in construction and other related activities. 
Capital market conditions in 2020 were significantly impacted by COVID-19 resulting in periods of extreme volatility and reduced liquidity. Despite these challenges, our liquidity remains strong, underpinned by stable cashflow from operations, cash on hand and full access to our $500 million Senior Credit Facility. The recently concluded transactions described below demonstrate our continued access to the debt capital markets at attractive levels:
•During the second quarter of 2020, GTN's $100 million senior notes due in June 2020 were refinanced through a Note Purchase Agreement whereby GTN issued $175 million of 10-year Series A Senior Notes with a coupon rate of 3.12% with the incremental $75 million of proceeds to be used to fund the GTN XPress Project through the balance of 2020. Additionally, GTN entered into a 3-year private shelf agreement for a further $75 million which will be used to finance a portion of the GTN XPress Project into 2023; 
•During the third quarter of 2020, Tuscarora's $23 million unsecured term loan due in August 2020 was extended for one year to August 2021 under generally the same terms; and
•During the fourth quarter of 2020, PNGTS entered into a Note Purchase Agreement whereby PNGTS issued $125 million 10-year Series A Senior Notes with a coupon rate of 2.84%, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance of PNGTS' revolving credit facility. The remaining proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, including the funding of the Portland XPress project (PXP) and the Westbrook XPress project. PNGTS also entered into a 3-year private shelf agreement for an additional $125 million which will be used to finance the remaining capital spending required for the Westbrook XPress project into 2021.
We continue to conservatively manage our financial position, self-fund our ongoing capital expenditures and maintain our debt at prudent levels and we believe we are well positioned to fund our obligations through a prolonged period of disruption, should it occur. Based on current expectations, we believe our business will continue to deliver consistent financial performance going forward and support our current quarterly distribution level of $0.65 per common unit.
The full extent and lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy is uncertain but to date has included extreme volatility in financial markets and commodity prices, a significant reduction in overall economic activity and widespread extended shutdowns of businesses along with supply chain disruptions. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic has a more significant longer-term impact on our operations and growth projects will depend on future developments, policies and actions which remain highly uncertain. Additional information regarding risks and impacts on our business can be found throughout this section, including Part I, Item 1A - "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 7A - "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Impairment considerations:
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     9


Under U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our goodwill related to Tuscarora and North Baja for impairment at least annually or more frequently if any indicators of impairment are evident. Our long-lived assets and equity investments are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 
On a quarterly basis during 2020, we evaluated changes within our business and the external environment including considerations regarding whether such changes are permanent, to determine whether a triggering event had occurred. This analysis included the quarterly assessment of the impact of COVID-19 to our reporting units and equity investments. Through our quarterly analyses, no triggering events were identified.
 The following factors were considered in our analysis specific to the Partnership:
•a significant amount of our pipeline assets’ revenue is tied to long-term take-or-pay, fixed-price contracts which have a low correlation to short-term changes in demand;
•we have not experienced any material customer defaults to date and we hold collateral, as appropriate, to support our contracts;
•we evaluated the multiples and discount rate assumptions within the current economic environment and compared to the previous quantitative model used for our North Baja and Tuscarora reporting units. The multiples and discount rates identified for the current year used in our qualitative model are reflective of the long-term outlook for Tuscarora and North Baja, in line with their underlying asset lives; 
•while we may experience a slowdown in some of our construction activities, our current growth projects are materially on track, and we do not anticipate any significant changes in outlook, delays or inability to proceed due to financing requirements; and 
•our businesses are broadly considered essential in the United States given the important role these pipeline infrastructure assets play in delivering energy to the market areas we serve.
While the issues described above continue to persist, we continue to believe no impairment exists on our goodwill, equity investments or long-lived assets. However, future adverse changes to our key considerations could change our conclusion. 
Growth Projects Update:
PNGTS’ Portland XPress Project (PXP) - PXP was initiated in 2017 in order to expand deliverability on the PNGTS system to Dracut, Massachusetts through re-contracting and construction of incremental compression within PNGTS’ existing footprint in Maine. PXP was designed to be phased in over a three-year time period. Phases I and II were placed into service in 2018 and 2019, respectively, with the final Phase III placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2020. Beginning in 2021, PXP is expected to generate approximately $50 million in annual revenue for PNGTS. The total final volume of the project is approximately 183,000 Dth/day; 40,000 Dth/day from Phase I, 118,400 Dth/day from Phase II, which includes re-contracting and renewal of expiring contracts, and 24,600 Dth/day from Phase III. PXP is secured by long-term agreements and now that all phases of the project are in service, PNGTS is effectively fully contracted until 2032.
Additionally, in connection with PXP, PNGTS entered into an arrangement with TC Energy regarding the construction of certain facilities on the TC Energy system (TransQuebec and Maritimes Pipeline (TQM) and TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline natural gas transmission system (Canadian Mainline)) that were required to fulfill PXP contracts on the PNGTS system. In the event the Canadian system expansions had terminated prior to their in-service dates, PNGTS could have been required to reimburse TC Energy for an amount up to the total outstanding costs incurred to the date of the termination. As a result of placing the TC Energy facilities associated with the Phases I, II and III volumes in service, PNGTS' reimbursement obligation to TC Energy relating to this project has been extinguished. 
PNGTS' Westbrook XPress Project (Westbrook XPress) - Westbrook XPress is an estimated $125 million multi-phase expansion project that is expected to generate approximately $35 million in revenue for PNGTS on an annualized basis when fully in service. It is part of a coordinated offering to transport incremental Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) natural gas supplies to the Northeast U.S. and Atlantic Canada markets through additional compression capability at an existing PNGTS facility. Westbrook XPress is designed to be phased in over a four-year period which began on November 1, 2019 with Phase I. On June 18, 2020, FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity for Phases II and III for this project. On January 9, 2021, construction crews and equipment were mobilized to the existing Westbrook Compressor Station following the authorization received from FERC by PNGTS on January 6, 2021. Phases II and III have estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and 2022, respectively. These three Phases will add incremental capacity of approximately 43,000 Dth/day, 69,000 Dth/day, and 18,000 Dth/day, respectively. Westbrook XPress, together with PXP, will increase PNGTS’ capacity by 90 percent from 210,000 Dth/day to approximately 400,000 Dth/day. The Westbrook XPress contracts expire between 2036 and 2042.
Iroquois Gas Transmission ExC Project - In 2019, Iroquois initiated the “Enhancement by Compression” project (Iroquois ExC Project) which will optimize the Iroquois system to meet current and future gas supply needs of utility customers while minimizing the environmental impact through enhancements at existing compressor stations along the pipeline. In February 2020, Iroquois filed an application with FERC to authorize the construction of the project. On September 30, 2020, FERC issued its Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Iroquois ExC Project. The EA concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The 
10     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


project’s total design capacity is approximately 125,000 Dth/day with an estimated cost of $250 million and in-service date of November 2023. This project will be 100 percent underpinned with 20-year contracts.
North Baja XPress Project (North Baja XPress) - North Baja XPress is an estimated $90 million project to transport additional volumes of natural gas along North Baja’s mainline system. The project was initiated in response to market demand to provide firm transportation service of approximately 495,000 Dth/day between Ehrenberg, Arizona and Ogilby, California. The binding open season for the project was concluded in April of 2019. In December 2019, North Baja filed an application with FERC to authorize the construction of this project. On September 8, 2020, FERC issued its Environmental Assessment (EA) for the North Baja XPress Project. The EA concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. North Baja XPress was subject to a Final Investment Decision (FID) by Sempra LNG International, LLC, (Sempra LNG) regarding the development, construction and operation of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Baja California, Mexico and on November 17, 2020, Sempra LNG reached a positive FID on the project. North Baja XPress has an estimated in-service date of February 2023 and is still subject to regulatory approvals and other requirements of the project. 
Great Lakes Long-term Contracts Related to ANR's Alberta XPress Project - On February 12, 2020, TC Energy approved the Alberta XPress Project, an expansion project on its ANR Pipeline system with an estimated in-service date of 2022. This project utilizes existing capacity on the Great Lakes system (of which we own 46.45 percent) and TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline systems to connect growing natural gas supply from the WCSB to U.S. Gulf Coast LNG export markets. In 2018, Great Lakes entered into long-term transportation capacity contracts with ANR for approximately 900,000 Dth/day of aggregate capacity for a term of 15 years. In connection with the approval of the Alberta XPress Project, such contracts have been reduced to provide for approximately 168,000 Dth/day of aggregate capacity for a term of 20 years at maximum rates for a total contract value of $182 million starting in 2022. The contract contains reduction options (i) at any time on or before October 1, 2022 for any reason and (ii) at any time, if ANR is not able to secure the required regulatory approval related to its anticipated expansion projects. Any remaining unsubscribed capacity on Great Lakes will be available for contracting in response to developing marketing conditions. In June 2020, ANR filed an application with FERC to authorize construction of the project. On December 4, 2020, FERC issued its Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Alberta XPress Project. The EA concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In the first quarter of 2021, Alberta XPress has been modified to reflect revised shipper commitments. ANR has not exercised its contract reduction rights as a result of the revised shipper commitments on Alberta XPress. In the event of a contract reduction, the remaining unsubscribed capacity on Great Lakes will be available for contracting.
GTN XPress Project – In March 2020, GTN filed applications with FERC to authorize the replacement of certain facilities on the GTN system. Once in service, the replacements will increase the reliability of existing transportation service including 100,000 Dth/day of existing, long-term, full-haul system capacity. In 2021, GTN will file an application with FERC for the installation of an additional compressor at a brownfield compressor site and other related work. Once in service, this work will increase GTN's long-term system capacity by an incremental 150,000 Dth/day. The estimated total project cost of this integrated reliability and expansion project is $335 million. The project’s reliability work is anticipated to be in service by the end of 2021 and will account for more than three quarters of the total project cost. These costs are expected to be recovered in recourse rates. The project’s expansion work is anticipated to be commercially phased into service through November 2023. GTN XPress’ expansion work is 100 percent underpinned by fixed rate negotiated contracts with an average term in excess of 30 years. The incremental capacity is expected to generate approximately $25 million in revenue annually when fully in service.
Laws and Regulation
2020 PIPES Act – On December 27, 2020, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (2020 PIPES Act) was signed into law as part of a broader federal spending and COVID-19 relief package. In addition to authorizing funding for PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs through fiscal year 2023, the 2020 PIPES Act provides several substantive amendments to the federal pipeline safety statutes, including requiring PHMSA to provide public notice of enforcement hearings and ensuring that formal hearings are open to the public, issue new rules implementing a leak detection and repair program, and determine whether to proceed with rulemaking to update class location requirements. President Biden's administration will have responsibility for implementing the 2020 PIPES Act and we are in the process of assessing impacts associated with this new legislation. See also Part I, Item 1. “Business- Government Regulation-Pipeline Safety Matters” for more information relating to PHSMA regulation of gas pipelines.
NEPA Final Rule – On July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), under former President Trump's administration, published a final rule modifying the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The modified final rule establishes a time limit of two years for preparation of environmental impact statements and one year for the preparation of environmental assessments. The modified rule also eliminates the responsibility to consider cumulative effects of a project. The final rule is being widely criticized by environmental and conservation groups and is facing court challenges. The Partnership sees these updates as positive for the industry, as CEQ streamlines the review process. However, the updated rules may be delayed due to congressional review or litigation or President Biden's Administration may direct CEQ to reconsider or withdraw the rule. 
FERC's Instant Final Rule – The Natural Gas Act (NGA) allows intervening parties to file requests for rehearing with FERC within thirty days after FERC issues an order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity and prohibits any party from appealing such a certificate order to the courts without having received a final ruling from FERC. In lieu of following the statutory requirement of thirty days to respond to a rehearing request, FERC used “tolling orders” effectively granting itself more 
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     11


time. This prevented the requester from being able to appeal the certificate to the courts, while FERC continued to grant notices to proceed with construction (NTPs) with the requests for rehearing still pending.
Intervening parties recently challenged the tolling order practice in court. Prior to the court’s decision, on June 9, 2020, FERC issued an Instant Final Rule (IFR) prohibiting it from issuing NTPs while rehearing requests are pending. On June 30, 2020, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion prohibiting FERC from utilizing tolling orders without any substantive ruling. 
The IFR and the D.C. Circuit Opinion together cause concern that potential delays may occur in the certification process given that FERC will need to issue decisions on rehearing requests in a much shorter timeframe. 
The Partnership believes that under the current framework, these issuances will likely have a small impact on our pending and future projects, if any at all. Many of our projects in execution are largely compression-based and involve little-to-no greenfield construction, which have tended to be less likely to draw a rehearing request. However, certain avenues still exist for FERC to extend the time period longer, FERC continues to retain discretion over when to issue a notice to proceed, and the current framework may be modified by legislation (some of which has already been proposed) or a potential further appeal to the United States Supreme Court, therefore we cannot know the impact of FERC's IFR with certainty at this time.
Environmental (Water) – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and EPA Rulemaking: In 2020, considerable steps were taken by the USACE and EPA, under former President Trump's administration, to define the scope of waters federally regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), known as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), as well as the framework and implementation of CWA permitting and certification programs that Partnership projects are regulated under. For example, while constructing, maintaining, repairing, and/or replacing our pipelines and related facilities, our activities may discharge dredged or fill material into WOTUS and, in effect, may require a CWA Section 401 water quality certification and CWA Section 404 general permit, such as Nationwide Permit (NWP) 12. On June 22, 2020 a revised, narrower, definition of WOTUS, as proposed by the EPA and USACE, became effective. On September 11, 2020, EPA’s rule clarifying various aspects of the CWA Section 401 water quality certification process, became effective. The final WOTUS and Section 401 certification rules, which are both very favorable to our permitted activities and business, were subsequently challenged in federal courts, with litigation still pending. 
Additionally, the CWA Section 404 NWP Program has been under increased national scrutiny since April 15, 2020, when a Montana federal District Court ruled against TC Energy’s use of an allegedly invalid NWP 12 for the performance of construction activities affecting WOTUS in Montana for its Keystone XL oil pipeline project (the Presidential Permit for which was revoked on January 20, 2021 by executive order of President Biden) and enjoined the USACE from issuing NWP 12s to authorize any and all utility projects nationwide (later narrowed to only oil and gas pipeline construction projects) until the USACE resolved the Court’s identified compliance issue. The scope of the District Court ruling, the ensuing appeal of the ruling to higher courts, and subsequent lawsuits against other pipeline projects’ use of NWP 12 on similar grounds, have created a great deal of uncertainty around the continued use of NWP 12 for projects. Additionally, rulemaking undertaken by the USACE in 2020 to reissue or renew the 2017 NWPs, which are set to expire in 2022, may have increased the uncertainty surrounding the use of NWP 12. The final rule, which reissued 12 existing NWPs, included a restructured NWP 12 that separated utilities covered under the permit into three NWPs, with the more contentious oil and gas pipelines isolated from the rest. The reissuance also did not rectify the ESA non-compliance at the center of the legal dispute in the Keystone XL NWP litigation. The USACE’s final rule will become effective in March 2021. The uncertainty surrounding NWP 12 as a result of the pending litigation and USACE may materially affect the Partnership’s business, particularly with the arrival of President Biden's administration. For further discussion on environmental matters, see Part I, Item 1 “Government Regulation” – “Environmental Matters”.
Environmental (Species) –The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), under former President Trump, spent 2020 developing a rule which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) will apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs and not those lawful activities, such as pipeline facility construction, maintenance, repair, and related activities, which inadvertently result in the “incidental take” of migratory birds. This controversial rulemaking is beneficial to the Partnership, but if reversed by President Biden’s administration, the Partnership may continue being subject to the criminal liability associated with the "incidental take" of migratory birds, their nests, and their eggs under the MBTA, which may have a material effect on the Partnership. Additionally, former President Trump's administration also finalized two notable Endangered Species Act (ESA) rules in December 2020. One rule established a definition for “habitat” for the limited purpose of designating critical habitat and another rule which established the process and factors to be considered when determining whether to exclude certain lands from critical habitat designations, controversially including economic impacts. For further discussion on environmental matters, see Part I, Item 1 “Government Regulation” – “Environmental Matters”.
Environmental (Air) – Federal and State Climate Change Regulations –The trend towards increased regulation of GHG emissions in the oil and natural gas sector to combat climate change was evident in federal and state agency rulemaking in 2020, predominantly at the state level. On August 13, 2020, the EPA issued policy and technical amendments to lessen the administrative and compliance cost burden on the oil and gas industry related to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). One of the rules, imposing policy amendments and dated to be effective on September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the source category and rescinded methane and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) requirements for remaining sources. The amendments are currently being challenged in federal court. Notwithstanding these legal challenges, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 that specifically directed the EPA to review the technical amendments and to propose revisions to existing source standards. The more controversial policy amendment is expected to be addressed soon. Additionally, on December 27, 2020, former President Trump signed into law the 2020 PIPES Act, which includes a requirement for PHMSA to regulate methane emissions from pipelines, joining EPA as one of two federal 
12     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


regulators of GHG emissions. State and local governments are also increasingly regulating GHGs, potentially leading to additional compliance costs and operating restrictions. For example, Oregon is undertaking rulemaking to develop a carbon cap and reduce program at the direction of its Governor. Local governments in those states are also moving towards building electrification, cutting demand for hydrocarbon energy sources. For further discussion on environmental matters, see Part I, Item 1 “Government Regulation” – “Environmental Matters”.
Cash Distributions to Common Units and our General Partner

On April 21, 2020, the TC PipeLines Board declared the Partnership’s first quarter 2020 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on May 12, 2020 to unitholders of record as of May 1, 2020. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to our General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
On July 23, 2020, the TC PipeLines Board declared the Partnership’s second quarter 2020 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on August 14, 2020 to unitholders of record as of August 3, 2020. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to our General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
On October 21, 2020, the TC PipeLines Board declared the Partnership’s third quarter 2020 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on November 13, 2020 to unitholders of record as of November 2, 2020. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to our General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
On January 19, 2021, the TC PipeLines Board declared the Partnership’s fourth quarter 2020 cash distribution in the amount of $0.65 per common unit, which was paid on February 12, 2020 to unitholders of record as of January 29, 2020. The declared distribution totaled $47 million and was paid in the following manner: $46 million to common unitholders (including $4 million to the General Partner as a holder of 5,797,106 common units and $7 million to another subsidiary of TC Energy as a holder of 11,287,725 common units) and $1 million to the General Partner for its two percent general partner interest.
Incentive distributions are paid to our General Partner if quarterly cash distributions on the common units exceed levels specified in the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (as amended, the Partnership Agreement). The distributions declared during 2020 did not reach the specified levels for any period and, therefore, the General Partner did not receive any distributions in respect of its IDRs in 2020. See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cash Distribution Policy of the Partnership” for further information regarding the Partnership’s distributions. 
To date, there has been no annual Class B distribution for 2021. In 2020, the Class B distribution paid was $8 million. Please read Note 11 within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” for more detailed disclosure on the Class B units.
Other Business Developments
Northern Border complaint - On March 31, 2020, BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp., Oasis Petroleum Marketing LLC and Tenaska Marketing Ventures (the Alliance for Open Markets) filed a complaint with FERC (Docket No. RP20-745-000) against Northern Border alleging that Northern Border violated Sections 4 and 5 of the NGA FERC policy, and other regulations by (i) failing to post capacity as available on a long-term basis before entering into a prearranged transaction for six agreements with ONEOK Rockies Midstream, L.L.C.; (ONEOK Midstream) and (ii) structuring the prearranged transaction open season in a manner that denied other shippers a meaningful opportunity to bid on the capacity. On April 2, 2020, ConocoPhillips Company, Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. and XTO Energy Inc. (the Indicated Shippers, together with the Alliance for Open Markets, the Complainants) filed a second complaint with FERC (Docket No. RP20-767-000) against Northern Border containing similar allegations regarding the prearranged transaction open season. The Complainants have requested that FERC (a) unwind the six prearranged contracts; (b) require Northern Border to hold an open season for the capacity such that all interested parties are on equal footing; and (c) direct Northern Border to cease from engaging in prearranged transactions where the unsubscribed capacity has not been publicly posted as generally available. 
The prearranged contracts range in volume from 40,000 to 269,732 Dth/day for terms ranging from 10 months to 10 years, two of which began on June 1, 2020. Northern Border filed a motion to consolidate the two complaint dockets and filed its response to the complaints on May 1, 2020. On June 1,2020, updated tariff sheets reflecting the contract price were filed by Northern Border with FERC for the two contracts set to begin June 1, 2020. On July 1, 2020, FERC issued an order and accepted the tariff sheets, subject to the outcome of complaint proceedings. 
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     13


On October 15, 2020, FERC issued an order on the complaints and directed Northern Border to (1) refrain from making similar, discriminatory awards of capacity in the future, (2) rescind the pre-arranged deals with ONEOK Midstream, effective October 15, 2020, and (3) hold a new open season without a pre-arranged shipper. In addition, FERC directed Northern Border to file revisions to its tariff requiring it to post capacity on its website before entering a pre-arranged deal. FERC did not order Northern Border to refund any of the revenue earned from the pre-arranged transactions with ONEOK Midstream. 
Northern Border held an open season from October 21 to 28, 2020 to remarket the capacity. Final bids were evaluated and the successful bids reflect a revenue that approximates Northern Border’s maximum recourse rates, a reduction from the pre-arranged contract rate.
Great Lakes 501-G Proceeding - On May 11, 2020, FERC terminated Great Lakes’ 501-G proceeding and ruled that Great Lakes had complied with the one-time reporting requirement, designated as FERC Form No. 501-G related to the rate effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). Additionally, FERC also stated that rate reductions provided for in Great Lakes' 2017 settlement and the 2.0% rate reduction from the Limited Section 4 Rate Reduction proceeding have provided substantial rate relief for Great Lakes’ shippers and as a result, FERC will not exercise its right to institute a NGA Section 5 investigation to determine if Great Lakes is over-recovering on its current tariff rates.
Commercial system purchase - On August 1, 2020, GTN, Great Lakes, Tuscarora and North Baja entered into a purchase agreement with a TC Energy affiliate to purchase an internally developed customer-facing commercial natural gas transmission information technology (IT) application that maintains and manages customer contracts, natural gas capacity release, customer nominations, metering and billings. The total value of the transaction was $51 million and the Partnership's proportionate share of the cost was $38 million. Prior to the transaction close, GTN, Great Lakes, Tuscarora and North Baja each paid the affiliate for the use of this system as part of their ongoing operating expenses. As a result of the capital purchase, the amount paid by each pipeline will be added to its respective rate base and utilized in the calculation of maximum allowable rates. 
Iroquois' Wright Interconnect Project - During the first quarter of 2020, Iroquois received a notice of termination of its precedent agreement with Constitution pipeline related to its Wright Interconnect Project. In April 2020, Iroquois exercised its contractual right for reimbursement through a guarantee from Williams Partners, L.P., a 41 percent owner of the Constitution pipeline project. During the third quarter of 2020, the parties reached an agreement for a $48.5 million reimbursement of project costs, recovering all but $3 million of capital expenditures spent by Iroquois on the project. The proceeds received by Iroquois were distributed to its partners, of which the Partnership's proportionate share was approximately $24 million. The proceeds received by the Partnership were treated as a return of capital and used for general partnership purposes. 
Great Lakes' Contract with TC Energy's Canadian Mainline - As noted in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 2019 (2019 Annual Report), a significant portion of Great Lakes’ total contract portfolio is contracted by its affiliates including its long-term transportation agreement with TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline (Canadian Mainline) that commenced on November 1, 2017 for a ten-year period that allows TC Energy to transport up to 0.711 billion cubic feet (equivalent to about 722,000 Dth/day) of natural gas per day on the Great Lakes system. This contract contained a volume reduction option up to full contract quantity until November 1, 2020. During the fourth quarter, the Canadian Mainline requested an extension on the volume reduction option deadline and Great Lakes extended the option expiry to November 16, 2020 and then again until November 20, 2020. 
On November 20, 2020, both parties came to an agreement. Effective November 1, 2021 the original contract rate will be reduced with no changes in the contracted volume. Additionally, after November 20, 2020, the Canadian Mainline shall have the right to reduce the contracted volume or terminate the full contract, effective November 1st of the applicable year, provided that 349 days’ prior written notice has been given to Great Lakes. As of February 24, 2021, no further changes to this contract have been made. The future revenue reduction on Great Lakes from the revised contract is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership's expected distributions from Great Lakes. 
Financing and Credit Ratings
GTN financing - On June 1, 2020, GTN’s $100 million 5.29 percent Senior Notes matured and were refinanced through a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement whereby GTN issued $175 million of 10-year Series A Senior Notes with a fixed coupon rate of 3.12 percent per annum and entered into a three-year private shelf agreement for an additional $75 million. The new Series A Senior Notes do not require any principal payments until maturity on June 1, 2030. Proceeds from the Series A Senior Note issuance were used to repay the outstanding balance of the 5.29 percent Senior Notes and to fund the GTN XPress capital expenditures through the balance of 2020. GTN expects to draw the remaining $75 million available under the 3-year private shelf agreement for an additional $75 million of Senior Notes (GTN Private Shelf Facility) by the end of 2023, the estimated completion date of the GTN XPress Project. The GTN Private Shelf Agreement contains a covenant that limits total debt to no greater than 65 percent of GTN’s total capitalization. 
Tuscarora financing - On July 23, 2020, Tuscarora's $23 million Unsecured Term Loan due August 21, 2020 was amended to extend the maturity date to August 20, 2021 under generally the same terms.
PNGTS financing - On October 8, 2020, PNGTS entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement whereby PNGTS issued $125 million of 10-year Series A Senior Notes with a coupon of 2.84% per annum and entered into a three-year private shelf agreement for an additional $125 million Senior Notes. The PNGTS Series A Notes do not require any principal payments 
14     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


until maturity on October 8, 2030. Proceeds from the Series A Senior Note issuance were used to repay the outstanding balance of PNGTS' revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes including funding of growth capital. PNGTS expects to draw the remaining $125 million available under the 3-year private shelf agreement for an additional $125 million of Senior Notes (PNGTS Private Shelf Facility) by the end of third quarter of 2021 to refinance amounts funded on its revolving credit facility for costs associated with the Westbrook XPress Project. The PNGTS Private Shelf Facility contains a covenant that limits total debt to no greater than 65 percent of PNGTS’ total capitalization and requires PNGTS to maintain a leverage ratio of no greater than 5.00 to 1.00.
GTN credit rating affirmation -On January 21, 2021, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) affirmed GTN's A3 credit rating and revised GTN's outlook to stable from negative primarily in connection with the revision of TC Energy's outlook to stable from negative.
Great Lakes' credit rating upgrade - On June 21, 2020, Standard & Poor's (S&P) upgraded Great Lakes' credit rating by two notches from BBB-/Stable to BBB+/Stable primarily due to an improvement in Great Lakes' financial risk profile resulting from its increased long-term contracting levels.
PNGTS credit rating upgrade - On July 24, 2020, Fitch upgraded PNGTS' credit rating by one notch from BBB/Stable to BBB+/Stable primarily due to an improvement in PNGTS' financial risk profile resulting from placing is PXP Phase II Project in-service on November 1, 2019.
Northern Border credit rating upgrade – On September 3, 2020, S&P affirmed Northern Border’s credit rating at BBB+ and upgraded the outlook from Stable to Positive based on strong recontracting, continued stable cash flows, conservative leverage, solid shipper base and strong sponsors. 
Credit rating affirmation - On September 30, 2020, S&P affirmed the Partnership's BBB/Stable credit rating. S&P continues to consider the Partnership's business risk profile to be a key strength underpinned by its highly contracted, long-term, take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy counterparties. S&P further recognizes the Partnership's strong basin diversification and benefits associated with its strategic relationship with TC Energy despite the expected higher leverage due to the funding of its growth projects. On October 30, 2020, Moody's also affirmed the Partnership's credit rating at Baa2/Stable. 
On October 6, 2020 S&P revised the Partnership's outlook from Stable to Creditwatch Positive in connection with TC Energy's offer to acquire the Partnership's outstanding common units. The Creditwatch reflects S&P's opinion that TC Energy's offer to acquire all of the outstanding units will increase the level of parental support from TC Energy. Tuscarora was also placed on Creditwatch Positive.
$350 million Senior Notes redemption - The Partnership's $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.65 percent Unsecured Senior Notes mature on June 15, 2021. On February 12, 2021, the Partnership exercised its option to redeem the Unsecured Senior Notes on March 15, 2021 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes then outstanding, plus unpaid interest accrued to March 15, 2021. Partial funding for the redemption is expected to be provided using cash on hand, and borrowings under the Partnership’s $500 million Senior Credit Facility.
Business Strategies
•Our strategy is focused on generating long-term, steady and predictable distributions to our unitholders by investing in long-life critical energy infrastructure that provides reliable delivery of energy to customers.
•Our investment approach is to develop or acquire assets that provide stable cash distributions and opportunities for new capital additions, while maintaining a low-risk profile. We are opportunistic and disciplined in our approach when identifying new investments.
•Our goal is to maximize distributable cash flows over the long-term through efficient utilization of our pipeline systems and appropriate business strategies, while maintaining a commitment to safe and reliable operations.
Understanding the Natural Gas Infrastructure Business
Natural gas infrastructure moves natural gas from major sources of supply or upstream gathering facilities to downstream locations or markets that use natural gas to meet their energy needs. Infrastructure systems include meter stations that record how much natural gas comes on to the pipeline and how much exits at the delivery locations; compressor stations that act like pumps to move the large volumes of natural gas along the pipeline; and the pipelines themselves that transport natural gas under high pressure.
Regulation, rates and cost recovery
Interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated by FERC. FERC approves the construction of new facilities and regulates aspects of our business including the maximum rates that are allowed to be charged. Maximum rates are based on operating costs, which include allowances for operating and maintenance costs, income and property taxes, interest on debt, depreciation expense to recover invested capital and a return on the capital invested. During 2018, FERC issued a revised policy statement that changed its long-standing policy on the treatment of income taxes for rate-making purposes for MLP-owned pipelines. The revised policy statement had a significant impact on MLPs in general and on their respective natural gas pipeline assets. (See also Part I, Item 1. “Business- Government Regulation- 2018 FERC Actions for” more information).
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     15


Although FERC regulates maximum rates for services, interstate natural gas pipelines frequently face competition and therefore may choose to discount their services in order to compete.
Because FERC rate reviews are periodic and not annual, actual revenues and costs typically vary from those projected during a rate case. If revenues no longer provide a reasonable opportunity to recover costs, a pipeline can file with FERC for a determination of new rates, subject to any moratoriums in effect. FERC also has the authority to initiate a review to determine whether a pipeline’s rates of return are just and reasonable. In some cases, a settlement or agreement with the pipeline’s shippers is achieved, precluding the need for FERC to conduct a rate case, which may include mutually beneficial performance incentives. A settlement is ultimately subject to FERC approval.
Contracting
New infrastructure projects are typically supported by long-term contracts. The term of the contracts is dependent on the individual developer’s appetite for risk and is a function of expected rates of return, stability and certainty of returns. Transportation contracts expire at varying times and underpin varying amounts of capacity. As existing contracts approach their expiration dates, efforts are made to extend and/or renew the contracts. If market conditions are not favorable at the time of renewal, transportation capacity may remain uncontracted, be contracted at lower rates or be contracted on a shorter-term basis. Unsold capacity may be recontracted if and when market conditions become more favorable. The ability to extend and/or renew expiring contracts and the terms of such subsequent contracts will depend upon the overall commercial environment for natural gas transportation and consumption in the region in which the pipeline is situated.
Business environment
The North American natural gas infrastructure network has been developed to connect supply basins to market. Use and growth of the systems are affected by changes in the location, relative cost of natural gas supply and changing market demand.
The map below shows the location of certain North American basins in relation to our systems together with those of our General Partner and TC Energy.
Supply
Natural gas is primarily transported from producing regions and, in limited circumstances, from liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities to market hubs or interconnects for distribution to natural gas consumers. The ongoing development of shale and other unconventional gas reserves has resulted in increases in overall North American natural gas production and economically recoverable reserves.
16     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


There has been an increase in production from the development of shale gas reserves that are located close to traditional markets, particularly in the Northeastern U.S. This has increased the number of supply choices for natural gas consumers and has contributed to the decline of higher-cost sources of supply (such as certain offshore gas production from Atlantic Canada) resulting in changes to historical natural gas pipeline flow patterns.
The supply of natural gas in North America is expected to continue increasing over the next decade and over the long-term for a number of reasons, including the following:
•use of technology, including horizontal drilling in combination with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, is allowing companies to access unconventional resources economically. This is increasing the technically accessible resource base of existing and emerging gas basins; and
•application of these technologies to existing oil fields where further recovery of the existing resource is now possible. There is often associated natural gas discovered in the exploration and production of liquids-rich hydrocarbons (for example the Bakken oil fields), which also contributes to an increase in the overall natural gas supply for North America.
Other factors that can influence the overall level of natural gas supply in North America include:
•the price of natural gas – low prices in North America may increase demand but reduce drilling activities that in turn diminish production levels, particularly in dry natural gas fields where the extra revenue generated from the associated liquids is not available. High natural gas prices may encourage higher drilling activities but may decrease the level of demand;
•producer portfolio diversification – large producers often diversify their portfolios by developing several basins, but this is influenced by actual costs to develop the resource as well as economic access to markets and cost of pipeline transportation services. Basin-on-basin competition impacts the extent and timing of a resource development that, in turn, drives changing dynamics for pipeline capacity demand; and
•regulatory and public scrutiny – changes in regulations that apply to natural gas production and consumption could impact the cost and pace of development of natural gas in North America.
Demand
The natural gas pipeline business ultimately depends on a shipper’s demand for pipeline capacity and the price paid for that capacity. Demand for pipeline capacity is influenced by, among other things, supply and market competition, economic activity, weather conditions, natural gas pipeline and storage competition and the price of alternative fuels.
The growing supply of natural gas has resulted in relatively low natural gas prices in North America which has supported increased demand for natural gas particularly in the following areas:
•natural gas-fired power generation;
•petrochemical and industrial facilities;
•the production of the Marcellus, Alberta’s oil sands, and the Bakken and shale deposits, although new greenfield projects that have not begun construction may be delayed in the current oil price environment;
•exports to Mexico to fuel electric power generation facilities; and
•exports from North America to global markets through a number of proposed LNG export facilities.
Commodity Prices
In general, the profitability of the natural gas pipelines business is not directly tied to commodity prices given we are a transporter of the commodity and the transportation costs are not tied to the price of natural gas. However, the cyclical supply and demand nature of commodities and its price impact can have a secondary impact on our business where our shippers may choose to accelerate or delay certain projects. This can impact the timing for the demand of transportation services and/or new gas pipeline infrastructure.
Competition
Competition among natural gas pipelines is based primarily on transportation rates and proximity to natural gas supply areas and consuming markets. Changes in supply locations and regional demand have resulted in changes to pipeline flow dynamics. Where pipelines historically transported natural gas from one or two supply sources to their markets under long-term contracts, today many pipelines transport gas in multiple directions and under shorter contract terms. Some pipelines have even reversed their flows in order to adapt to changing sources of supply. Competition among pipelines to attract supply and new or existing markets to their systems has also increased across North America.
Our Natural Gas Infrastructure
We have ownership interests in eight natural gas interstate pipeline systems that are collectively designed to transport approximately 11.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from producing regions and import facilities to market hubs and consuming markets primarily in the Western, Midwestern and Eastern U.S. All our pipeline systems, except Iroquois and the pipeline facilities jointly owned with Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline LLC (MNE) on PNGTS (Joint Facilities), are operated by 
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     17


subsidiaries of TC Energy. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The Joint Facilities are operated by M&N Operating Company, LLC (MNOC),a subsidiary of MNE. MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc. Our pipeline systems include:

Pipeline | Length | Description | Ownership

The map below shows the location of our pipeline systems.
Customers, Contracting and Demand
Our customers are generally large utilities, Local Distribution Companies (LDCs), major natural gas marketers, producing companies and other interstate pipelines, including affiliates. Our systems generate revenue by charging rates for transporting natural gas. Natural gas transportation service is provided pursuant to long-term and short-term contracts on a firm or interruptible basis. The majority of our pipeline systems' natural gas transportation services are provided through firm service transportation contracts with a reservation or demand charge that reserves pipeline capacity, regardless of use, for the term of the contract. The revenues associated with capacity reserved under firm service transportation contracts are not subject to 
18     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


fluctuations caused by changing supply and demand conditions, competition or customers. Customers with interruptible service transportation agreements may utilize available capacity after firm service transportation requests are satisfied.
Our pipeline systems actively market their available capacity and work closely with customers, including natural gas producers, LDCs, marketers and end users, to ensure our pipelines are offering attractive services and competitive rates. Approximately 74 percent of our long-term contract revenues are with customers who have an investment grade rating or who have provided guarantees from investment grade parties. We have obtained financial assurances as permitted by FERC and our tariffs for the remaining long-term contracts. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Transactions with our major customers that are at least 10 percent of our consolidated revenues can be found under Note 16-Transactions with major customers within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules," which information is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, our equity investee Great Lakes earns a significant portion of its revenue from TC Energy and its affiliates as disclosed under Note 17-Related party transactions within Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,” which information is incorporated herein by reference.
GTN – GTN’s revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts through the end of 2023 with its remaining contracts extending between 2024 and 2045. These contracts, which have historically been renewed on a long-term basis upon expiration, are primarily held by residential and commercial LDCs and power generators that use a diversified portfolio of transportation options to serve their long-term markets and marketers under a variety of contract terms. A portion of GTN's contract portfolio is contracted by industrial shippers and producers. We expect GTN to continue to be an important transportation component of these diversified portfolios. Incremental transportation opportunities are based on the difference in value between Western Canadian natural gas supplies and deliveries to Northern California.
Upstream debottlenecking on TC Energy's NGTL System, which delivers natural gas to GTN, has allowed GTN to sign over 700,000 Dth/day in long-term contracts with in-service dates between 2018 and 2020. The majority of these contracts have terms of at least 15 years.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced the GTN XPress Project, the largest organic growth opportunity in the Partnership's 20-year history. This project includes a horsepower replacement program and a brownfield expansion. The reliability work will enable increased firm natural gas transportation on GTN, which together with the growth component of the project, will sum to 250,000 Dth/d in additional long-term contracts on the pipeline system. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects Update” for more information.
In early 2019, GTN’s largest customer, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pacific Gas), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On July 1, 2020, Pacific Gas emerged from its bankruptcy proceedings. Pacific Gas accounted for approximately seven percent of the Partnership’s consolidated revenues in 2020 (2019 - seven percent). As a utility company, Pacific Gas serves residential and industrial customers in the state of California and has an ongoing obligation to serve its customers. We have not experienced collection issues to date and expect this to continue going forward. 
Northern Border – Northern Border is a highly competitive pipeline system with a weighted average remaining contract length of approximately 5 years. Northern Border contracts that include renewal rights and expiring contracts have typically been renewed for terms of five years. A significant portion of Northern Border’s contract portfolio is contracted by utilities, marketers and industrial load. In addition, Northern Border sells seasonal transportation services which have traditionally been strongest during peak winter months to serve heating demand and peak spring/summer months to serve electric cooling demand and storage injection.
Great Lakes – Great Lakes' revenue is derived from both short-haul and long-haul transportation services. The majority of its contracts are with TC Energy and affiliates on multiple paths across its system. Great Lakes' ability to sell its available and future capacity will depend on future market conditions which are impacted by a number of factors including weather, levels of natural gas in storage, the capacity of upstream and downstream pipelines and the availability and pricing of natural gas supplies. Demand for Great Lakes' services has historically been highest in the summer to fill the natural gas storage complexes in Ontario and Michigan in advance of the upcoming winter season. During the winter, Great Lakes serves peak heating requirements for customers in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and the upper Midwest of the U.S.
A significant portion of Great Lakes’ total contract portfolio is contracted by its affiliates including its long-term transportation agreement with TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline that commenced on November 1, 2017 for a ten-year period that allows TC Energy to transport up to about 0.711 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day on the Great Lakes system. This contract was a direct benefit from TC Energy’s long-term fixed price service on its Canadian Mainline that was launched in 2017. TC Energy’s long-term fixed price service provides long-term capacity to TC Energy’s shippers for the transportation of WCSB natural gas to markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Other Business Developments” for more information.
In early 2020, TC Energy approved the Alberta XPress Project, an expansion project on its ANR Pipeline system with an estimated in-service date of 2022. This project utilizes existing aggregate capacity on Great Lakes System of approximately 168,000 Dth/day for a term of 20 years at maximum rates for a total contract value of $182 million starting in 2022.
This contract, which has a full quantity reduction option at any time before October 1, 2022, is dependent on ANR's ability to secure the required regulatory approvals and other requirements of the project associated with these volumes. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments- Growth Projects Update” for more information.
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     19


PNGTS – PNGTS’ revenues are primarily generated from transportation agreements with LDCs throughout New England and Canada’s Atlantic provinces. The majority of PNGTS’ current revenue stream is supported by long-term contracts entered into via a series of open seasons for long-term capacity held by PNGTS in recent years. Long-term contracts with several shippers involving commitments of approximately 82,000 Dth/day from PNGTS’ Continent-to-Coast Contracts for a term of 15 years (the C2C Contracts) began December 1, 2017, necessitating an increase in PNGTS’ certificated capacity up to approximately 210,000 Dth/day. The C2C Contracts mature in 2032.
In addition to the C2C Contracts, in 2017, as a result of its PXP open season, PNGTS executed 20-year precedent agreements with several LDCs in New England and Atlantic Canada to re-contract certain system capacity set to expire in 2019 as well as expand the PNGTS system. PXP Phases I, II and III were placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The total final volume of the project is approximately 183,000 Dth/day: 40,000 Dth/day from Phase I, 118,400 Dth/day from Phase II, which includes re-contracting and renewal of expiring contracts, and 24,600 Dth/day from Phase III. PXP, together with the C2C expansion brings additional, natural gas supply options to markets in New England and Atlantic Canada in response to the growing need for natural gas transportation capacity in the region.
PXP is fully subscribed with no uncontracted firm capacity to meet incremental market demand in this region. In response, PNGTS developed a second expansion project. In early 2019, PNGTS announced the Westbrook XPress Project which is an independent project that is designed to be phased in over a four-year period beginning November 1, 2019 with Phase I. Phases II and III have estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and 2022, respectively. Westbrook XPress will add incremental capacity for Phases I, II and III of approximately 43,000 Dth/day, 69,000 Dth/day, and 18,000 Dth/day, respectively. Westbrook XPress, together with PXP, will increase PNGTS’ capacity by 90 percent from 210,000 Dth/day to approximately 400,000 Dth/day. The Westbrook XPress contracts expire between 2036 and 2042. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects Update” for more information about PXP and Westbrook XPress.
Iroquois – Iroquois transports natural gas under long-term contracts that expire between 2021 and 2032 and extends from TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline system at the U.S. border near Waddington, New York to markets in the U.S. northeast, including New York City, Long Island and Connecticut. Iroquois provides service to local gas distribution companies, electric utilities and electric power generators, as well as marketers and other end users, directly or indirectly, through interconnecting pipelines and exchanges throughout the northeastern U.S. Iroquois also earns discretionary transportation service revenues which can have a significant earnings impact. Discretionary transportation service revenues include short-term firm transportation service contracts with less than one-year terms as well as standard interruptible transportation service contracts. In 2020, Iroquois earned approximately 12 percent of its revenues from discretionary services.
During the second quarter of 2019, Iroquois initiated the ExC Project to meet current and future gas supply needs of utility customers by upgrading its compressor stations along the pipeline. This project will be 100 percent underpinned with 20-year contracts and is subject to the receipt of necessary permits and approvals. This project has an estimated in-service date of November 2023. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects Update” for more information.
North Baja – The North Baja pipeline system is an 86-mile bi-directional natural gas pipeline transporting gas between Arizona, California and the Mexican border since 2002. North Baja’s historical steady financial performance is due to its strong contracting levels, having a weighted average remaining firm contract length of about 7 years. North Baja currently has a design capacity of 500 mcf/d of southbound transportation and is capable of transporting 600 mcf/d in a northbound direction.
In April 2019, we concluded a successful binding open season for North Baja XPress Project to transport approximately 495,000 Dth/day of additional volumes of natural gas along North Baja’s mainline system between Arizona and California. The estimated in-service date of the project is February 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other requirements of the project. See Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments-Growth Projects Update” for more information.
Bison – As previously disclosed, natural gas is not flowing on the Bison system in response to the recent relative cost advantage of WCSB and Bakken sourced gas versus Rockies production. From its in-service date in 2011 up to the fourth quarter of 2018, Bison was fully contracted on a ship-or-pay basis. During the fourth quarter of 2018, through a Permanent Capacity Release Agreement, Tenaska Marketing Ventures (Tenaska) assumed Anadarko Energy Services Company’s (Anadarko) ship-or-pay contract obligation on Bison, the largest contract on Bison. After assuming the transportation obligation, Bison accepted an offer from Tenaska to terminate this contract. Following the amendment of its tariff to enable this transaction, another customer executed a similar agreement to terminate its contract on Bison. At the completion of the contracts, Bison was released from performing any future services with the two customers and as such, the amounts received were recorded in revenue in 2018.
The two customers represented approximately 60 percent of Bison’s revenue in 2018 and accordingly, in 2019 and 2020, Bison’s revenue was reduced by approximately $47 million and $49 million, respectively, in comparison to 2018 revenues when Bison was fully contracted. Its remaining contracts in the system expire in January 2021. 
Based on this development and other qualitative factors, the Partnership evaluated the remaining carrying value of Bison’s property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2018 and concluded that the entire amount was no longer recoverable, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to explore alternative transportation-related options for Bison and we believe commercial potential exists to allow natural gas transported on Bison to flow in both directions, with the southwest direction involving deliveries onto third party pipelines and ultimately connecting into the Cheyenne hub. In any event, Bison will continue to incur costs related to property tax and operating and maintenance costs of approximately $6 million per year. See also Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates” for more information.

Tuscarora – Tuscarora’s revenues are substantially supported by long-term contracts with a weighted average remaining contract length of approximately 5 years. We expect Tuscarora to continue be fully contracted on a long-term basis when its current contracts expire.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced that we are proceeding with the Tuscarora XPress Project, which is an estimated $13 million expansion project through additional compression capability at an existing Tuscarora facility. Tuscarora XPress is 100 percent underpinned by a 20-year contract and will transport approximately 15,000 Dth/day of additional volumes when completed in November 2021. Tuscarora XPress is expected to generate approximately $2 million in revenue on an annualized basis when fully in service.
Competition
Overall, our pipeline systems generate a substantial portion of their cash flow from long-term firm contracts for transportation services and are therefore insulated from competitive factors during the terms of the contracts. If these long-term contracts are not renewed at their expiration, our pipeline systems face competitive pressures which influence contract renewals and rates charged for transportation services.
GTN and Northern Border, through their respective connections with TC Energy's Foothills systems, and Great Lakes and Iroquois, through their respective connections with TC Energy's Canadian Mainline, compete with each other for WCSB natural gas supply as well as with other pipelines, including the Alliance pipeline and the Westcoast pipeline. Northern Border and Great Lakes compete in their respective market areas for natural gas supplies from other basins as well, such as the Bakken, Rocky Mountain area, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, Utica and Marcellus basins. GTN primarily competes with pipelines supplying natural gas into California and Pacific Northwest markets.
Bison competes for deliveries with other pipelines that transport natural gas supplies within and away from the Rocky Mountain area, and gas from the Rocky Mountains that is delivered into the Midwest must compete with gas sourced from the Bakken and Western Canada.
North Baja’s southbound pipeline capacity competes with deliveries of LNG received at the Costa Azul terminal in Mexico. If LNG shipments are received at Costa Azul, North Baja’s northbound capacity competes with pipelines that deliver Rocky Mountain area, Permian and San Juan basin natural gas into the southern California area.
Tuscarora competes for deliveries primarily into the northern Nevada natural gas market with natural gas from the Rocky Mountain area.
PNGTS connects with the TQM pipeline at the Canadian border and shares facilities with the MNE from Westbrook, Maine to a connection with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline System near Boston, Massachusetts. PNGTS competes with LNG supplies and gas flows from Canada and with LNG delivered into Boston. Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Algonquin Gas Transmission also compete with PNGTS for gas deliveries into New England markets.
As noted above, Iroquois, through its connection with TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline System, competes for WCSB natural gas supply with other pipelines. Iroquois connects at five locations with three interstate pipelines (Tennessee Gas, CNG Gas Transmission and Algonquin Gas Transmission) and TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline System near Waddington, New York and provides a link between WCSB natural gas deliveries to markets in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island.
Additionally, our pipeline assets face competition from other pipeline companies seeking opportunities to invest in greenfield natural gas pipeline development opportunities. This competition could result in fewer projects being available that meet our pipeline systems’ investment hurdles or projects that proceed with lower overall financial returns.
Relationship with TC Energy
TC Energy is the indirect parent of our General Partner and at December 31, 2020, owns, through its subsidiaries, approximately 24 percent of our common units, 100 percent of our Class B units, 100 percent of our IDRs and has a two percent general partner interest in us. TC Energy is a major energy infrastructure company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE, with more than 65 years of experience in the responsible development and reliable operation of energy infrastructure in North America. TC Energy’s business is primarily focused on natural gas and liquids transmission and power generation services, delivering the energy millions of people rely on to power their lives in a sustainable way. TC Energy consists of investments in approximately 58,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, approximately 3,000 miles of liquids pipelines and 535 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. TC Energy also owns or has interests in approximately 4,200 megawatts of power generation. TC Energy operates most of our pipeline systems and, in some cases, contracts for pipeline capacity.
On December 14, 2020 the Partnership, the General Partner, TC Energy, TC Northern, TC PipeLine USA, and Merger Sub, entered into the TC Energy Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the TC Energy Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership continuing as the sole surviving entity and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the TC Energy Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the TC Energy Merger, each common unit representing a fractional part of the limited partner interests in the Partnership issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the TC Energy Merger, other than common units owned by TC Energy and its affiliates, 
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     21


will be cancelled in exchange for 0.70 shares of TC Energy common shares. See also Part I, Item 1. “Business- Recent Business Developments - Planned Merger with TC Energy" for more information on our Merger Agreement with TC Energy.
Government Regulation
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
All of our pipeline systems are regulated by FERC under the NGA and Energy Policy Act of 2005, which gives FERC jurisdiction to regulate effectively all aspects of our business, including:
•transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce;
•rates and charges;
•terms of service and service contracts with customers, including counterparty credit support requirements;
•certification and construction of new facilities;
•extension or abandonment of service and facilities;
•accounts and records;
•depreciation and amortization policies;
•acquisition and disposition of facilities;
•initiation and discontinuation of services; and
•standards of conduct for business relations with certain affiliates.
Our pipeline systems’ operating revenues are determined based on rate options stated in our tariffs which are approved by FERC. Tariffs specify the general terms and conditions for pipeline transportation service including the rates that may be charged. FERC, either through hearing a rate case or as a result of approving a negotiated rate settlement, approves the maximum rates permissible for transportation service on a pipeline system which are designed to recover the pipeline’s cost-based investment, operating expenses and a reasonable return for its investors. Once maximum rates are set, a pipeline system is not permitted to adjust the maximum rates to reflect changes in costs or contract demand until new rates are approved by FERC. Pipelines are permitted to charge rates lower than the maximum tariff rates in order to compete. As a result, earnings and cash flows of each pipeline system depend on a number of factors including costs incurred, contracted capacity and transportation path, the volume of natural gas transported, and rates charged.
2018 FERC Actions
Background:
During the latter part of 2018, the Partnership completed its regulatory filings to address the issues contemplated by Public Law No. 115-97, commonly known as the 2017 Tax Act and certain FERC actions that began in March of 2018, namely FERC’s Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) and a Final Rule that established a schedule by which interstate pipelines must either (i) file a new uncontested rate settlement or (ii) file a one-time report, called FERC Form No. 501-G, that quantified the rate impact of the 2017 Tax Act on FERC-regulated pipelines and the impact of the Revised Policy Statement on pipelines held by MLPs (collectively, the 2018 FERC Actions).
Impact of the 2018 FERC Actions to the Partnership:
The 2018 FERC Actions directly addressed two components of our pipeline systems’ cost-of-service based rates: the allowance for income taxes and the inclusion of ADIT in their rate base. The 2018 FERC Actions also noted that precise treatment of entities with more ambiguous ownership structures must be separately resolved on a case-by-case basis, such as those partially owned by corporations including Great Lakes, Northern Border, Iroquois and PNGTS. Additionally, any FERC-mandated rate reduction did not affect negotiated rate contracts. Prior to the 2018 FERC Actions, none of the Partnership’s pipeline systems had a requirement to file or adjust their rates earlier than 2022 as a result of their existing rate settlements. However, several of our pipeline systems accelerated such adjustments as a result of the 2018 FERC Actions. The resulting impact from the actions taken by our pipelines to address the 2018 FERC Actions requirements are outlined below:
22     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020



 | 2018 FERC Actions Impact on Maximum Rates | Moratorium, MandatoryFiling Requirements andOther Considerations 
Great Lakes | 2.0% rate reduction effective February 1, 2019 | No moratorium in effect; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by October 1, 2022 
GTN | A refund of $10 million to its firm customers in 2018; 10.0% rate reduction effective January 1, 2019; additional rate reduction of 6.6% effective January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021; these reductions will replace the 8.3% rate reduction in 2020 agreed to as part of the last settlement in 2015 | Moratorium on rate changes until December 31, 2021; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by January 1, 2022; Settlement agreement reflected an elimination of income tax allowance and ADIT
Northern Border | 2.0% rate reduction effective February 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 extended until July 1, 2024 unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement | No moratorium in effect; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by July 1, 2024 
Bison | No rate changes proposed | No moratorium or comeback provisions 
Iroquois | 3.25% rate reduction effective March 1, 2019; additional 3.25% rate reduction effective April 1, 2020 | Moratorium on rate changes until September 1, 2020; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by March 1, 2023 
PNGTS | No rate changes | No moratorium or comeback provisions 
North Baja | 10.8% rate reduction effective December 1, 2018 | No moratorium or comeback provisions; approximately 90 percent of North Baja’s contracts are negotiated; 10.8% reduction is on maximum rate contracts only 
Tuscarora | 1.7% rate reduction effective February 1, 2019; additional rate reduction of 10.8% effective August 1, 2019 | Moratorium on rate changes until January 31, 2023; comeback provision with new rates to be effective by February 1, 2023; Settlement agreement reflected an elimination of income tax allowance and ADIT

The Final Rule allowed pipelines owned by MLPs and other pass through entities to remove the ADIT liability from their rate bases, and thus increase the net recoverable rate base, partially or in some cases wholly mitigated the loss of the tax allowance in cost-of-service based rates. Following the elimination of the tax allowance and the ADIT liability from rate base, rate settlements and related filings of all pipelines held wholly or in part by the Partnership summarized above, the estimated impact of the tax-related changes to our revenue and cash flow is a reduction of approximately $30 million per year on an annualized basis beginning in 2019.
In 2019 and 2020, the estimated impact of the tax-related changes to our revenue and cashflow have been largely mitigated by additional revenue generated from continued strong natural gas flows mainly out of WCSB and from solid contracting levels across the Partnership pipeline assets. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
Existing rate settlements:
GTN – On October 16, 2018, GTN filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the changes proposed by the 2018 FERC Actions on its rates via an amendment to its prior 2015 settlement (the 2018 GTN Settlement). The 2018 GTN Settlement reflects an elimination of the tax allowance previously recovered in rates along with ADIT for rate-making purposes (see details of the 2018 GTN Settlement in the table above).
Tuscarora – On March 15, 2019, Tuscarora filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the issues contemplated by the 2017 Tax Act and 2018 FERC Actions via an amendment to its prior 2016 settlement (the 2019 Tuscarora Settlement).
Among the terms of the 2019 Tuscarora Settlement, Tuscarora agreed to reduce its existing maximum system rates by 1.7 percent effective February 1, 2019 through to July 31, 2019, followed by an additional decrease of 10.8 percent for the period August 1, 2019 through the term of the settlement. Tuscarora is required to have new rates in effect on February 1, 2023. Tuscarora and its customers also agreed on a moratorium on rate changes until January 31, 2023. The 2019 Tuscarora Settlement, which was approved by FERC on May 2, 2019, will also reflect an elimination of the tax allowance previously recovered in rates along with ADIT for rate-making purposes.
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     23


Iroquois – On February 28, 2019, Iroquois filed an uncontested settlement with FERC to address the issues contemplated by the 2017 Tax Act and 2018 FERC Actions via an amendment to its prior 2016 settlement (the 2019 Iroquois Settlement). Among the terms of the 2019 Iroquois Settlement, Iroquois agreed to reduce its existing maximum system rates by 6.5 percent to be implemented in two phases, (i) effective March 1, 2019, a 3.25 percent rate reduction and (ii) effective April 1, 2020, an additional 3.25 percent rate reduction, which will conclude the total 6.5 percent rate reduction from the 2016 settlement rates. The 2019 Iroquois Settlement, which was approved by FERC on May 2, 2019, preserved the 2016 settlement moratorium on further rate changes until September 1, 2020. Unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement, Iroquois will be required to have new rates in effect by March 1, 2023.
Great Lakes – Great Lakes operates under a settlement approved by FERC effective January 1, 2018 (the 2017 Great Lakes Settlement). The 2017 Great Lakes Settlement did not contain a moratorium and eliminated its revenue sharing mechanism with customers. Great Lakes is required to file new rates effective October 1, 2022. Effective February 1, 2019, FERC approved an additional 2 percent rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to Great Lakes’ limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and mitigated the loss of Great Lakes’ tax allowance.
Northern Border – Northern Border operates under a settlement approved by FERC effective January 1, 2018 (the 2017 Northern Border Settlement). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement provided for tiered rate reductions from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 that equate to an overall rate reduction of 12.5 percent when compared to 2017 rates by January 1, 2020 (10.5 percent by December 31, 2019 and additional two percent by January 1, 2020). The 2017 Northern Border Settlement did not contain a moratorium and Northern Border is required to file new rates effective July 1, 2024. Effective February 1, 2019, FERC approved an additional two percent rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to Northern Border’s limited NGA Section 4 filing. On April 4, 2019, Northern Border filed an amended settlement agreement that extended the two percent rate reduction implemented on February 1, 2019 to July 1, 2024 effective January 1, 2020 unless superseded by a subsequent rate case or settlement. On May 24, 2019, FERC approved the amended settlement agreement and Northern Border’s 501-G proceeding was terminated. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and mitigated the loss of Northern Border’s tax allowance.
Bison – Bison operates under the rates approved by FERC in connection with Bison's initial construction and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding.
North Baja – North Baja operates under the rates approved by FERC in its original certificate proceeding in 2001 and has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding. Effective December 1, 2019, FERC approved a 10.8 percent rate reduction and elimination of its tax allowance and ADIT liability from rate base pursuant to North Baja’s limited NGA Section 4 filing. The removal of ADIT increased net recoverable rate base and partially mitigated the loss of North Baja’s tax allowance.
PNGTS – PNGTS operates under the rates approved by FERC in PNGTS’ most recent rate proceeding, effective December 1, 2010. PNGTS has no requirement to file a new rate proceeding.
Policy Statement on Return on Equity 
FERC issued a Policy Statement on May 21, 2020, regarding the determination of the return on equity (ROE) to be used in designing natural gas and oil pipeline rates. In the Policy Statement, FERC determined that its analysis of the ROE component of a pipeline’s rates should be determined by averaging the results of the Discounted Cash Flow model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model. FERC determined that it will not use the Risk Premium Model. Our pipelines are subject to rate regulation by FERC and any future rate cases we file are subject to the determinations in this Policy Statement. We do not expect changes in this policy to affect us in a materially different manner than other similarly sized natural gas pipeline companies operating in the United States.
NOI on Certificate Policy Statement
FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 (Certificate Policy Statement NOI), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the Certificate Policy Statement NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. No further action has occurred since the Certificate Policy Statement NOI was issued. We do not expect changes in this policy to affect us in a materially different manner than other similarly sized natural gas pipeline companies operating in the United States.
Environmental Matters
Our assets are subject to a variety of stringent U.S. federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, biodiversity, wastewater discharges, waste management, water management, and water quality. These laws and regulations generally require natural gas pipeline companies to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental registrations, 
24     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


licenses, permits and other authorizations required for construction and operations. Consequences of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, or authorizations include, but are not limited to, the following: administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties; imposition of investigatory, remedial, and/or corrective actions; delay in obtaining necessary authorizations; denial or termination of project authorizations; imposition of restrictions or limitations on project authorizations; addition or removal of conditions or terms in project authorizations; and/or the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting operations or construction. Violations of certain environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of strict, joint and several liability.
Federal Environmental Laws and Regulations
Federal environmental laws, and their related regulations, each as amended from time to time, that most significantly impact our pipeline operations include:
•the Clean Air Act (CAA), which regulates air pollution on a national level by restricting the emission of air pollutants from various stationary and mobile sources and imposes an array of pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements. The CAA authorizes the EPA to adopt climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
•the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities into state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS);
•the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in WOTUS;
•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;
•the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which governs the production, importation, use and disposal of specific chemicals and provides the EPA with authority to require reporting, record-keeping and testing requirements, and restrictions relating to chemical substances and mixtures, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, radon, and lead-based paint;
•the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories;
•the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats by the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; and
•the NEPA, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental effects of major agency actions and prepare environmental assessments (EAs) or more detailed environmental impact statements (EISs) that may be made available for public review and comment.
Regional, State, Tribal, and Local Environmental Laws and Regulations
In addition to the numerous environmental laws and regulations at the federal level, there exist regional, state, tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations that sometimes make permitting, development, or expansion of certain projects more extensive and complex. For example, some of our projects may require the acquisition of permits from more than one level of government. Additionally, regional, state, tribal, or local laws and regulations may be more stringent than their federal counterparts. The existence of environmental laws at various levels of government also provide more opportunities for citizens’ suits or other forms of opposition to new developmental projects or the expansion of existing projects. These factors all have the potential to substantially restrict or delay project permitting, development, or expansion of projects and increase costs to gas pipeline companies, including the Partnership, in the process.
Judicial Decisions, Enforcement Policies, Executive Actions 
In addition to the adoption and implementation of federal and state environmental laws and regulations, judicial decisions interpreting those laws and regulations, enforcement policies as well as the issuance of executive actions at all levels of government can also significantly increase operational or compliance costs for gas pipeline companies. Uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of certain laws and regulations due to conflicting rulings on environmental issues in a given court system may be an added burden on operations and compliance-related decision-making.
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     25


Notably, President Biden issued several executive orders on his first day in office on January 20, 2021, including an Executive Order (EO) for Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis. The EO directs agencies to review agency actions promulgated, issued, or adopted between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, for consistency with the public health and environmental protection policy goals of the EO. If inconsistent, the EO directs agencies to consider suspending, revising, or rescinding the agency actions. Several federal environmental regulations of interest to our business, and which are discussed in this section, are subject to review under the EO, including the Navigable Waters Protection Rule and air/GHG emissions regulations. Specifically, the EO directed EPA to review its recent methane technical amendment to the NSPS for stationary sources and to propose revisions to existing source standards by September 2021. 
The new Administration’s chief of staff also issued a memorandum regarding a Regulatory Freeze Pending Review on January 20, 2021, to the heads of executive departments and agencies. Notably, the regulatory freeze asks department and agency heads to consider postponing the effective date of rules which have already been published in the Federal Register, and subsequently opening a comment period and reconsidering the rule as needed. The USACE’s reissuance of the NWPs and the USFWS’s new MBTA rule are subject to reconsideration under this memorandum. 
Notable Water-Related Environmental Developments Potentially Impacting the Partnership 
While constructing, maintaining, repairing, and/or replacing pipelines and related facilities, there may be a discharge of pollutants and/or dredged or fill material into WOTUS. Such activities are regulated under the CWA and may require special authorization from the EPA, USACE and/or States such as a CWA Section 401 water quality certification, CWA Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and/or a CWA Section 404 permit for discharge of dredge or fill material, such as Nationwide Permit (NWP) 12. In 2020, the CWA was in the national spotlight with numerous high-profile regulatory actions and litigation related to the definition of WOTUS (the scope of waters federally regulated under the CWA), CWA Section 404’s NWP program, and the CWA Section 401 water quality certification process. The reversal in whole or in part of any of these regulatory actions may have a material impact on the Partnership’s business through, for example, increased compliance-related costs, project permitting delays, and more. 
The Navigable Waters Protection Rule, issued under former President Trump’s administration and the most recent regulation defining the scope of waters under CWA jurisdiction, WOTUS, became effective on June 22, 2020. This rule replaces the 2015 Clean Water Rule issued under former President Obama’s administration by narrowing the definition of WOTUS and significantly reducing the number of federally regulated bodies of water. The expansion and narrowing of the definition of WOTUS has been a controversial and longstanding issue. A narrowing of the definition is favorable for the pipeline industry since it reduces the number of pipeline projects subject to burdensome and costly CWA regulation and permitting programs by limiting affected waters subject to protection under the CWA. This rule is currently being challenged in high profile cases in federal courts throughout the country. While the new rule is favorable to our industry, it’s tenure may be curtailed if there are successful court challenges and President Biden's administration, with its robust environmental protection agenda, chooses to again expand the definition of WOTUS through rulemaking. 
While constructing, maintaining, repairing, and/or replacing our pipelines and related facilities, our activities may discharge dredged or fill material into WOTUS and, in effect, may require a USACE CWA Section 404 individual or general permit. NWPs are general permits issued by USACE to streamline the authorization of activities that result in no more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse environmental effects. If the environmental impact is not minimal, the regulated community may need to apply for the more time-consuming and burdensome individual permits that evaluate discharge activities on a case-by-case basis. Historically, NWP 12 has been specifically used by utilities, including oil and gas pipelines, telecommunications lines, sewage lines, water lines, and more. The CWA Section 404 NWP Program has been under the national spotlight since April 15, 2020, when a Montana federal District Court ruled against TC Energy’s use of an allegedly invalid NWP 12 for its Keystone XL project and enjoining the USACE from issuing NWP 12s for utility activities nationwide. The Court believed the USACE violated the ESA when it renewed NWP 12 in 2017 and remanded NWP 12 back to the USACE to remedy the identified issue. The U.S. Supreme Court granted an emergency stay of the district court’s order, except as it applied to Keystone XL, while the decision’s merits were being appealed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by the federal defendants. This ongoing litigation has created tremendous uncertainty within the pipeline industry regarding the scope of pipeline activities still allowed to use NWP 12 and concern over the potential material, long-term harms to pipeline projects throughout the country if the appeal of the district court’s order in the Ninth Circuit is unsuccessful. In response to the uncertainty, many pipeline companies, including ourselves, had to reconsider permitting strategies for projects that were depending on the use of NWP 12. For example, companies have incurred additional costs and project delays by switching to alternative nationwide permits or the significantly more time-consuming individual permits. In some cases, companies have had to assume some risk in continuing to use NWP 12, particularly for those projects already in the construction phase. Other pipeline companies have also been challenged in federal courts throughout the country on similar NWP 12 grounds, indicating an increasing litigation risk to the Partnership’s continued use of NWP 12, and potentially other NWPs. 
After the Keystone XL NWP 12 District Court decision, the USACE began rulemaking to reissue or renew the 2017 NWPs, including NWP 12, which are set to expire in 2022. On January 13, 2021, a final rule was published reissuing and modifying 12 of the existing NWPs, including NWP 12, and issuing four new NWPs. The rulemaking notably did not remedy the District Court’s identified ESA non-compliance that was central to the legal dispute. The reissuance also included a restructured NWP 12 that separated utilities covered under the permit into three NWPs, with the more contentious oil and gas pipelines isolated from the rest. 
26     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


The rule is effective March 15, 2021. Under President Biden's administration, the NWP reissuance rulemaking and the underlying issues in the Keystone XL NWP 12 litigation may be reconsidered in an unfavorable manner to the oil and gas pipeline industry. Additionally, the NWP reissuance may be subject to the regulatory freeze pending the review described in the Biden Administration’s January 20, 2021 memorandum. With uncertainty surrounding the use of NWP 12 for pipeline projects nationwide, particularly growth projects, the Partnership may be materially affected by experiencing project permitting delays and increased vulnerability to lawsuits. However, TC Energy continues to explore creative permitting strategies to minimize and mitigate the additional risks posed by the current regulatory uncertainty. 
Furthermore, the EPA’s final rule amending regulations implementing Section 401 of the CWA, which requires states and/or authorized tribes to grant, deny, or waive a water quality certification for major federal licenses and permits, became effective on September 11, 2020. The new rule clarifies various aspects of the current Section 401 regulations, and notably narrows the scope of state and tribal review to preclude them from considering issues other than water quality in their certifications of permits and to curtail delays in decision-making. This rule is very beneficial for the permitting of our pipeline projects but is another such rule that, as expected, is being challenged heavily in court. It is imperative that the Section 401 certification process not cause additional uncertainty and delays that may cause additional material compliance costs to the Partnership and make execution of our various projects more difficult. The success of this final rule is important for our business and is something that will continue to be monitored so that the extent of the impacts to our business can be better understood. 
Notable Species-Related Environmental Developments Potentially Impacting the Partnership – Environment (Species)
In 2020, the USFWS developed a rule which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the MBTA will apply only to actions “directed at” migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs and not lawful activities, such as pipeline facility construction, maintenance, repair, and related activities, which inadvertently result in the “incidental take” of migratory birds. This controversial rulemaking is very beneficial to pipeline companies, including the Partnership, since it reduces regulatory burdens, pipeline construction complications and obstacles, and mitigates criminal liability from construction activities which unintentionally impact migratory birds. The rule was finalized in December 2020 and will be effective February 8, 2021. However, it is one of the agency actions that may be subject to the regulatory freeze pending the review described in President Biden's Administration’s January 20, 2021 memorandum. The Partnership may be materially affected if the administration reverts back to the original interpretation that incidental take is not free of liability, in addition to expanding the lists of protected threatened and endangered wildlife and plants under the ESA. Additionally, in December 2020, former President Trump's administration finalized two noteworthy ESA rules. In one rule, the USFWS and NMFS established a definition for “habitat” for the sole purpose of designating critical habitat. In another rule, the USFWS identified several factors that may be considered when determining whether to exclude certain lands from critical habitat designations, including economic impacts. The latter rule allows an area to be excluded from critical habitat designation if the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion for that area (as long as the exclusion does not cause species extinction). While this rule is favorable to industry, particularly pipeline companies, it is also expected to be reconsidered by President Biden's administration. 
Notable Air-Related Environmental Developments Potentially Impacting the Partnership 
Federal and State non-GHG Air Pollutant Regulations 
In 2020, the EPA, under former President Trump's administration proposed and promulgated several air-related rules under the federal CAA that were met with significant opposition from environmental advocacy groups as well as state and local governments. For example, the EPA made the controversial decision in 2020 to retain, without revision the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground level Ozone and Particulate Matter, that were established in 2015 by former President Obama's administration. The decision to not make these standards more stringent were highly criticized by environmental advocacy groups as well as state and local governments and are currently being challenged in federal court. President Biden's administration is likely to reconsider the rulemaking and could make the standards more stringent. There was similar opposition to EPA’s November 2020 withdrawal of the “Once in Always in” policy requiring sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that were once considered a “major source” of HAPs to be subject to the more stringent emissions standards even if the source reduces its emissions below the “major source” threshold later. These EPA actions are very beneficial to industry since they reduce our regulatory burdens and compliance-related costs, however the rules, in their current form, may not be permanent with the pending litigation challenging the rules and President Biden's aggressive climate protection agenda. These air regulations are subject to review under the January 20, 2021 EO. 
Furthermore, the State of Oregon’s development and implementation of its 2021 air quality protection plan in furtherance of the federal Regional Haze Rule may have a material impact on the Partnership. The EPA’s Regional Haze Rule requires states to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness within their jurisdictions by identifying sources of emissions and reasonable control methods to improve visibility. In the development phase of its state plan, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) has identified two GTN stations with turbines that may require GTN to incur material capital expenditures related to installation of emissions controls under the final state plan.
Federal Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Regulation
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the U.S. and throughout the globe. The spotlight on GHG regulation as a means to combat climate change is expected to continue to increase compliance, construction, and operating costs for pipeline companies, including the Partnership, particularly under President Biden's aggressive climate change 
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     27


agenda, which included the issuance of a slate of executive orders within his first week in office demonstrating an unprecedented commitment to climate policy. Federal, state and local governments are using tools like executive orders, legislation, regulatory actions, and more to regulate GHGs. At the federal level, for example, EPA has promulgated regulations requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs and limiting GHGs directly from certain sources of emissions. Governmental, scientific, and public concern over GHG emissions from the oil and gas industry, in particular, is growing considerably. President Biden’s new executive orders included a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, a revocation of the Keystone XL Presidential Permit, and more. Furthermore, while the EPA has historically been the sole federal regulator of GHGs, on December 27, 2020, former President Trump signed into law the 2020 PIPES Act, which notably made PHMSA another federal regulator of methane emissions from pipeline facilities. While we cannot predict the extent of the impact on the Partnership and the rest of the oil and gas industry from the increased GHG regulation, we can be sure that it will be material. 
In recent years, there has been a particular focus on the regulation of the specific GHG, methane. Methane is the primary component of the natural gas flowing through our pipelines and is sometimes release into the atmosphere through pipeline leaks and blowdowns during pipeline maintenance, repair, testing, and other such activities. Natural gas companies and trade organizations are proactively evaluating the impact of methane to the climate crisis, approaches to measuring methane releases more accurately, and methane leak monitoring, reporting, detection, and mitigation practices and available technology. This research and analysis is not only important to understanding how to cost-effectively comply with the ever-increasing regulation of methane, but also to prove to fossil fuel opponents that the value of natural gas far outweigh the impact on climate. 
Since the climate crisis is now regularly used to challenge the construction of natural gas pipeline projects, anytime methane regulations were relaxed under former President Trump's administration, particularly for the oil and gas industry, they were swiftly challenged in court, including a notable methane regulation in 2020. On August 13, 2020, the EPA, under former President Trump's administration issued policy and technical amendments to the NSPS, for stationary sources of air emissions. The policy amendments, (Methane Policy Rule), effective September 14, 2020, notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and VOC requirements for the remaining sources that were established by former President Obama's administration. The technical amendment included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules for gathering and boosting compressor stations and low-production wells, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and more. The Partnership sees the amendments as positive for the industry since it eliminates NSPS for natural gas transmission pipelines. However, it is important to note that the Partnership is still committed to many of the NSPS requirements for pipelines. This is important because, as expected, the amendments were immediately challenged in federal court. Moreover, President Biden's January 20, 2021 EO for Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis specifically directed EPA to review the technical amendment by September 2021. A reconsideration of the more controversial policy amendment is expected to follow. The same EO directed EPA to also propose existing source standards by September 2021. The extent to which these directives will impact the Partnership remains unknown. 
State GHG Regulation
In the absence of consistency and predictability in GHG emissions legislation, regulation and policies at the federal level, state and local governments have increasingly and more aggressively pursued GHG regulation within their own jurisdictions. This trend is likely to continue to grow under President Biden's leadership. A bipartisan coalition of governors from twenty-five states and U.S. territories have established the U.S. Climate Alliance to combat climate change through the implementation of state policies that are consistent with the U.S. goal of the Paris Agreement. Many of these policies are currently affecting or expected to affect our assets residing in those specific states and increase our compliance-related costs, the extent of which is yet unknown. 
In addition to issuing executive orders, legislation, and promulgating regulations for GHG emissions, states and local governments in California, Oregon, and Washington have taken advantage of tools like cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, and GHG reporting and tracking programs. For example, the Governor of Oregon issued an executive order in March 2020 to reduce and regulate GHGs in the state through the establishment of new annual GHG emissions reduction goals that must be met through the development of a new carbon cap and reduce program and enhanced clean fuel standards, which take effect no later than January 1, 2022. Rulemaking to implement the executive order has been ongoing since Spring 2020. The Northwest Gas Association, a trade organization of the Pacific Northwest Gas Industry, is representing the interests of interstate pipeline company members, including TC Energy, on the Rulemaking Advisory Committee for the development of the program. The extent to which GTN assets in Oregon will be impacted remains unknown, as the program is not expected to be proposed until Summer 2021. Additionally, the Washington Department of Ecology began rulemaking in 2020 to implement the Governor’s order to strengthen and standardize the consideration of climate change risks, vulnerability, and impacts in environmental assessments for certain major industrial and fossil fuel projects. During Washington’s 2020 legislative session, legislators also passed a law committing the State to becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 and strengthening intermediate reduction goals. In addition to California’s climate change plan that includes a GHG cap-and-trade program and methane leak regulations for oil and gas sites, the Governor issued an executive order in September 2020 requiring all new cars and light trucks sold in the state to be zero emission by 2035 and heavy and medium trucks to be zero emission by 2045. The promotion of electrification and use of legal tools for GHG regulation is also gaining traction at the local level. For example, in November 2020 a carbon tax was proposed to the Portland City Commission and in December 2020, the Governor of Washington and Mayor of Seattle followed in the footsteps of local government in California by introducing proposals that would cut demand for natural gas through building 
28     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


electrification ordinances. As such, the increasing state and local GHG regulation and promotion of electrification may materially affect our business, financial condition, demand for our systems and services, operations, compliance-related costs, and more. 
Political Risks, Litigation Risks, Financial Risks
The political risks to the Partnership’s business for the immediate future is expected to be higher than it has been under former President Trump's administration. President Biden touted a comprehensive and aggressive environmental protection plan during his campaign that he promised to begin implementing immediately after taking office. Within his first week in the White House, President Biden took unprecedented executive actions in furtherance of human health and environmental protection, as well as environmental justice. Having identified climate change as one of his administration’s top four priorities, President Biden signed a number of executive actions, starting with rejoining the Paris Agreement, the largest international effort to combat climate change, which former President Trump had officially withdrawn the U.S. from on November 4, 2020. Similarly, President Biden issued an executive order on January 27, 2021, directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the issuance of new oil and gas leases on federal public lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. President Biden's robust climate change plan includes a pledge to achieve a clean energy economy by 2050 by implementing a number of initiatives through executive orders, legislation, and regulations. His climate agenda includes methane regulation, promotion of electrification, and more. The political risk to the Partnership's business is further increased by climate change-related pledges made by candidates seeking public office at the local, state, and federal levels. During former President Trump's administration, Democratic Party-sponsored legislative initiatives, such as the Clean Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s (CLEAN) Future Act and the Climate Crisis Action Plan, were proposed in 2020 but did not advance beyond the House. Now, the likelihood of passing comprehensive climate change legislation at the federal level has significantly increased. President Biden's climate agenda could require us or our customers to incur increased, potentially significant, costs to comply with new, more stringent GHG regulations. Additionally, entry into the Paris Agreement could adversely affect demand for the production of oil and natural gas and, thus, reduce demand for the services we provide to our customers. 
Litigation Risk
Over the years, litigation risks have steadily increased as environmental protection, and particularly climate change, has garnered a great deal of attention on the global stage. Large interstate pipeline projects, in particular, have been challenged in court on various environmental grounds including water protection, endangered species and habitat protection, and climate change. Litigation risk for the Partnership increased in 2020 when environmental groups and various governments took issue with former President Trump's relaxation of burdensome regulation of industry. While environmental regulation under President Biden's administration is expected to be more stringent and thus more burdensome on industry, increased litigation will likely be due to industry challenging certain environmental regulations, legislation and executive directives. As mentioned earlier, there is a high litigation risk from those who want to oppose pipeline projects on the grounds they are using invalid NWP 12s and/or other NWPs.
Financial Risk 
There are also growing financial risks as stakeholders of fossil fuel companies become increasingly concerned about the potential effects of climate change and consider shifting some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Additionally, some institutional lenders, who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies, have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the expected increase in the regulation of oil and gas companies under President Biden, particularly on the basis of climate change, will likely materially increase compliance-related costs, costs to litigate regulatory actions, and more. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climatic events like storms and floods which may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations on us and our customers.
Waste Remediation Related Environmental Issues Potentially Impacting the Partnership
We own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for natural gas pipeline operations for many years. Additionally, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. Under environmental laws such as TSCA, CERCLA, and RCRA, we could incur strict joint and several liability due to damages to natural resources as well as for remediating hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators. For example, during routine maintenance activities of our pipelines and related facilities, we may discover historical hydrocarbon or PCB contamination. Discovery of such contaminants would require prompt notification to the appropriate governmental authorities and corrective actions to timely mitigate the contamination. Moreover, an accidental release of materials into the environment during our operations may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities. Remedial costs, penalties from governmental agencies, and other damages could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. We also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at or from such third-party sites. 
Total Financial Impact of Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     29


Currently, the ultimate financial impact of complying with U.S. environmental laws and regulations is indeterminable. Compliance obligations can result in significant costs associated with installing and maintaining pollution controls, fines and penalties resulting from any regulatory violations, and potential limitations on operations. Remediation obligations can result in significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated facilities, and with damage claims arising from the contamination. The timing and complete extent of future expenditures related to environmental matters is difficult to estimate accurately because (1) interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing or evolving; (2) new claims can be brought against our existing or discontinued assets; (3) our pollution control and clean-up cost estimates may change, especially when our current estimates are based on preliminary site investigations or agreements; (4) new contaminated facilities and sites may be found, or what we know about existing sites and facilities could change; and (5) where there is potentially more than one responsible party involved in litigation, we cannot estimate our joint and several liability with certainty.
We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures costs, some of which could be material, as environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, change, and become stricter and more robust. Additional regulatory restrictions continue to be placed on activities that may have a detrimental effect on the environment. For this reason, new laws and regulations, amendments and reinterpretations, and stricter enforcement permitting programs result in compliance and remediation obligations that can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position now and in the future. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results.
Pipeline Safety Matters
Our gas pipeline systems are subject to federal pipeline safety statutes, such as the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the PSI Act), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, and Enforcement Act of 2006 (the PIPES Act), the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act), as well as regulations promulgated and administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. Pursuant to this act, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, public awareness, operation and maintenance procedures, operator qualification, minimum depth requirements and emergency procedures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain relatively higher risk areas, known as HCAs and moderate consequence areas (MCAs) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture. The HCAs for gas pipelines are predicated on high-population areas, which may include Class 3 and Class 4 areas. An MCA for gas pipelines is also based on population totals in addition to the existence of certain principal, high-capacity roadways, but an MCA does not meet the relative higher population totals of an HCA and therefore are located outside of HCA coverages.
Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Moreover, changes to pipeline safety laws by Congress and regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators. For instance, several years after publishing the gas mega proposed rulemaking, PHMSA elected to split the proposed rulemaking into three rules, also known as the "Gas Mega Rule" with the first of these rules, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, published as a final rule in October 2019. The October 2019 final rule relates specifically to gas transmission pipelines and, among other things, updates reporting and records retention standards for covered pipelines and expands the level of required integrity assessments that must be completed on certain pipeline segments outside of high consequence areas (HCAs). The October 2019 final rule also requires operators to review maximum allowable operating pressure records and perform specific remediation activities where records are not available. The Partnership will continue to assess the operational and financial impact related to the October 2019 final rule over its 15-year implementation window that began July 1, 2020 and seek to optimize recovery of those costs. The remaining rulemakings comprising the Gas Mega Rule are expected to be issued in 2021. On January 11, 2021, PHSMA finalized a published June 2020 proposed a rulemaking that would seek to ease regulatory burdens on gas transmission, distribution and gathering lines. However, we expect President Biden's administration to reconsider this rulemaking or possibly have it withdrawn.
Congress enacted the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, which reauthorized PHMSA’s hazardous liquid and gas pipeline programs only through federal Fiscal Year 2019. On December 27, 2020, the 2020 PIPES Act was signed into law and authorizes general funding for PHMSA as well as prescribes a number of priorities for PHMSA through federal fiscal year 2023. Key items include: additional due process protections for operators during enforcement proceedings; updating the federal safety standards for the operation and maintenance of large-scale liquefied natural gas facilities; clarifying the applicability of the pipeline safety regulations to idle pipelines; and reviewing each operator’s operation and maintenance plan within two years. The 2020 Pipes 
30     TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020


Act also established a new three-year program for advancing pipeline safety technologies, testing, and operational practices and increasing the number of PHMSA inspection and enforcement personnel by 20%. 
Other proposed rules:
Valve Installation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards- On February 6, 2020 PHMSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Pipeline Safety: Valve Installation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards. The NPRM proposes to revise existing regulation for gas transmission pipelines to address congressional mandates, incorporate recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board, and to reduce the consequences of large-volume, uncontrolled releases of natural gas pipeline ruptures. Specifically, the NPRM seeks to set requirements for the placement, function, and maintenance of automatic shut off and/or remote-control mainline valves to mitigate the effects of a pipeline rupture. The NPRM also seeks to set time requirements for the identification of, and response to, pipeline ruptures.
Class Location Change Requirements - On October 14, 2020, PHMSA, published an NPRM entitled Class Location Change Requirements. PHMSA is proposing to revise the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to amend the requirements for gas transmission pipeline segments that experience a change in class location. Under the existing regulations, pipeline segments located in areas where the population density has significantly increased must perform one of the following actions: reduce the pressure of the pipeline segment, pressure test the pipeline segment to higher standards, or replace the pipeline segment. This proposed rule would add an alternative set of requirements operators could use, based on implementing integrity management principles and pipe eligibility criteria, to manage certain pipeline segments where the class location has changed from a Class 1 location to a Class 3 location. Through required periodic assessments, repair criteria, and other extra preventive and mitigative measures, PHMSA expects this alternative approach would provide long-term safety benefits consistent with the current natural gas pipeline safety rules while also providing cost savings for pipeline operators. 
While the above rulemaking process is expected to be lengthy, efforts to modernize the existing PHMSA regulations could have a material effect on our costs.
Compliance with existing pipeline safety laws and implementing regulations could cause our pipeline systems to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure their continued safe and reliable operation and to comply with the federal pipeline safety statutes and regulations. The promulgation of new laws and rulemaking regarding pipeline safety are likely and, despite compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures that could impact the surrounding population and environment. This may result in civil and/or criminal fines and penalties or third-party property damage claims and could require additional testing or upgrades on the pipeline system unrelated to the incident. It is possible that these costs may not be covered by insurance or recoverable through rate increases. There can be no assurance that future compliance with the requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our pipeline systems and the Partnership's financial position, operational costs, cash flow and our ability to maintain current distribution levels to the extent the increased costs are not recoverable through rates.
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Our pipelines are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. The OSHA and analogous state agencies oversee the implementation of these laws and regulations. Additionally, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Historically, worker safety and health compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results. While pipeline operators may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards, such increases in costs of compliance, and the extent to which they might be recoverable through our pipeline’s rates, cannot be estimated at this time. 
Cyber security
We rely on our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information pipeline operators use to safely operate our assets. We, our operators and other energy infrastructure companies in jurisdictions where we do business continue to face cyber security risks. Cyber security events could be directed against companies in the energy infrastructure industry.
A breach in the security of our information technology could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical information and functions. This could affect our operations, damage our assets and result in safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions and potential litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and results of operations.
TC Energy, the indirect parent of our General Partner and the operator of most of our assets, has a cyber security strategy which aligns with industry and recognized standards for cyber security. This strategy includes cyber security risk assessments, preventions, continuous monitoring of networks and other information sources for threats to the organization, comprehensive 
TC PipeLines, LP Annual Report 2020     31


incident response plans/processes and a cyber security awareness program for employees. Although TC Energy also has insurance which may cover losses from physical damage to our facilities as a result of a cyber security event, the insurance does not cover all events in all circumstances. There is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against these threats will be recovered through rates.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
We do not have any employees. While human capital is necessary for us to operate our business, we are managed and operated by our General Partner, therefore we do not directly make decisions regarding our service providers. Subsidiaries of TC Energy operate most of our pipelines systems pursuant to operating agreements, with the exception of the Iroquois pipeline system and the Joint Facilities. The Iroquois pipeline system is operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Iroquois. The Joint Facilities are operated by MNOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MNE. MNE is a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc.
