ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 SeaChange International, Inc. (“SeaChange,” the “Company,” “us,” or “we”), a Delaware corporation founded on July 9, 1993, is an industry leader in the delivery of multiscreen, advertising and premium over the top (“OTT”) video management solutions headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. Our software products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video and advertising content for service providers, telecommunications companies, satellite operators, broadcasters and other content providers. We sell our software products and services worldwide, primarily to service providers including: operators, such as Liberty Global, plc., Altice NV, Cox Communications, Inc. and Rogers Communications, Inc.; telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., AT&T, Inc. and Frontier Communications Corporation; satellite operators such as Dish Network Corporation; and broadcasters.
 Our software products and services are designed to empower video providers to create, manage and monetize the increasingly personalized, highly engaging experiences that viewers demand. Using our products and services, we believe customers can increase revenue by offering services such as video-on-demand (“VOD”) programming on a variety of consumer devices, including televisions, mobile telephones (“smart phones”), personal computers (“PCs”), tablets and OTT streaming players. Our solutions enable service providers to offer other interactive television services that allow subscribers to receive personalized services and interact with their video devices, thereby enhancing their viewing experience. Our products also allow our customers to insert advertising into broadcast and VOD content.
SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasingly required, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewing habits are shifting. The primary driver of our business is enabling the delivery of video content in the changing multiscreen television environment. We have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players. We believe that our strategy of expanding into adjacent product lines will also position us to further support and maintain our existing service provider customer base. Providing our customers with more scalable software platforms enables them to further reduce their infrastructure costs, improve reliability and expand service offerings to their customers. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serve adjacent markets. Our core technologies provide a foundation for software products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber activity across multiple devices.
 We have implemented restructuring programs and cost saving initiatives during the past three years to improve operations and optimize our cost structure. In fiscal 2020, we streamlined our operations and closed our service organizations in Ireland and the Netherlands, for which we realized annualized cost savings of approximately $6.0 million. In the first half of fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for which we expect approximately $7.6 million of annualized savings. Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in an effort to further reduce cost.
 In February 2019, we acquired Xstream A/S, a leading OTT media cloud platform provider with its primary operations in Warsaw, Poland. Xstream provides a managed service, OTT video solution that serves more than five million active subscribers globally. Xstream’s MediaMaker video platform has enhanced the SeaChange end-to-end video framework. We have used the acquisition of Xstream to accelerate our penetration in OTT and new market segments and a fully cloud-based end-to-end video platform that operates in a hosted managed service environment. 
In February 2019, we entered into a cooperation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with TAR Holdings LLC and Karen Singer (collectively, “TAR Holdings”). As of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, TAR Holdings beneficially owned approximately 20.6% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement executed on February 28, 2019, we agreed to set the size of the Board at up to eight members, appointed

Robert Pons to the Board as a Class II Director with an initial term that expired at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, and appointed Jeffrey Tuder to the Board as a Class III Director with an initial term that expired at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Messrs. Pons and Tuder were subsequently re-elected in the 2019 and 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, respectively. On January 8, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer resigned, and Mr. Pons was subsequently appointed Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer in the interim.
 In March 2019, our Board approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the “Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”) to deter acquisitions of our common stock that would potentially limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes (“NOLs”) to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations.  In connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019 to our stockholders of record on that date.  The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.
 In February 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which registered an indeterminate number of shares of common stock, preferred stock, Series A Participating Preferred Stock, warrants or rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock, and units (collectively, the “Securities”) using a “shelf” registration or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of $200 million. The shelf registration was declared effective on March 16, 2021.
 In connection with the shelf registration statement, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. on March 30, 2021, to issue and sell 10,323,484 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a public offering price of $1.85 per share (the “Offering”). The Offering closed on April 1, 2021 and resulted in approximately $17.6 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5%, or $0.12025 per share of common stock, and estimated offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million. In addition to the Offering, the Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,548,522 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1.85 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
 In March 2021, we entered into a Sublease Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) to our current headquarters office lease at 500 Totten Pond Road, Waltham, Massachusetts that provides for an early termination of such sublease effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease the Company will pay the sublandlord a termination payment of approximately $430 thousand against an obligation of approximately $2.8 million. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025. As a result of the Termination Agreement, we expect annualized savings of approximately $600 thousand in facilities costs for each of the next four years. 
PRODUCTS
 FRAMEWORK 
 Our business is focused on offering an end-to-end video delivery platform (the “Framework”). Framework is a value-based engagement, which provides content and service providers with a complete software delivery platform for linear, VOD and time shift TV over managed and unmanaged networks. Framework includes, but is not limited to, the following modules: video back-office, media asset management, targeted advertising management, analytics and the client interface for set-top boxes, Smart-TVs and mobile devices. Our revenue sources consist of Framework revenue from these areas as well as related services. Framework is available as a perpetual license, Software as a Service (“SaaS”), and/or managed service, on-premises, cloud and hybrid. 
 Video Back-Office
 The back-office is a comprehensive software platform that enables content and service providers to manage, monetize and deliver a seamless viewing experience to subscribers across TVs, PCs, tablets, smart phones and other IP-enabled devices.

Media Asset Management
In today’s multiscreen viewing environment, programming or advertisements are reproduced with numerous variants to serve the unique requirements of multiple network types, consumer devices and geographies. Metadata, such as poster, description and pricing, associated with the programming, is also managed by the platform. At the point of content ingest, our media asset management software is used to receive, manage and publish video content for viewing on televisions, tablets, PCs and other consumer devices. Our media asset management simplifies the increasingly complex tasks of movie and television program asset tracking, metadata management, and overall content workflow processing.
 Advanced Advertising Platform
 As more video content is served to multiple consumer devices, the ability to generate additional revenue by inserting advertising across multiple platforms becomes crucial to service providers seeking to offset content rights costs and reduce subscriber fees for viewing the content. The advanced advertising platform enables service providers to maximize advertising revenue across multiscreen, broadcast, on-demand and OTT viewing and reach their audiences while viewers watch content across multiple devices. The advanced advertising platform also enables targeted, real time and programmatic advertisement insertion to optimize the revenue generation.
Client Application
 The client application empowers service providers and content owners to optimize live and on-demand video consumption on multiscreen and OTT services.

Analytics
 Analytics equips operators with valuable insight into subscriber engagement with their video service in order to optimize retention and monetization. Extensive, pre-built dashboards and reports provide a robust view of VOD catalog engagement, channel lineup utilization, and promotion effectiveness for increased transactional revenues. The benefits of analytic insights include, but are not limited to, identifying at-risk subscribers to incentivize them and reduce the risk of churn, determining effective promotions to increase VOD revenues and catalog productivity, and tracking asset popularity to make accurate business decisions about content providers and VOD price points.
Services
 SeaChange offers comprehensive technical support and maintenance including an onsite dedicated engineer for Framework projects.  We have developed extensive capabilities in systems integration, implementation and customer engineering.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We have focused and streamlined our research and development efforts in recent years. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to develop and rapidly introduce new integrated solutions and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements in our current and future customer base as well as new markets. We have made substantial investments in developing and bringing to market our next generation software products which utilize microservices-based software architectures and advanced orchestration. Our current research and development activities are focused on developing cloud-based multiscreen television platforms, content management solutions, additional user experience applications, advertising solutions and integrating the solutions we currently offer. The majority of our research and development efforts are performed by our engineering and development team in Warsaw, Poland.  
SELLING AND MARKETING 
 Our sales cycle has historically been long, in some instances up to 12-24 months. Framework engagements can be large and span for multiple years and it can be difficult to predict in what fiscal period the sale will occur. We primarily utilize a direct sales process and work closely with customers to understand and define their needs. We use several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of Framework. We also market certain features of Framework to systems integrators and value-added resellers. We attend and exhibit Framework at a limited number of prominent industry trade shows and conferences, when available, and we present our technology at seminars and smaller conferences to promote awareness. 
OUR CUSTOMERS
 We currently sell our products primarily to video service providers, such as cable system operators and telecommunications companies, as well as content providers. Historically, a significant portion of our revenue in any given fiscal period has been derived from substantial orders placed by these large organizations. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 
 We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the near future, even as we intend to penetrate new markets and customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders because of changes in customer requirements or new product announcements or introductions. In addition, the concentration of customers may cause variations in revenue, expenses and operating results on a quarterly basis due to seasonality of orders, the timing and relative size of orders received and accepted during a fiscal quarter, or the timing and size of orders for which revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied during a fiscal quarter.

COMPETITION 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by intense competition, with many suppliers providing different types of products to different segments of the markets. In new markets for our products, we compete based on price, functionality and delivery capabilities. In markets in which we have an established presence, we compete principally based on the breadth of our products’ features and benefits, including the flexibility, scalability, professional quality, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of our products, and our reputation and the depth of our expertise, customer service and support. While we believe that we currently compete favorably overall with respect to these factors and that our ability to provide integrated solutions to manage and distribute digital video differentiates us from our competitors, in the future we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors. 
 In the market for multiscreen video, we compete with various larger companies offering video platforms and applications such as Synamedia, Arris Group Inc., TiVo and MediaKind, as well as in-house solutions built by the service providers. Increasingly, we are also seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and many OTT providers. We expect the competition in each of the markets in which we operate to intensify in the future with existing and new competitors with significant market presence and financial resources.
 Many of our current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, these companies may introduce additional products that are competitive with ours or enter strategic relationships to offer complete solutions. Therefore, our products may not be able to compete effectively with these products from these companies in the future. 
 PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon the proprietary rights of our intellectual property. We currently have 16 patents in the United States (“U.S.”) expiring between 2022 and 2032. In addition, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademark laws, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. It is possible that the validity of these patents would not be upheld. 
 It is also possible that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be distributed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Currently, we are not party to intellectual property litigation, but we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others’ intellectual property.
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 As of January 31, 2021, we had 153 employees worldwide, of whom 29 were in our U.S. operations and 124 were in our international operations. All employees as of January 31, 2021 were full-time employees with the exception of 3 part-time employees. We also use other temporary employees and contractors in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by local works council as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions.
Total Rewards
 We offer competitive wages, annual bonus opportunities, a 401(k) retirement savings plan for U.S. employees, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, and flexible work schedules.

Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented operational changes with the primary objective to provide safety to our employees and to comply with government regulations. We have adopted a distributed workforce model, including for some employees, a long-term, full-time work from home arrangement, while implementing additional safety measures for employees and contractors continuing essential and critical on-site work.
