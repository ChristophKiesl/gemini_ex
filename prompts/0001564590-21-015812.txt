Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a leading telehealth company enabling digital delivery of care for healthcare’s key stakeholders. We empower our clients at the enterprise level with the core technology and services necessary to successfully develop and distribute telehealth programs that meet their strategic, operational, and social objectives under their own brands. The Amwell Platform is a complete digital care delivery solution that equips our health system, health plan and innovator, including government, clients with the tools to enable new models of care for their patients and members. Our scalable technology embeds with our clients’ existing offerings and clinical workflows, spanning the continuum of care and enabling care delivery across a wide variety of clinical, retail, school and home settings. Our client-focused approach drives our success as one of the largest telehealth companies. As of December 31, 2020, we powered the digital care programs of 58 health plans, which support over 36,000 employers and collectively represent more than 80 million covered lives, as well as 158 of the nation’s largest health systems, encompassing more than 2,000 hospitals. Since inception, we have powered over 8.6 million telehealth visits for our clients, including more than 5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 The Amwell Platform enables care delivery across the full healthcare continuum – from primary and urgent care in the home to high acuity specialty consults, such as telestroke and telepsychiatry, in the hospital. We support both on-demand and scheduled consultations and offer pre-packaged care modules and programs that power over 100 unique use cases today. Our platform can be fully embedded into our clients’ patient/member portals and provider workflows. Providers can launch telehealth directly from their native EHRs, with seamless integration to their payer eligibility and claims systems. Providers, patients and members can access this care through a full range of Carepoints™, including via mobile, web, phone and our proprietary kiosks and carts that support multi-way video, phone or secure messaging interactions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 68,000 of our clients’ providers use the Amwell Platform to serve their patients and members. When needed, we augment and extend our clients’ clinical capabilities with Amwell Medical Group (“AMG”), a nationwide clinical network of over 5,000 multi-disciplinary providers covering 50 states with 24/7/365 coverage. 
Our Industry Opportunities 
 Healthcare today is inefficient, expensive, complicated and fragmented – resulting in substantial challenges for providers, health plans, and patients. We believe telehealth is central to overcoming these key structural challenges, which include: 

• | Solving the Access Crisis Driven by Provider Shortages and Inefficient Resource Allocation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Addressing Increasing Healthcare Costs for All Key Stakeholders;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promoting Greater Coordination of Care; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Optimizing Patient Experience to Drive Recruitment and Retention.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solution 
 To capture these opportunities, we believe clients are seeking a comprehensive solution to support their connected care goals and consolidate unintegrated vendors and in-house designed solutions. 
One Platform, Powering the Care Continuum 
 The Amwell Platform is a scalable, secure telehealth platform that supports a full range of telehealth functionality. The Amwell Platform consists of the Home line (provider-to-patient telehealth interactions, typically in the home), the Hospital line (supporting provider-to-provider telehealth interactions, or provider-to-patient, typically in an inpatient or ambulatory setting) and Amwell Now which straddles the home and hospital lines by providing an easy way for providers to connect patients in the home or hospital. Our enterprise solution offers clients the ability to implement and quickly expand their telehealth offerings across many areas of clinical practice. Our platform is a highly configurable, white-labeled infrastructure that enables clients to deliver telehealth under their own brands and with their own providers. We offer a full range of management software, clinical workflows, CarepointTM hardware and system integrations to deliver care across many modalities, including video, phone and secure messaging. Our platform is designed to support the continuum of care by offering the specific workflows and device solutions needed to deliver this care.

Our open architecture allows the Amwell Platform to connect to existing systems, devices and access endpoints and to embed telehealth into our clients’ workflows. Our SDKs enable access to a broad set of APIs to offer clients the ability to integrate, embed and customize telehealth across their digital domains, including: 
  
• | Patient access points such as white-labeled web and mobile apps, 24-hour nurse and customer support lines and customer applications, such as patient or member “digital front doors”;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provider access points, such as EHR systems, including Cerner, Epic and more. Clinicians can launch telehealth visits from within their EHRs, add records of new patients acquired via telehealth and share consult data through our bidirectional integrations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administrative functions such as enrollment, clinical management, payment, eligibility and claims administration, e-prescribing, follow-up and data interchange.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Amwell Platform is designed to quickly launch and remotely implement telehealth offerings for our clients and grow with them as they broaden their digital offerings through additional modules for a wide variety of use cases. Health systems typically begin with either urgent care or an acute use case, such as telestroke or telepsychiatry, and subsequently add modules for areas such as scheduled specialty follow-up visits, virtual rounding, school-based services and more. Health plans typically begin with an urgent care service and later add behavioral health or other services designed to support the needs of their employer clients, such as breastfeeding support, EAP therapy or nutrition services. In emergency situations, such as natural disasters or the recent COVID-19 pandemic, our clients can start new practices and see patients using our telehealth solution in a matter of days. 
 We have designed the Amwell Platform to be intuitive and convenient for both patients and providers: 
  
• | Patients—For patient-initiated on-demand visits, patients can either choose a specific provider or elect to see the next available physician. For scheduled visits, patients are guided through pre-visit readiness assessments and can enroll themselves and their dependents, enter their medical history, check insurance coverage and select video or phone visits. Post visit, patients can access their visit record or share it with other providers in their care team. The Amwell Platform is rated an average of 4.8 out of 5 stars by patients on all health system and health plan platforms, as well as our direct-to-consumer platform, and has achieved an average NPS score of 56 across our clients’ various branded services for the full-year period ended December 31, 2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers—The Amwell Platform is designed to deliver an easy-to-use provider experience via web or mobile application. Providers access familiar workflows for taking notes, prescribing, referencing clinical treatment guidelines and alerts for gaps in care or referral protocols. Importantly, many of our modules can be initiated directly from within a provider’s EHR system, creating a seamless experience and reducing redundant data entry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carepoints Enable a Variety of Clinical Settings 
 Patients and members access our platform through a wide variety of Carepoints. These Carepoints include not only patient and provider supplied devices for app-based access over web, mobile and phone, but also a full range of purpose-built devices for use in clinical settings. Our proprietary Carepoint portfolio, which includes the C500, Touchpoint Table, and Hospital TV, enables providers to deliver digital care into clinical care locations, such as the Emergency Department (the “ED”) and clinics, as well as into community settings such as retail stores, community centers, employer sites, skilled nursing facilities and schools. These devices are built to rigorous safety and clinical standards and have advanced features including far-end camera controls, fleet monitoring and connectivity to a variety of diagnostic scopes and examination tools. Our Carepoints support a range of modalities including multi-way video, phone connectivity and secure messaging to bring care teams to patients and members in the most efficient way possible. 
 Value-Added Services 
 We offer a full suite of paid, supporting services to our clients to enable their telehealth offerings. AMG is a 24/7/365 nationwide provider group with care capabilities that have been accredited with the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”), Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (“URAC”) Telehealth Accreditation Program and the Joint Commission. AMG employs more than 5,000 providers across primary and urgent care, behavioral health therapy, acute psychiatry, lactation counseling and nutrition to provide licensed, reimbursable medical staffing for digital care delivery to our clients. AMG can be used to augment provider capacity during nights, weekends or times of high demand, fill gaps in specialist coverage in acute hospital settings and to enable expanded geographic coverage in cases where state-level licensing requirements restrict the ability of our clients’ own physicians to treat patients outside of their own geographic locations. Additionally, we provide professional services to facilitate telehealth implementation, workflow design, systems integration and service expansion. To help our clients promote adoption and utilization, we offer highly effective patient and provider engagement services through our internal digital engagement agency.

Our Market Opportunity 
 Core U.S. Digital Care Market 
 We believe the annual total addressable market for our solutions is substantial and increasing. We estimate the current subscription revenue market opportunity for health plan and health system customers to be approximately $8.7 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. There are over 290 million lives enrolled in insurance plans that we have identified as potential subscribers to our platform. We have also identified 802 health systems who would potentially benefit from the Amwell Platform. For AMG, we estimate the urgent care and telepsychiatry visit revenue market opportunity to be approximately $18.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. 
Additional Digital Care Market Opportunities 
 We intend to grow our addressable market through continued expansion into market adjacencies that we believe represent a significant opportunity to serve millions of additional potential patients and members. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
 Enabling Our Clients to Deliver the Continuum of Care 
 Our platform enables our clients to utilize their own provider networks to digitally distribute treatment to their patients and members across the continuum of care. This capability was demonstrated most clearly during the recent COVID-19 crisis, when our health system and health plan clients were able to deploy tens of thousands of their own providers onto their telehealth platforms. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 68,000 active providers utilized the Amwell Platform to address their patients’ needs, from primary care, the management of chronic care and specialist visits. We offer provider training, outreach and success services to drive increased patient acquisition and retention, appropriate utilization and better outcomes. We believe our ability to provide our clients with a platform that allows them to utilize their own trusted providers and networks differentiates us within our industry. 
Flexible and Scalable Suite of Solutions 
 Our scalable platform allows us to grow with the digital care delivery needs of our clients. Most clients start by providing a single use case, such as urgent care, or start with a subset of their members or patients, such as employer administrative services. As our clients expand their digital care delivery solutions, they can add modules that support additional specialists or specific use cases across broader patient and/or member populations. Our products are currently available in more than 40 modules or programs that offer the necessary workflows to deliver care across over 100 individual use cases. In addition to clients increasing their telemedicine use cases over time, they tend to expand their use of Carepoints as well as consumer devices. As we expand our capabilities, our module, program and Carepoint-based approach allows us to partner with clients that are new to telehealth as well as with rapidly expanding telehealth market leaders. 
Client-Branded, Embedded Digital Experiences 
 Our configurable Amwell Platform and its associated SDKs and APIs encourages our clients to white-label and deploy telehealth programs under their own brands, unlike other telehealth players who promote programs under their own names. Our differentiated approach empowers our clients to advance the look, feel and trust associated with their market-leading brands while we provide the core technology and clinical support to enable quality patient and member care. We are aligned with clients and partner to build tailored digital care distribution programs instead of competing with them for their patients. 
Platform Integration That Provides for the Efficient Delivery of Digital Care 
 We enable digital care distribution to be integrated into existing care pathways and workflows rather than as a separate experience. Our proprietary SDKs, APIs and system integrations enable clients to embed telehealth into existing workflows utilized by providers and patients. Our platform is provided directly within or synchronized with our providers’ EHR systems, including Cerner and Epic, as well as through the mobile apps, 24-hour nurse and customer support lines and “digital front doors” that patients and members access. We also integrate with back end systems to streamline administrative functions such as enrollment, clinical management, payment, claims administration, e-prescribing, follow-up and data interchanges such as picture archiving and communication systems (“PACS”). For our clients, this functionality eases administrative burdens and supports physician workflows. For patients and members, our embedded functionality simplifies digital care delivery directly into the portals and systems those individuals are already utilizing.

Connected Ecosystem of Health Systems, Health Plans and Innovators 
 We partner with many of the world’s largest and most trusted health systems, health plans and healthcare innovators. Our broad range of connected healthcare providers is attractive to health plans seeking to expand their care networks, while health systems are drawn to a network with a large number of health plans that allows for the possibility to extend their services through the digital distribution of their care. Our ecosystem benefits from scale in our client base across each stakeholder vertical. For example, we currently work with 30 of the 36 Blue plans nationally, who benefited as we added more of their cohort and allowed members with Blue cards to seamlessly access digitally distributed care outside the geography of their individual Blue plan. Our ecosystem is also strengthened by our partnerships with innovators that bring new services and capabilities to the Amwell Platform. Finally, the breadth of our ecosystem has enabled a deep understanding of health system and health plan workflows and reimbursement arrangements between our clients, allowing us to tailor our capabilities to their needs. 
Access to Scalable, On-Demand Medical Services to Help Support Our Clients’ Digital Care Solutions 
 As part of our mission to enable digital care distribution, we offer our clients a medical staffing solution for digital health services through AMG, representing over 5,000 multi-disciplinary providers with 24/7/365 coverage across 50 states, that integrates with and extends their existing care capabilities. Our acquisition of Aligned Telehealth Inc. (the “Aligned Acquisition”) bolstered AMG’s roster to now include over 1,000 behavioral health providers, strengthening the network we are able to offer our customers. For health plans, AMG provides essential nationwide clinical coverage for members across a broad range of specialties. For health systems, most require clinical support for their initial programs and then transition to weekend or evening coverage as their providers come onboard. During natural disasters or emergent health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, AMG can quickly augment staffing needs. By delivering access to on-demand medical staffing, we believe AMG brings trust and stability to our clients’ digital care delivery solutions. 
Experienced Management 
 Our management team has extensive operational experience in healthcare, technology and services. Our co-founders are experienced entrepreneurs with a proven track record of successfully founding, growing and leading multiple companies. Our executive leadership team has an average of 20 plus years of experience. We believe our management team’s extensive business experience, along with the backing of key strategic healthcare investors, sets Amwell apart in the industry. 
Our Growth Strategies 
 Drive Greater Adoption with our Existing Clients 
 We intend to continue to drive greater adoption among existing clients in four ways: 
  
• | Expanding the populations to which they offer services—Health plans may begin by offering telehealth to a subset of their total membership and over time expand to more members. Health systems may start with a single hospital or region and then expand system wide.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing adoption within existing populations—We see significant increases in utilization among clients as providers and patients have become more aware of and comfortable with telehealth, and as clients have embedded digital care more fully into their operations. We use targeted patient and provider engagement campaigns, best practices training as well as operational support to further drive an increase in usage across our platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adding new modules and programs—Most clients begin with one or two use cases for telehealth, but then expand into additional clinical areas. For health plans, additional programs are typically focused around the needs of employer clients and are increasingly driven by Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid business. For health systems, additional modules typically include a range of specialty care use cases across the care continuum.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding their Carepoints—Clients typically increase the number of Carepoints over time, as they penetrate additional locations and expand their own network of digital care delivery. As the number of Carepoints rise, utilization goes up and our clients recognize additional value. We intend to continue to promote our proprietary Carepoints across our client base and believe that new Carepoint offerings such as our Hospital TV and planned home TV will further expand usage of our platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Penetration by Adding New Clients within our Core Verticals 
 While we already partner with many of the largest health systems and health plans in the United States, there is still significant white space to add additional customer relationships. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid programs provide a significant growth opportunity as they continue to expand telehealth as a reimbursable service across use cases. We expect to obtain an Authority to Operate within the Department of Defense’s health services which will provide additional entry points into government health services, where we believe there is a significant opportunity for growth. We continue to invest in our direct sales force and channel management capabilities to support growth and client support. 
Invest in Platform to Continue to Expand Capabilities 
 We continue to invest in the Amwell Platform to develop new technologies, products, modules/programs and capabilities that meet the broadening needs of our clients. We also partner with our clients and other stakeholders to build new features, modules and programs. This includes the ongoing development of our digital tools program capabilities, which allow our clients to design new healthcare protocols by combining brick and mortar services with digital healthcare delivery in areas such as primary or cancer care. We plan to expand the reach of our digital platform into new areas by investing in new technologies. For example, our Hospital TV allows patients to access digital health services in their hospital room via TVs and our planned home TV Carepoint hardware solution will allow patients to access digital health services at home via TVs. We are investing in AI technology that is designed to help expand patient engagement while improving efficiencies and reducing the cost of care. The first example of this AI deployment occurred during the COVID-19 crisis, when we launched “Ami,” an AI-based COVID-19 triage chatbot tool. Ami can be configured for use with other medical conditions and assessments. Continued investment in interoperability including remote patient monitoring, advanced analytics and lab services as well as the home delivery of pharmaceuticals is expected to allow us to expand use cases. 
Increase Partnerships with Innovators to Better Enable the Digital Care Capabilities of our Clients 
 Our investments in interoperability with other technologies have allowed us to partner with innovative companies to develop unique products and services. Our current strategic partnership with Cerner, as well as relationships with Epic and other EHR providers, allows our services to be accessed directly through EHR interfaces. We support a telehealth sleep program with Philips allowing for the remote diagnosis and treatment of various common sleep disorders. We launched Second Opinion services through our Cleveland Clinic joint venture. We believe these partnerships will differentiate our offering and add new capabilities to drive demand and add value for our clients. 
Expand into International Markets 
 As regulatory and reimbursement systems around the world evolve, we see a significant opportunity to expand internationally. We signed our first major international client in 2017 when Meuhedet Health Services, a leading Israeli Health Maintenance Organization with 1.2 million covered lives, joined our platform. Meuhedet’s telehealth program, launched in 2019, created Israel’s first “Hybrid HMO” using telehealth as the first line of contact for plan members for seamless care delivery and reduced facilities costs for Meuhedet. Our acquisition of Avizia, Inc. (“Avizia”) in 2018 also brought an international footprint in telehealth Carepoint carts that we continue to grow. 
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions 
 Our comprehensive platform enables us to selectively pursue strategic and complementary assets to support our clients’ needs. We have a track record of successfully identifying and integrating acquisitions. The acquisition of Avizia in 2018 expanded our high-acuity care services and our hospital and Carepoint offerings. The Aligned Acquisition in 2019 expanded the number of behavioral health providers available in AMG and enhanced our ability to offer behavioral health resources and programs. We intend to continue to complement our strong organic growth opportunities by evaluating the acquisition of complementary products and services. Consistent with this strategy, we are engaged in a number of processes related to acquisition opportunities, some of which could be significant. 
Our Products 
 The primary product we sell is access to the Amwell Platform via recurring subscriptions. We sell additional telehealth-related services and solutions via configurable modules and programs, hardware Carepoints and services, including implementation, engagement, cart fleet management and integration. These additional services can be added to any base platform subscription. We also sell access to practices services through AMG, our affiliated medical group that provides clinical services on a fee-for-service basis, on the Amwell platform and through our direct-to-consumer app.

Our Technology and Operations 
 Regardless of access modality, our technology platform is designed to provide superior patient and provider experiences, encompassing the complete end-to-end telehealth visit. Our backend architecture also supports security, data exchange, integration with EHRs, other data repositories and third-party devices. Finally, we offer a portfolio of services to our clients to support their telehealth platform. 
Amwell Home Line 
 Multiple Digital Practices 
 Care is organized into online practices, analogous to a multi-specialty hospital building, allowing patients to choose from a variety of clinical offerings, ranging from primary to specialty care and from wellness to disease. Practices can be organized by clinical specialty (including primary care, behavioral health, nutrition, cardiology), by disease state (including diabetes, asthma, hypertension) or by program type (including smoking cessation, weight loss, addiction therapy). Each practice typically represents a distinct clinical use case with its own associated client branding, patient workflows, associated providers, eligibility, and pricing. 
Flexible Access to Care 
 Patients can access clinical services anytime, anywhere, from their smartphones, tablets or computers. We support all major web browsers and both iOS and Android mobile devices. Clients can choose to configure our white-labeled web and mobile app experiences with their own branding or use our patient SDK to embed our telehealth functionality in their own existing web and mobile experiences. 
 When a video connection is inappropriate or otherwise not possible, a voice-only phone visit can be substituted, though clinical best practice favors video. Consumers can also access care through our line of client-branded telehealth carts and kiosks, which function as fixed access points equipped with dedicated medical-grade diagnostic devices. 
 Emphasis on the Consumer Experience 
 Regardless of access technology, the consumer experience is designed to be consistently easy-to-use, convenient, personal, and private. We use the latest web and mobile technologies and user interface design principles to create an intuitive experience that is easy to navigate and requires no user manual or advance training. 
 We enable patients to choose the practice they wish to visit, the provider they prefer to see, and the pharmacy where they intend to pick up potential prescriptions. Just like in a physical visit, patients enter their chief complaint and associated symptoms, register or update their medical history, allergies, and medications, provide relevant insurance and payment information as appropriate, and conclude by consenting to share their personal health record. Patients may also import clinical data and biometrics via Apple HealthKit. 
 The telehealth visit itself is delivered by the provider over high definition video using proprietary technology that adapts real-time to available bandwidth. The image is high definition via WiFi or 4G, yet still usable over 3G. Patients can see and talk live to the provider while also chatting on their computer screen if they so choose. Providers can review the patient’s clinical information, answer questions, document the visit, and, as appropriate, diagnose and electronically prescribe therapy. At the conclusion of each visit, patients are asked to rate the provider and the experience and are afforded the opportunity to answer a few custom questions. The visit summary is available anytime for patient download or secure email to another designated provider. 
 On-Demand and Scheduled Visits 
 For urgent care and walk-in clinic type use cases, patients can seek care on-demand whenever coverage is available (typically 24/7 for urgent care). They can choose either to see the next available provider or to select a specific provider from among those currently practicing online. If a provider is busy seeing other patients, the patient can choose to wait in queue. 
 For non-urgent cases and for continuity of care, including most specialty care, patients can choose scheduled appointments. Appointments can either be self-scheduled by patients or scheduled on their behalf by an administrator or provider. Provider availability can be synchronized with a client’s master EHR schedule using our scheduling API, eliminating the need for duplicate and potentially conflicting scheduling systems for physical and online appointments.

Alternatively, our “Amwell Now” functionality allows providers to initiate both scheduled and on-demand visits by sending an email or text message invitation. Visit requests can also be triggered automatically by client-configured analytics and alarms using our Telehealth Now web service. Within a few clicks, patients go from email to live video visit, without ever having to manually register or download any software. This provider-initiated visit functionality is useful for both follow-up and more general population health and care management programs. 
 Multi-Way Collaborative Care 
 Our multi-way video functionality allows the patient and primary provider to each invite via email up to 20 concurrent participants in the telehealth visit. Patients may choose to invite a remote spouse, parent, adult child or other caregiver. Providers may choose to invite a peer, a specialist, another care team member, or a translator. Multi-way visits can also be used for group therapy and training. After clicking on the email invite, the participants are simultaneously displayed in a grid of live video allowing everyone to actively discuss and collaborate. 
Web or Mobile Provider Access 
 Providers serving patients in the Home Line can see patients via a range of access Carepoints, including computer, tablet, and mobile phones. The key elements of a physical office are available at their fingertips, including appointment calendar, online waiting room, past visit history, clinical documentation tools, e-prescription, billing and coding, and task lists. Alternatively, provider access can be embedded directly into the traditional EHR user interface and workflow. Our flexible access functionality allows providers to see patients wherever they are practicing, whether at the office or remotely. Through our “provider global home” feature, providers can simultaneously declare their availability, display their services, and aggregate patients into a single online waiting room spanning multiple client platforms using our exchange functionality. This demand aggregation functionality allows providers to log in only once and maintain a single waiting room queue, regardless of where the patient originates. 
Insight Tools 
 Our teleprompter-like “Insight” functionality allows relevant patient medical history, alerts, gaps-in-care, and clinical protocols to be imported from a client’s existing information systems and displayed to the provider at the point of care. Using our data integration APIs, providers can document either via our telehealth provider interface or in their own native EHR. When we integrate fully with another EHR, we read in data from the master EHR and write back changes, only storing locally generated data on our system for auditing purposes. When there is no integrated master EHR, our platform assumes the role of maintaining the relevant health record. Data and notes from a telehealth visit can be sent to other providers via secure email or exported back to the EHR of record in the form of a standard Continuity of Care Record (“CCR”) or Continuity of Care Document (“CCD”) data. 
Physician Brokerage and Utilization Efficiency 
 Our patented, real-time brokerage engine matches each patient with the list of available and eligible providers, based on licensing requirements and client-configurable clinical, business and regulatory rules. In this way, we are distinguished from other “callback” models where provider choice is much more limited and is unable to occur real-time. 
 Our “Ask-Me” provider availability functionality allows providers to declare their potential availability to see patients. When patients seek services, one or more potentially available providers are digitally paged or notified based on client-configurable business rules. The first provider to accept the visit request is assigned the patient. Together these matching technologies ensure the most efficient use of available providers, allowing even busy clinicians to schedule in telehealth patients between physical appointments, after hours, or in place of no-shows and cancellations. 
 Amwell Hospital Line 
 The Amwell Hospital Line offers hospital-based care teams everything they need to conduct provider-to provider Acute Care consults in an efficient, scalable and easy to use experience accessed via web, mobile apps and proprietary hardware Carepoints. The clinician portal is a browser-based solution for providers and administrators, while the Touchpoint mobile app facilitates coordination for providers and care team members on iOS and Android devices. Regardless of location, care teams can review requests, communicate with others, and join a video call to deliver timely and effective care.

Workflows 
 Amwell Hospital Line offers configurable, specialty-specific software workflows to enable rapid and effective response to Acute Care needs, in accordance with a hospital’s care policies. As part of the implementation process, an Amwell team will understand current and desired workflows and configure the system to meet the needs of a particular administrative staff and care team. 
Call Calendar for Each Workflow 
 The Call Calendar function within Amwell Hospital allows a hospital team to manage the on-call schedules of its clinicians, and create an individual or a bulk schedule, making it easy to manage daily, weekly or monthly clinician assignments. The Call Calendar also allows a hospital team to quickly identify and contact clinicians who are on-call. Clinicians can also manage their own availability and set preferred on-call contact methods. 
Initiate a Case 
 Modules within Amwell Hospital Line enable staff members to quickly and easily initiate a “case” for Acute Care telehealth. Staff coordinators can clearly see and manage the total case queue and assign available providers to a case. Workflow configuration can be set up to allow a coordinator to manage case assignments or to enable providers to assign themselves to cases. 
Case Alerts and Notification Preferences (SMS, Email, Pager) 
 The Amwell Hospital Line allows providers to manage both contact preferences and notification preferences. Providers may receive notifications via text message, email or SMS based pager. These alert tools are also accessible for administrators, which provides flexibility for managing providers’ needs. 
Case Escalation 
 Amwell Hospital Case escalations can be configured to ensure that health system patients are cared for in a timely manner. Escalation notifications can be set up to go to specific roles, care team members or on-call providers based on their on-call priority. When used in tandem with the Call Calendar, primary, secondary and even tertiary contacts for escalation can be configured. For example, when a new case is added for a particular workflow, the first on-call clinician receives an alert according to their preferred contact method. If that provider doesn’t respond within the configured time frame, the second contact is notified. 
Care Coordination and Collaboration Tools 
 Amwell Hospital Line care coordination tools improve response times with case assignment tools, automated alerts and auto-escalation to avoid delays in patient care. This set of tools allows coordinators to schedule and assign providers to cases and manage the case queue. Care teams can be notified via text message, email, SMS enabled pager, on the clinician portal or the Touchpoint mobile app when a new patient case is created, assigned to a provider, escalated, cancelled or completed. Amwell Hospital Line empowers case team members with coordination tools that we believe are HIPAA-compliant within cases, secure messaging and multi-party video calls. Providers are further able to send secure messages between registered providers and care team members from the clinician portal and Touchpoint mobile app, as well as message other providers within the same case. 
Video and Audio Flexibility 
 Amwell Hospital’s video functionality allows users to initiate video calls between patients and providers and invite additional care team members, specialists and family into a call. Participants can be invited via care team directory, email, text message, SIP address or phone call. When an invited participant connects to an Amwell cart, they can use either use a regular phone call (audio only) or laptops or mobile devices (for audio/video). This video/audio flexibility allows for greater access across a range of care team members and family.

Advanced Far End Camera Control 
 Amwell Hospital line carts feature enhanced PTZ (“pan-tilt-zoom”) remote camera control of Amwell supported telemedicine devices from the clinician portal or mobile app. Share medical charts, clinical questionnaires, medical reports, treatment instructions, imaging and other types of documents in a video call can easily be shared with the patient and local provider on an Amwell cart. 
Technology Back-end Architecture 
 Secure, Scalable, Hosted Environment 
 We host the Amwell Platform in secure, redundant data centers designed with high levels of availability, redundant subsystems, and compartmentalized security zones. With our telehealth platform as a service telehealth solution, there is no need for clients to purchase hardware, install and upgrade software, or manage system operations. The hosted approach also ensures that visit capacity scales without requiring client-side interventions or upgrades. We manage hosting operations and security from our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) which is monitored 24 hours a day. 
 Due to the sensitive nature of our client and patient data, we have invested heavily in data security and protection. We utilize a multi-tiered security architecture. All data is secured both in motion and at rest using the latest encryption technologies. Our C3 data control center constantly monitors for vulnerabilities and intrusions, including using third-party penetration testing. We believe that all clinical data usage is HIPAA compliant. We maintain HITRUST, ISO 2701, and PCI compliance certifications. Our system security is regularly evaluated and approved by some of the largest health plans, health systems, financial institutions, and technology companies in the world. 
 Reporting and Analytics 
 We provide a range of standard administrative, utilization and clinical reports. More advanced analytics are user-accessible via our Looker data exploration and discovery business intelligence tool. 
 Branding and SDK Integration 
 We support client branding and unique client experiences by offering the ability to fully white label our software as well as to use our SDKs for both the patient and provider experiences, covering the relevant web and mobile interfaces (iOS and Android). The SDKs in turn allow clients to seamlessly embed our end-to-end patient and provider telehealth functionality in their own websites, software, and mobile applications. Such embedding is designed to give patients and providers a consistent user experience without having to switch tabs or windows, or to download additional applications. Clients also have more flexibility to rearrange workflows, turn on or off specific functionality, and customize the overall experience. 
 For example, some health systems have embedded our telehealth platform in their own patient portals. One of our innovator partners leverages our SDK to embed telehealth into an app pre-installed on tens of millions of smart phones in the United States. From a provider perspective, EHR clients are embedding the provider telehealth workflow in their EHRs so that online visits are as easy to schedule and conduct as physical visits. 
 Finally, for international clients, we use the SDK to separate the user experience requiring extensive localization from the backend core functionality that requires less locale-specific changes. For example, with Meuhedet in Israel, we use our SDK to support the Hebrew language. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our telehealth solution through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of enterprise-focused field sales professionals who are organized principally by geography. Our sales operations staff, who support our direct sales team, includes product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including media publications, industry analyst firms, benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations and health plan and health system partners. 
 10


Channel partners also play an important role in marketing and selling our products to our customer base, primarily focusing on the Amwell Platform and Carepoints. Channel partners may shorten our sales cycle and lower our customer acquisition costs. For example, through our EHR channel partners we are able to natively embed our technology into existing health system technology infrastructure which, as a competitive differentiator, may lead to a higher win rate. In addition, because of the technology integration, an EHR partner sale may accelerate our ability to launch the technology and ultimately recognize revenue. Carepoint channel partners primarily consist of value-added resellers that have established relationships with health systems and health plans. We typically generate lower revenues in connection with sales obtained through these channel partner agreements. 
 Clients 
 Our clients consist of health plans, health systems, government clients and innovator companies that are working to develop next-generation therapeutics, devices, and health programs 
 Quality 
 We are strongly focused on providing the highest level of clinical and operational quality. AMG seeks to provide the highest level of clinical quality and consistency of care. All medical professionals go through a rigorous onboarding and credential checking process. When practicing online, doctors are required to wear white coats, display degrees, and deliver care in a medically appropriate visual setting. We offer similar best practices and training to our clients who engage their own providers. Patients consistently rate AMG providers highly, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5.0. 
 Our AMG clinical operations team works to standardize medical telehealth treatment by creating and maintaining standard operating procedures. Our operations team also monitors waiting room queues and can reassign providers and patients as needed. We use analytics to test for appropriateness and efficiency of care as well as prescribing behaviors. Our team of quality nurses uses algorithms to identify potential quality issues, and also conducts manual reviews of clinical cases, utilizing a random audit process, to ensure high quality care is consistently delivered. Finally, a monthly scorecard is distributed to all AMG providers showing their individual and comparative performance. 
 From an operations perspective we historically deliver 99.9% system uptime across the Amwell Platform, maintained through our 24/7 Cyber Command Center that monitors our platforms around the clock. For urgent care, the median wait time is less than 5 minutes for the 24 months ended December 31, 2020. 
 Social Responsibility 
 Social responsibility is deeply embedded in our mission oriented corporate culture. We never forget that beyond the daily numbers and operating tasks, our goal is to transform how healthcare is delivered by improving access, convenience, economics and quality of care via telehealth, initially focusing our efforts in the United States and with an eye toward increasing the reach of such changes internationally. We are proud of our ability to extend access to both primary and specialty care in “healthcare deserts” that exist in both rural and urban pockets domestically and even more so internationally. 
Research and Development 
 Our ability to continue to differentiate and enhance our platform depends, in large part, on our capacity to continue to introduce new services, technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. We also maintain a development office in Ramat Gan, Israel, to support our international partners and to serve as an additional development resource. In addition, we utilize certain third-party development services to perform application development. We focus our research and development spend on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our solution. 
Competition 
 We view as competitors those companies whose primary business is developing and marketing telehealth platforms and services. Competition focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated services, operational experience, customer support, extent of customer base, and reputation. Our key competitors in the telehealth market are Doctor On Demand and Teladoc. 
 11


In the health system market, EHR players could be considered competitors, but many have chosen to partner with us to integrate our capabilities into their own products. Other players have chosen to partner with us to embed our telehealth functionality within their EHR. Competition also comes from large communications software players who offer an entry-level priced and simplified offering for telehealth. Newer players include companies who provide asynchronous chat communications. Competition may also increase from large technology companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon, or Microsoft, who may wish to develop their own telehealth solutions, as well as from large retailers like Amazon or Walmart. With the emergence of COVID-19, we have also seen increased competition from consumer-grade video solutions, such as Zoom Video and Twilio. We believe that the breadth of our existing client ecosystem, the depth of our technology platform, and our business-to-business focus on promoting existing healthcare brands and integrating freely with multiple platforms increases the likelihood that stakeholders seeking to develop telehealth solutions, both within and outside of healthcare, will choose instead to collaborate with Amwell. 
 Physicians and Healthcare Professionals 
 Due to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our business, we provide administrative and management services to entities associated with AMG (which are consolidated subsidiaries from a financial reporting perspective) pursuant to which those entities reserve exclusive control and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract to provide administrative services through business support agreements (“BSAs”) with AMG’s provider groups. AMG in turn employs or contracts with more than 5,000 providers. Our business support agreements typically run for ten years and call for us to be paid an annual fee in exchange for managing all administrative aspects of the medical practice in question. It has been the historical practice of the parties to review and adjust this fee on an annual basis. In addition, we have signed direct transfer agreements with the AMG entities. These direct transfer agreements outline the conditions under which we have the right to change the ownership of the clinical entity to a different third party. 
 In 2012, we entered into a joint venture with an affiliate of Anthem, Inc. to form National Telehealth Network, LLC (“NTN”). NTN, which is consolidated in our financial statements, is greater than 50% owned by us. NTN is managed by a six person Board of Managing Directors, with the Chairman of the Board appointed by us. NTN’s mandate is to oversee the clinical and administrative operations of Online Care Group, a clinical entity within the AMG family. Online Care Group is dedicated to providing clinical consults on Anthem’s LiveHealth Online telehealth platform to Anthem members and other users of that platform. 
 Under a BSA agreement, NTN has agreed to provide exclusive administrative, management and other business support services to Online Care Group. The non-medical functions and services NTN provides under the BSA include the maintenance of medical, billing and accounting records, legal, human resources and the administration of quality assurance, and administration of a risk management program. Additionally, NTN is required to maintain medical malpractice insurance for covered providers as well as appropriate general liability, directors and officers, workers compensation and employment practices insurance. The BSA has a 10-year term (with 5-year automatic renewals thereafter), expiring in February 2023 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following a material default under the BSA by the non-terminating party. NTN, in turn, has subcontracted all of its responsibilities under the BSA between NTN and Online Care Group to Amwell, under substantially similar terms. 
 Amwell has signed direct BSAs with the other AMG affiliated entities to provide similar administrative and management services for a fixed fee. 
 U.S. Government Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations. 
 12


In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities loosened or removed a number of regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period.
 We believe that a return to the status quo would not have a material negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during 2020. Each of these agreements has a defined term and virtually none allow for immediate termination for convenience by the customer in question. For many health care companies engaging in telehealth, the most significant potential concern about returning to the status quo is that restrictions on the reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries, such as when a patient presents to a medical professional from a rural area or at a clinical site, could be re-imposed. 
 Currently, AMG, the Company’s affiliated provider group, does not perform these kind of consultations. As such, all patients who experienced a first-time visit with AMG during the pandemic would be able to continue using the platform. In light of that, we do not believe that the visit volume on our platform or visit revenue will materially decrease based on a return to the status quo from a regulatory perspective. In fact, we believe that such a return would benefit the Company as the renewed enforcement of HIPAA regulations may force many marginal telehealth platforms out of the marketplace, thereby lessening our competition. 
 Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines 
 The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretation. 
 Physicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable, or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil, criminal or administrative penalties. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the U.S.; Fee Splitting 
 We contract with physicians or physician owned professional associations and professional corporations to provide access to our platform to them and their patients. We have entered into management services contracts with AMG affiliated entities pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and management services, and they pay us for those services via management and other service fees. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas and California, that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and that are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing a physician’s professional judgment. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. 
 State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or administrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.

U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Federal Stark Law 
 We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients for “designated health services” such as laboratory and radiology services that are furnished at an entity if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $172,137 for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
 We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $104,330 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of more than $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the OIG has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. 
 Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter, it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws. 
 False Claims Act 
 Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,803 to $23,607 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. 
 14


Foreign and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Several states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also adopted or may adopt similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by Medicaid programs and any third party payer, including commercial insurers or to any payer, including to funds paid out of pocket by a patient. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payers of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payers as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs. 
 In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts, and statutory or common law fraud. 
 U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws 
 There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. AMG, our health system clients, and our health plan clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. We are a business associate of our covered entity clients when we are working on behalf of our covered entity clients including our affiliated medical groups and also when we are providing technology services to those clients via our telehealth platform. As a business associate, we are also directly regulated by HIPAA and are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to our covered entity clients through written business associate agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with HIPAA. Failure to comply with these contractual agreements could lead to loss of clients, contractual liability to our clients, and direct action by HHS, including monetary penalties. 
 Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Our management responsibilities to AMG include assisting it with its obligations under HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. HIPAA also requires a business associate to notify its covered entity clients of breaches by the business associate. 
 15


State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts. 
 HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards for electronic transactions that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. On January 16, 2009, HHS released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by HIPAA must implement ICD 10 for medical coding on October 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended to October 1, 2015 and is now in effect. 
 Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but, unlike HIPAA, some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. 
 In addition to HIPAA and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security acts or practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting. The FTC and states’ attorneys general have brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act and similar state laws. 
 In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials and provide credit monitoring services and/or other relevant services to impacted individuals. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our clients who are covered entities, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others. 
 International Regulation 
 We expect over time to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through both organic growth and acquisitions. In such a case, our international operations will be subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which became effective in May 2018 across the EU), data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the UK Bribery Act. 
 The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. We also are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and the DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. We have internal control policies and procedures and conduct training and compliance programs for our employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. 
 16


We also are subject to regulation by OFAC. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 Our Amwell Family
 Our Amwell employees are our most valuable asset. They carry out our mission through the invaluable work they do every day to support our providers, clients, and patients. Our corporate values guide our strategy, policies, and day-to-day practices to support our employees. These values create the foundation for building a great organization focused on hiring and developing exceptional talent.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 812 employees, including 289 in research and development and 185 in sales and marketing, of which 96% are based in the United States, and 4% in Israel. 
 We continually seek ways to grow, develop and retain an exceptionally talented workforce. We build upon our “One Team” core value to create and enhance our range of programs to increase engagement and employee resources. We support our employees through competitive total rewards programs, including offering our own suite of products. We offer full access to all telehealth services to our employees and their immediate family members.  
 We offer programs and initiatives that improve employee engagement and enhance the way we work together. We listen to our employees and implement initiatives to meet their needs. Specifically, this year we expanded executive training and manager training on fostering an inclusive workforce. In addition, we offered Conscious Inclusion and related D&I trainings to our employees. Allowing our employees to voice perspectives and share feedback has increased our ability to support engagement and build a strong and inclusive workforce. We continue to have a strong focus on Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion in 2021 through education and training as well as our grassroots D&I committee that fosters opportunities to educate and champion topics critical to our workforce.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our patent portfolio consists of approximately 40 patents and 7 pending patent applications related to our software and technology. The Company does not currently consider any of its patents to be material to its business. We continue to submit patent applications for new inventions and ideas the Company develops as well as monitor competitors in an effort to protect our intellectual property. 
 We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality, agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property arising in the ordinary course of our business, including oppositions to our applications for trademarks or patents, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights, and claims of intellectual property infringement. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Seasonality
 Visit volumes typically follow the annual flu season, rising during quarter four and quarter one and falling in the summer months. The impact of COVID-19 has caused an increase in the volume of visits in the late spring and summer of 2020, the future impact of COVID-19 on seasonality is unknown as there could be additional surges and demand on telehealth visits. While we sell to and implement our solutions to clients year-round, we experience some seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with our clients and when we launch our solutions to members. We typically enter into a higher percentage of agreements with new clients, as well as renewal agreements with existing clients, in the first and fourth quarters. Regardless of when the agreement is entered into, we can typically complete client implementation in an average of approximately three months.
