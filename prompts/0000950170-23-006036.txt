The Company operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank (the “Bank” or “CapStar”). CapStar provides traditional banking and other financial services through its 23 bank locations and 397 associates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total assets of $3.1 billion, total deposits of $2.7 billion, total net loans of $2.3 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $354.2 million.
 
The primary products and services provided by CapStar are:
 •Commercial Banking – CapStar offers a full range of banking services to businesses and professionals, including deposit and savings accounts, treasury management services, as well as financing for commercial and industrial needs, owner-occupied real estate, construction and land development, and non-owner-occupied income producing real estate some of which are sold in the secondary market.

 •Wealth Management – CapStar specializes in helping individuals develop sound retirement strategies.
 
Our strategy is to maintain broadly diversified loan and deposit portfolios in terms of the type of loan product, the type of client and the industries in which our business clients are engaged.
Commercial and industrial loans consist of loans to small to mid-sized businesses and other legal entities. Commercial and industrial loans are reliant on the ability of a borrower’s cash flow from operations to repay the loan. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured with the collateral securing these loans being inventory, receivables, and equipment. Lending products include commercial loans, business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and medium sized businesses. As of December 31, 2022, commercial and industrial loans totaled $496.3 million or 21.5% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Commercial real estate loans consist of owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans having many of the characteristics of commercial and industrial loans with the primary source of repayment reliant on the ability of the borrower’s cash flow to repay the loan. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans finance well-managed income producing properties supported by a history of profitable operations and cash flows, and proven operating stability. As of December 31, 2022, owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $246.1 million and $803.6 million or 10.6% and 34.7%, respectively, of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Residential real estate loans consist of loans to individuals secured by first priority liens for the purchase or refinance of a residence as well as first priority lien home equity loans which allow individuals to borrow against equity in their home. Residential mortgages primarily consist of three- and five-year adjustable-rate mortgages with amortization up to 30 years as well as longer-term fixed rate loans produced by our mortgage division with the intent to sell in the secondary market. Home equity loans include lines of credit as well as amortizing term loans on which may be first or second liens. As of December 31, 2022, residential real estate loans totaled $402.6 or 17.4% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Construction and land development loans consist of loans where the repayment is dependent on the successful completion and operation and/or sale of the related real estate project. Construction and land development loans include 1-4 family construction projects and commercial construction endeavors such as warehouses, apartments, office and retail space and land acquisition and development. As of December 31, 2022, construction and land development loans totaled $230.0 million or 9.9% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
Consumer loans consist of loans secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, certificates of deposit, other personal property, or in a limited case may be unsecured. As of December 31, 2022, consumer loans totaled $53.4 million or 2.3% of the Company’s loan portfolio.

Other loans consists of all loans not included in the classes of loans above and leases. As of December 31, 2022, other loans totaled $80.8 million or 3.5% of the Company’s loan portfolio.
CapStar’s underwriting guidelines are reviewed regularly and approved annually by our Board of Directors. Our underwriting process includes:
 •receipt of certain financial information, such as financial statements, tax returns and credit reports, to ensure that the potential borrower has sufficient recurring cash flow and liquidity to repay the loan;
 •identifying and evaluating all significant direct and contingent liabilities;
 •determination that the structure of the loan matches the underlying purpose of and repayment source for the loan, the potential borrower’s creditworthiness and the depreciable life of any collateral;
 •verification that the potential borrower has a demonstrated propensity to repay the loan/the borrower’s indebtedness/etc.; and
 •consideration of the value, liquidity and marketability of the potential borrower’s collateral.
 Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers and credit underwriters in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within our market. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ a tiered review of loan originations that may involve joint line and credit authorization, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors.
 Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the underwriting and risk identification processes are functioning properly. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Annually, we submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight.
Market Area and Competition
 CapStar operates in the community markets of Athens, Lawrenceburg/Waynesboro, and Manchester, Tennessee as well as the metropolitan markets of Asheville, North Carolina and Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Nashville, Tennessee which are included among the fastest growing nationally. The bank seeks business development and serves customers through a team of commercial relationship managers and its 23 banking locations. The financial services industry is highly competitive and each of these markets has a significant presence of other financial service providers. In particular, we estimate that, as of June 30, 2022, Tennessee included more than 80 financial institutions with over $118 billion in deposits. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, internet-based banks, and out-of-market banks that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We expect to continue to face increasing competition.
Expansion and Acquisitions
 In January of 2020, the Company announced its first out of market expansion hiring a Knoxville commercial banking team. In October of 2021, the Company announced the hiring of a Chattanooga commercial banking team. In July of 2022, the Company announced its expansion to Asheville, NC through the hiring of a commercial banking team. During this period, the Company also hired additional commercial and retail bankers within its existing markets. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company announced the hiring of an experienced financial professional to expand the SBA division.
 On July 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of FCB Corporation (“FCB”), the bank holding company for the First National Bank of Manchester. The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of

FCB for approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock. At the time of acquisition, Manchester had four banking locations throughout middle Tennessee. The operations of Manchester are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020.
On July 1, 2020, the Company also completed the acquisition of the Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”). The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of BOW for approximately 0.7 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of acquisition, BOW had six banking locations throughout Southern Tennessee. The operations of BOW are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 397 total employees. As a service-oriented business, our long-term success depends on our people and we are committed to taking a multi-dimensional approach to talent and culture. Our people and culture are critical to the Company’s long-term success.

As such, our talent vision and strategy focus on:
 •Enabling talent and performance management that generates career opportunities and creates future leaders of the organization. 
 •Empathy towards others that gives us a unique understanding and ability to provide internal and external service excellence.
 •Supporting a healthy work-life balance by offering generous paid time off for vacation (four weeks per year), holidays (including birthday), and sick leave. 
 •Delivering a competitive compensation package, including medical, dental and vision benefits; life, disability, and long-term care insurance; and 401(k) employer contribution.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions ("TDFI"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitizations and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.
Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends.
This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective primary federal regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and

performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.
Acquisition of Banks
The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before:
•acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control 5% or more of the bank’s voting shares; 
 •acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or 
 •merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. 
 Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.
Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years.
Change in Bank Control
Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to

control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company.
Permitted Activities
Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities:
 •banking or managing or controlling banks; and 
 •any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 
 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include:
 •factoring accounts receivable; 
 •making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing; 
 •leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; 
 •operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; 
 •engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law; 
 •financial and investment advisory activities; 
 •discount securities brokerage activities; 
 •underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; 
 •providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; 
 •performing selected data processing services and support services; 
 •acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and 
 •performing selected insurance underwriting activities. 
 The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Support of Subsidiary Institutions
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank.
Repurchase or Redemption of Securities
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions.

Bank Regulation and Supervision
Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank.
Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations.
Branching
Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states.
FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments
The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor, per ownership category. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the assessment rate is determined by the risk category assigned to an institution based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations which are designed to measure risk, with riskier institutions paying a higher assessment rate. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. As of December 31, 2022 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”
 Interest Rate Limitations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.

Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions
Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including:
•the Federal Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 •the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; 
 •the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; 
 •the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
 •the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors; 
 •the Service Members Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; 
 •the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, governing the disclosure and safeguarding of sensitive non-public personal information of our clients; 
 •the Right to Financial Privacy Act, imposing a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 •the Electronic Funds Transfer Act governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and clients’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 
 •the rules and regulations of the CFPB and various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 
 Capital Adequacy
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under the adopted regulations, the Basel member central bank and federal bank regulators approved the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are as follows: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital.
Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization maintaining capital levels in excess of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. With the capital conservation buffer fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds.

Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2022, our bank qualified for the “well capitalized” category.
Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.
An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new markets or product offerings, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval.
The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.
Liquidity
Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions.
Payment of Dividends
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs.
The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years.
Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates.
 Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate.
Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.
Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
Single Borrower Credit Limits
Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly.
Commercial Real Estate Concentration
In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2022, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 262% of total capital.
Privacy
Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers.
Consumer Credit Reporting
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things:
 •requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, to place a fraud alert in the consumer’s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; 
 •requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; 
 •requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers in certain circumstances; and 
 •limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes. 
 Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation
Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements.
Overdraft Fees
Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions.
The Dodd-Frank Act
As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it.
A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank.
•The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to enumerated consumer financial protection laws over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer financial protection laws by their primary federal regulator. 
 •The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of new consumer protections, including limitations, subject to exceptions, on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower’s “ability to repay” a residential mortgage loan. Final rules implementing these latter statutory requirements became effective in 2014. 
 •The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. 
 •The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires national securities exchanges to require listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. 
 The Volcker Rule
On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits any “banking entity” from engaging in proprietary trading or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds (i.e., hedge funds or private equity funds). In addition, the Volcker Rule requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule.

On October 8, 2019, the agencies finalized revisions to the Volcker Rule that, among other things, simplified and streamlined compliance requirements for banking entities that do not have significant trading activities, while banking entities with significant trading activity would become subject to more stringent compliance requirements. Further, the revisions to the Volcker Rule implemented Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which amended the definition of “banking entity” to exclude certain community banks from the definition of insured depository institution, the general result of which was to exclude such banks and their affiliates and subsidiaries from the scope of the Volcker Rule. Under EGRRCPA, a community bank and its affiliates are generally excluded from the definition of “banking entity” if the bank and all companies that control the bank have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets. These revisions became effective on January 1, 2020, with a required compliance date of January 1, 2021.
 Limitations on Incentive Compensation
In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal imposes principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions are prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal also imposes certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve reserves the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size.
Cybersecurity
 Cybersecurity is a high-priority item for legislators and regulators at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally. State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision. Such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. These requirements, including state regulatory rules such as the detailed and extensive cybersecurity rules issued in 2016 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, may cause us to incur significant additional compliance costs and in some cases may impact our growth prospects. Additionally, if we fail to observe federal or state regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
The Company has an Information Technology (IT) Steering Committee comprised of internal managers representing various divisions of the Company. The Committee oversees IT strategic and investment priorities and the Company’s Information Security Program. The Committee regularly reports to the Risk Committee of the Board through distribution of meeting minutes and other presentations and communication, including a comprehensive overview of the Company’s cyber and information security program annually.
In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, as attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and complexity, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Financial expenditures may also be required to meet regulatory changes in the information security and cybersecurity domains. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks

are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.
Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLBA requires us to disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA, financial institutions, including our bank, will be required to comply with such state law. Other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information.
Proposed or new legislation and regulations may also significantly increase our compliance cost and impede our ability to grow into specific markets. There are a number of proposals that have either recently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. In addition, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In the event of a data breach, there are mandatory reporting requirements that may hamper the ability to fully assess an incident prior to external reporting. We must maintain awareness of additional legal and regulatory requirements that apply to existing and future subsets of the customer base for protection against legal, reputational, and financial risk due to compliance failures.
