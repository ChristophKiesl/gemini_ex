Information set forth in Items 1A and 2 below are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.
 
Introduction
 
Hecla Mining Company and its subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to the U.S. and worldwide since 1891 (in this report, “we” or “our” or “us” refers to Hecla Mining Company and our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise). We discover, acquire and develop mines and other mineral interests and produce and market (i) concentrates containing silver, gold (in the case of Greens Creek), lead and zinc, (ii) carbon material containing silver and gold, and (iii) unrefined doré containing silver and gold.  In doing so, we intend to manage our business activities in a safe, environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner.
 
The lead, zinc and bulk concentrates and carbon material we produce are sold to custom smelters, metal traders and third-party processors, and the unrefined doré we produce is sold to refiners or further refined before sale of the metals to traders.  We are organized and managed in five segments that encompass our operating units: the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, San Sebastian and Nevada Operations units.

Metals Prices
 
Our operating results are substantially dependent upon the prices of silver, gold, lead and zinc, which can fluctuate widely. The volatility of such prices is illustrated in the following table, which sets forth our average realized prices and the high, low and average daily closing market prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc for each of the last three years. The sources for the market prices are the London Market Fixing prices from the London Bullion Market Association for silver and gold and the Cash Official prices from the London Metals Exchange for lead and zinc.

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of silver, gold, lead and zinc, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors – A substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for information on a number of the factors that can impact prices of the metals we produce. Our average realized prices for silver and gold were higher, while the average realized prices for zinc and lead were lower, in 2020 compared to 2019 and in 2019 compared to 2018. Market metal price trends are a significant factor in our operating and financial performance.  We are unable to predict fluctuations in prices for metals and have limited control over the timing of our concentrate shipments which impacts our realized prices. However, we utilize financially-settled forward contracts for the metals we produce with the objective of managing the exposure to changes in prices of those metals contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement. In addition, at times we utilize a similar program to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead (but not silver and gold) contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments.  In June 2019, we also began utilizing financially-settled put option contracts to manage the exposure of our forecasted future gold and silver sales to potential declines in market prices for those metals. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our base and precious metal forward and put option contract programs.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
 
Products and Segments
 
Our segments are differentiated by geographic region. We produce zinc, lead and bulk flotation concentrates at our Greens Creek unit and lead and zinc flotation concentrates at our Lucky Friday unit, each of which we sell to custom smelters and metal traders. The flotation concentrates produced at our Greens Creek and Lucky Friday units contain payable silver, zinc and lead, and at Greens Creek they also contain payable gold. At Greens Creek, we also produce gravity concentrate containing payable silver, gold and lead. Unrefined bullion (doré) is produced from the gravity concentrate by a third-party processor, and shipped to a refiner before sale of the metals to precious metal traders. We also produce unrefined gold and silver bullion bars (doré), loaded carbon and precipitates at our Casa Berardi, San Sebastian and Nevada Operations units, which are shipped to refiners before sale of the metals to precious metal traders. At times, we sell loaded carbon and precipitates directly to refiners. Payable metals are those included in our products which we are paid for by smelters, metal traders and refiners. Our segments as of December 31, 2020 included:

• | The Greens Creek unit located on Admiralty Island, near Juneau, Alaska. Greens Creek is 100% owned and has been in production since 1989, with a temporary care and maintenance period from April 1993 through July 1996.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Lucky Friday unit located in northern Idaho. Lucky Friday is 100% owned and has been a producing mine for us since 1958. Unionized employees at Lucky Friday were on strike from mid-March 2017 until early January 2020, resulting in limited production during that time. Re-staffing of the mine and ramp-up activities have been substantially completed, and the mine has returned to full production starting in the fourth quarter of 2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Casa Berardi unit located in the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, Canada. Casa Berardi is 100% owned and was acquired on June 1, 2013 with the purchase of all issued and outstanding common shares of Aurizon Mines Ltd. ("Aurizon"). Aurizon had operated and produced from the Casa Berardi mine since late 2006.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The San Sebastian unit located in the state of Durango, Mexico. San Sebastian is 100% owned, and had previously produced for us from both underground mines and open pits at various dates from 2001. Mine production was completed in the third quarter of 2020, with milling of remaining ore completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have continued to advance additional exploration targets near our operations at San Sebastian.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Nevada Operations unit located in northern Nevada. Nevada Operations is 100% owned and was acquired on July 20, 2018 with the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Klondex Mines Ltd ("Klondex"). Nevada Operations consists of four land packages in northern Nevada totaling approximately 110 square miles and containing operating or previously-operating mines with a history of high-grade gold production: Fire Creek, Hollister and Midas. As discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations - The Nevada Operations Segment, in the second quarter of 2019, we ceased development to access new production areas at our Nevada Operations until completion of studies and test work, including the results of the mining and processing of a bulk sample of refractory ore through a third party ore processing agreement in the first quarter of 2021, resulting in, among other changes, an anticipated suspension of production in the first half of 2021.

Governmental Regulation
 
The following is a summary of governmental regulation compliance areas which we believe are significant to our business and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, earnings and/or competitive position.
Health and Safety
 
We are subject to the regulations of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) in the United States, the Commission of Labor Standards, Pay Equity and Occupational Health and Safety in Quebec, and the Mexico Ministry of Economy and Mining, and work with these agencies to address issues outlined in any investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our safety practices. We strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance, and attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness. Achieving and maintaining compliance with regulations will be challenging and may increase our operating costs. See Human Capital - Health and Safety below and Item 1A. Risk Factors – We face substantial governmental regulation, including the Mine Safety and Health Act, various environmental laws and regulations and the 1872 Mining Law.
 
Environmental
 
Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations at the federal and state/provincial level. Compliance with environmental regulations, and litigation based on environmental laws and regulations, involves significant costs and can threaten existing operations or constrain expansion opportunities. Mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. We have over $180 million of financial assurances, primarily in the form of surety bonds, for reclamation company-wide. We anticipate approximately $6 million in expenditures in 2021 for idle property management and environmental permit compliance. We also plan to invest approximately $3 million in 2021 in on-going reclamation works at the former Troy Mine in Montana; the projected remaining cost for reclamation at the site is included in our accrued reclamation and closure costs liability. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We face substantial governmental regulation, including the Mine Safety and Health Act, various environmental laws and regulations and the 1872 Mining Law; Our operations are subject to complex, evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations; Compliance with environmental regulations, and litigation based on such regulations, involves significant costs and can threaten existing operations or constrain expansion opportunities; Our environmental and asset retirement obligations may exceed the provisions we have made; and New federal and state laws, regulations and initiatives could impact our operations.

Licenses, Permits and Claims/Concessions
 
We are required to obtain various licenses and permits to operate our mines and conduct exploration and reclamation activities. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are required to obtain governmental permits and other approvals in order to conduct mining operations. The El Toro area at San Sebastian, the Rock Creek and Montanore projects, and our planned open pits at Casa Berardi can only be developed if we are successful in obtaining the necessary permits. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are required to obtain governmental permits and other approvals in order to conduct mining operations and Legal challenges could prevent the Rock Creek or Montanore projects from ever being developed. In addition, our operations and exploration activities at our Casa Berardi and San Sebastian units are conducted pursuant to claims or concessions granted by the host government, and otherwise are subject to claims renewal and minimum work commitment requirements, which are subject to certain political risks associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks.
 
Taxes and Royalties
 
We are subject to various taxes and government royalties in the jurisdictions where we operate, including those specific to mining activities. These include: federal income taxes; state/provincial income taxes; county property taxes and sales and use tax in the U.S.; goods and services tax in Canada; value added tax in Mexico; mining-specific taxes in Alaska, Nevada and Quebec; and mining royalties in Mexico. Accrual and payment of taxes and accounting for deferred taxes can involve significant estimates and assumptions and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Tax rates and the calculations of taxes can change significantly and are influenced by changes in political administrations and other factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise; Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and other items is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income; Our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks; and We face substantial governmental regulation, including the Mine Safety and Health Act, various environmental laws and regulations and the 1872 Mining Law. Also, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on income taxes.
 
Physical Assets
 
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization and expansion of equipment and facilities and to develop new ore reserves. At December 31, 2020, the book value of our properties, plants, equipment and mineral interests, net of accumulated depreciation, was approximately $2.3 billion.  For more information see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption.  However, such insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, and there can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance.
 
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,600 people, of which approximately 900 were employed in the United States, 650 in Canada, and 50 in Mexico. The vast majority of our employees are full-time. Approximately 15% of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
One of our greatest resources is our people, with the attraction, development and retention of talent critical to delivering our business strategy. Key areas of focus for us include:
 
    8 

  

Health and Safety
 
The safety and health of our employees is of paramount importance, and we go to great lengths to keep employees safe. We continue to invest in effective ways to operate our mines more safely. Our goal is to achieve world-class safety and health performance by promoting a deeply rooted value-based culture of safety and utilizing technology and innovation to continually improve safe operations. We know that instilling the behavior of safety awareness is fundamental to making our workplace as safe as possible. So, we invest in our people with training and the latest technology and workforce development programs that focus on safety first. All employees receive training that complies with or exceeds the applicable safety and health regulations as set by the governing body in the jurisdiction in which each operation is located. As part of our commitment to safety, we track a variety of safety performance indicators, including injuries, near misses, observations, and equipment damages. Our goal is to reduce safety incidents and improve upon the previous year’s performance. Company-wide, our All Injury Frequency Rate ("AIFR"), calculated as the number of incidents in the period multiplied by 200,000 hours and divided by the number of hours worked in the period, dropped 70% from 2014 to 2019. In 2020, we reduced our AIFR by 24% to 1.22, the lowest level in our history and 46% below the U.S. national average for MSHA's "metal and nonmetal" category.
 
During fiscal year 2020, we launched a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak and temporarily suspended operations at our Casa Berardi mine, starting at the end of March, and at our San Sebastian mine, in early April, due to government mandated closures. Those sites returned to full operations in mid-April and early-May, respectively. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures, including implementing very detailed corporate and site-specific plans in February and early March 2020. Our plans included being flexible and quickly adapting to changing circumstances and government mandates. Even before mining was deemed an essential industry in the United States, we implemented procedures and policies to help keep our workers safe and ensure our supply chain, such as limiting site access, adopting social distancing, enhanced cleaning practices, implementing temperature testing, and quarantining protocols. We also commenced remote work protocols for those employees who wished to work remotely and could effectively do so. We took these actions to secure the safety of our employees, our vendors, and the communities in which our team members live and work, and to adhere to Center for Disease Control recommendations.
 
Compensation and Benefits
 
We are often among the largest private-sector employers in the communities in which we operate. We strive to provide a compensation and benefits package that succeeds in attracting, motivating, and retaining employees.  For many decades, we have been at the forefront of offering competitive wages and among the highest valued benefits in the communities where we operate.  The competitive wage and benefit package has been key to the strong retention of our employees. In addition to competitive base wages, we offer retirement benefits, health insurance benefits, incentive plans, and paid time off.  We believe our retirement benefits in particular, which include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, set us apart from many other employers.
Retention and Employee Development
 
A key element of our employee retention has been our culture. Maintaining a work environment in which our employees are provided the tools they need to grow and succeed and supporting the communities in which our mines and offices are located has been part of our culture for over a century. Our employees benefit from company-sponsored health and wellness programs that cover education, health interventions and disease management. Our responsibility to ensure a safe workplace extends to providing opportunities for employee wellness. In combination with the Hecla Foundation, we support employees both at the work site and in the communities in which we operate.
 
We are committed to hiring talented people, developing effective leaders and providing an inclusive workplace. The mining workforce of the future, like all industries, will see a continual change in the jobs and skill sets required as we adopt new technologies and make our workplace safer and more efficient. We are also committed to helping employees update their skills. For example, we are working with North Idaho College’s Career Training Center to develop a training curriculum to update the worker skill sets necessary to meet the changing mining workforce dynamic. In addition, we have long supported the Pathways to Mining Careers program, a career training partnership with the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau. We also offer a reimbursement program to assist with educational expenses for employees who are interested in furthering their education. Advanced education can improve job performance and increase advancement opportunities for the employee, while providing flexibility to our company by increasing the employee’s knowledge base and skill set.

Annual employee surveys are conducted to gauge employee concerns and morale. The results of the surveys, and any responsive measures, are shared with our board of directors. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning reviews are conducted periodically across all business areas, and our training programs are adapted accordingly. The CEO, senior level company leadership and board of directors regularly review top talent across the organization. Creating more opportunities for women, indigenous people and minorities are among our priorities for employee development. We also strive to maintain an inclusive workplace, and provide periodic training to employees to help meet that goal. Our employees are required to abide by our Code of Conduct, which is available on our website, to promote the conduct of our business in a consistently legal and ethical manner. Among other provisions, the Code of Conduct reflects that it is our policy and practice not to discriminate against any employee because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, or physical or other disability. We expect our leaders to set the example by being positive role models and good mentors for our employees.
 
We employ our Vice President-Human Resources who is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. The position is an executive-level position to reflect the priority we place on utilizing our human capital resources to meet our business strategy.
