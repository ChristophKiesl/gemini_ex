ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients by tackling key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. Our small molecule drug candidates are directed against an important family of enzymes called kinases, known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We use our deep understanding of kinase biology together with a proprietary chemistry library to purposefully design compounds that maintain kinases in a "switched off" or inactivated conformation. These investigational therapies comprise tumor-targeted agents designed to address therapeutic resistance causing mutations and immuno-targeted agents designed to control the activation of immunokinases that suppress critical immune system regulators, such as macrophages. We have used our platform to develop a diverse pipeline of tumor-targeted and immuno-targeted drug candidates designed to improve outcomes for patients with cancer by improving the quality, rate, and/or durability of their responses to treatment that includes three clinical-stage, one preclinical-stage, and one research-stage program. We wholly own all of our drug candidates with the exception of a development and commercialization out-license agreement for our lead drug candidate, ripretinib, in the Greater China region.
In December 2019, we submitted a NDA to the FDA for ripretinib, for the treatment of patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Our NDA is based on positive results from our first Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST patients, for whom there are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. other than avapritinib which is approved for GIST patients with PDGFRα exon 18 mutations only (estimated to be approximately 6% of all patients with newly-diagnosed GIST). In August 2019, we announced top-line results from INVICTUS, including that the study achieved its primary endpoint of improved progression free survival (PFS) compared to placebo as determined by blinded independent central radiologic review using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. In February 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for ripretinib for the treatment of patients with fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, granted priority review and set an action date of August 13, 2020, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).
The NDA is being reviewed under the RTOR pilot program, which according to the FDA, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. In October 2019, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for ripretinib for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. BTD is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). In December 2019, we filed an NDS with Health Canada, and an AUS MAA with the TGA in Australia, for ripretinib in advanced GIST, under Project Orbis. According to the FDA, Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. Both the NDS and the AUS MAA have received priority review. Acceptance in the RTOR pilot program and Project Orbis initiative does not guarantee or influence approvability of our NDA, NDS, and AUS MAA for ripretinib in advanced GIST, which are subject to the standard benefit-risk evaluation by the FDA, and the review standards of Health Canada and TGA, and we may not derive any benefit from inclusion in these programs, including, but not limited to, a more efficient review process. These programs are not formal regulatory pathways and may be changed, suspended, or halted at any time.
We are actively engaged in commercial preparations to support the potential U.S. launch of ripretinib, if approved, for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. We expect to file a marketing authorisation application (EU MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union (EU) for ripretinib in advanced GIST in the second half of 2020, and are exploring whether to partner for, or build our own, European go-to-market capabilities, if approved. In June 2019, we entered into a License Agreement (the Zai License Agreement), with an affiliate of Zai pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ripretinib, including certain follow-on compounds (the Licensed Products), in Greater China.
In addition, we are studying ripretinib in our global pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, in second-line GIST patients, comparing ripretinib to sunitinib. As of February 14, 2020, we had 111 sites open for enrollment of INTRIGUE in 20 countries. We expect to complete enrollment of INTRIGUE in the second half of 2020. We also have an ongoing Phase 1 trial studying 
ripretinib in patients with different stages of GIST following treatment with at least one systemic anticancer therapy, such as imatinib, as well as in patients with systemic mastocytosis, other than indolent systemic mastocytosis (such subgroups of systemic mastocytosis are herein referred to as SM), and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), germ cell cancer, penile cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas, as well as a cohort for GIST and other solid tumors with renal impairment. We expect to report data from one or more of these expansion cohorts in the second half of 2020.
Beyond ripretinib, we are developing two other clinical-stage drug candidates, DCC-3014 and rebastinib, which target the macrophage tumor microenvironment.
DCC-3014 is an investigational, orally administered, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of CSF1R, a kinase that controls the survival and function of certain immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). We are currently studying DCC-3014 in a Phase 1 dose escalation study that includes patients with advanced malignancies as well as patients with a type of tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), known as diffuse-type TGCT. The dose escalation Phase 1 study is designed to determine a Phase 2 dose for the expansion portion of the study. During 2019, we announced positive, preliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation Phase 1 study with DCC-3014 in patients with advanced malignancies and preliminary data from three initial patients diagnosed with diffuse-type TGCT. To explore the potential of DCC-3014 in this target population, we intend to continue to enroll TGCT patients in the dose escalation study, and, in the second half of 2020, provide a data update on TGCT patients. Subject to favorable results from the dose escalation study, in the second half of 2020, we intend to determine a Phase 2 dose for, and initiate, the expansion portion of the study with DCC-3014 in patients with TGCT. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to study DCC-3014 in advanced malignancies in combination with other therapies, including immuno-oncology (I/O) therapies.
Rebastinib is an investigational, orally administered, potent, and selective inhibitor of TIE2 kinase, which plays an important role in regulating tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and immunotolerance. We are currently studying rebastinib in two Phase 1b/2 studies in combination with chemotherapy, one with paclitaxel and one with carboplatin. In October 2018, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We expect to present Phase 1b/2 data from this study in the second half of 2020. In January 2019, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In January 2020, we selected a Phase 2 dose for, and activated, Part 2 of this Phase 1b/2 study in combination with carboplatin and we expect to present data from this study in the second half of 2020.
In addition to our clinical-stage programs, we are conducting preclinical IND-enabling studies with DCC-3116, a small molecule ULK kinase inhibitor discovered using our novel switch control inhibitor platform. DCC-3116 is designed to inhibit autophagy, a key tumor survival mechanism in cancer cells, by inhibiting the ULK kinase, which has been shown to be the initiating factor that activates autophagy. Subject to favorable IND-enabling studies and FDA acceptance of our IND, currently expected to be filed in the second half of 2020, we intend to develop DCC-3116 for the potential treatment of RAS mutant cancers in combination with inhibitors of downstream RAS effector targets including RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors as well as with direct inhibitors of mutant RAS.
We believe our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform, supported by our experienced management team, enables us to develop advanced, differentiated kinase inhibitors that may provide significant benefits to cancer patients. We continue to work on potential new drug candidates for undisclosed targets.
Kinase inhibitors have become an important class of cancer therapies. Despite the success of this drug class, there remains a significant opportunity for advanced kinase inhibitors that address the shortcomings of current therapies, including limited durability of response caused by development of resistance mutations and off-target toxicities that limit dose and, consequently, target inhibition. In addition, currently approved kinase inhibitors target fewer than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases. There remains a substantial opportunity to develop novel inhibitors that target therapeutically relevant kinases.
Our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform combines our deep insight into the biology of kinases with our library of drug-like compounds that we designed to interact with a specific region of the kinase called the switch pocket. The transformation of a kinase from a switched-off, or inactivated, state to a switched-on, or activated, state is dependent upon the interaction of one region of the kinase called the activation switch with another region called the switch pocket. The interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket is a common mechanism among all kinases; however, the molecular structure of the activation switch and the switch pocket varies among kinases allowing for the rational design of molecules that inhibit a specific kinase or specific kinases.
Our drug candidates directly target the conformation-controlling switch that kinases rely on for activation and inhibit the kinase from switching on. We believe that no kinase inhibitors on the market or active in clinical development directly target the switch pocket region. By using our proprietary approach to target the switch pocket, we believe we can design inhibitors that are more broadly active against the target kinase, covering both wild-type, or non-mutant, and mutant forms, or that are spectrum-selective against several chosen kinases, all while minimizing off-target toxicity. We believe that our drug candidates may contribute to higher activity than currently available kinase inhibitors even upon accumulation of mutations that would render the kinase resistant to other kinase inhibitors. Our drug candidates bind directly into the switch pocket at the site where the activation switch binds. As a result, the dual inhibitory mechanism of action of our platform provides broad in vitro inhibition of KIT and PDGFRα kinase activity, including wild type and multiple primary and secondary mutations.
We believe the results observed in patients treated with ripretinib provides strong evidence of our ability to discover and develop novel potential medicines to meet unmet medical needs using our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform. We designed ripretinib to inhibit the full spectrum of the known mutant or amplified KIT and PDGFRα kinases that drive cancers such as GIST and believe the positive results from both the Phase 1 study and Phase 3 INVICTUS study demonstrate ripretinib's differentiated profile. We believe our rapid clinical development of ripretinib, in just over four years from initiation of the Phase 1 study until the filing of the NDA, highlights our drug development capabilities that we believe will benefit our continued development of ripretinib as well as the development of our other clinical and research-stage programs.
We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the discovery, development, and commercialization of cancer therapeutics, including in senior roles at leading pharmaceutical companies. We are supported by our board of directors and specialized scientific advisory boards, who contribute their deep understanding of drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies and business development. We believe that our team is ideally positioned to leverage our highly differentiated platform to develop and commercialize advanced kinase inhibitors that will have significant benefit for cancer patients.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to develop and commercialize innovative drugs that address the serious unmet medical needs of cancer patients by addressing key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and/or durability of response to existing cancer therapies. The principal components of our strategy include:
•Rapidly seek approval for and commercialize our lead drug candidate, ripretinib, in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST. For ripretinib, we are initially targeting fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, a market opportunity where there is a high unmet need and no approved therapies other than avapritinib in the U.S. for GIST patients with PDGFRα exon 18 mutations only. In December 2019, we filed a NDA with the FDA for ripretinib for the treatment of advanced GIST based on the positive results from INVICTUS, our pivotal Phase 3 study in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, which met its primary endpoint. In February 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA, granted it priority review and set a PDUFA date of August 13, 2020. We intend to file an EU MAA with the EMA for the potential approval of ripretinib in advanced GIST during the second half of 2020. We have also commenced commercial preparations to support the potential launch of ripretinib for advanced GIST in the U.S., if approved.
•Expand the market opportunity for ripretinib by pursuing development in second-line GIST, and potentially SM, and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα. We are currently studying ripretinib in second-line GIST in INTRIGUE, a randomized, controlled, pivotal Phase 3 study comparing treatment with ripretinib to sunitinib, the currently approved standard of care in second-line GIST, and expect to complete enrollment in the second half of 2020. Based upon the activity observed in the expansion cohorts of our Phase 1 trial of ripretinib, and subject to favorable results, we may conduct additional pivotal studies in other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα. We believe that this approach offers an opportunity to significantly expand the commercial potential of ripretinib over time.
•Continue to develop DCC-3014 as a potential single agent therapy for the treatment of TGCT. DCC-3014 is currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with advanced solid malignancies, including TGCT. We announced preliminary data from the initial three diffuse-type TGCT patients in November 2019 at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society 2019 Annual Meeting (CTOS 2019), and in the second half of 2020 intend to update our dose escalation data in such patients, determine a Phase 2 dose, and subject to favorable results, enroll patients with TGCT in the expansion portion of the study. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to study DCC-3014 in advanced malignancies in combination with other therapies, including I/O therapies.
•Develop our macrophage immunokinase inhibitor rebastinib as a combination therapy. We believe kinase inhibitors have potential application as combination therapies with other anti-cancer therapies due to their anticipated synergistic effect with chemotherapies as well as other I/O therapies. Rebastinib is in two Phase 1b/2 
combination studies, one with paclitaxel and one with carboplatin, in patients with various solid tumors, and we expect to present data from these studies during the second half of 2020.
•Expand the application of our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform to advance additional drug candidates into clinical development, including DCC-3116, our ULK kinase inhibitor candidate. We believe there is a significant opportunity to utilize our kinase switch control inhibitor platform to discover and develop novel kinase inhibitor drug candidates that are directed to other tumor-targeted, immuno-targeted, and metabolism-targeted kinases critical to other mechanisms that contribute to the growth and spread of cancer. We believe that our platform allows us to identify drug candidates that address mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the clinical utility of many kinase inhibitors. We also believe that our drug candidates should exhibit greater resilience to resistance mutations, offer improved kinase selectivity, or both, compared to existing kinase inhibitors. For example, we are advancing the preclinical development of DCC-3116 and undertaking additional discovery efforts for undisclosed targets.
•Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates. We currently have worldwide rights to all of our drug candidates, with the exception of our out-license to Zai for the development and commercialization of ripretinib in Greater China. We intend to selectively evaluate strategic partnerships for our drug candidates with partners whose development and commercial capabilities complement our own. With respect to our macrophage-targeted immunokinase inhibitor drug candidates, and our ULK kinase preclinical candidate, where use in combination with other therapies will be an important driver of commercial value, we believe that strategic partnerships may be an effective means of developing and commercializing these classes of drug candidates.
•Establish capabilities to effectively commercialize our drug candidates outside the U.S., initially in Europe. We are exploring either building our own commercial capabilities in Europe and potentially other jurisdictions, where we do not partner with third parties such as Zai, to support the commercialization of ripretinib and our other drug candidates, if approved, or entering into additional out-licenses of ripretinib or our other drug candidates, or other distribution arrangements outside of the U.S.
Kinases and their Role in Cancer
Kinases play an important role in regulating cellular functions and the communication of cells with their environments. When dysregulated, kinases contribute to the development and progression of diseases including cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Despite the success of kinase inhibitors as a drug class, the therapeutic potential of individual kinase inhibitors has been limited by the development of drug resistance and by poor potency and selectivity profiles that lead to off-target toxicities or diminished efficacy. In addition, currently approved kinase inhibitors target fewer than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to develop novel kinase inhibitor therapies.
Within almost all kinases, a molecular control known as the activation switch governs whether the kinase is in the inactive or the active state. Most of the time kinases are in an inactive state and are triggered into the active state when they are needed to direct normal cellular functions. Mutations within kinases, particularly those that involve the activation switch region, can cause uncontrolled kinase signaling within the cell. In addition, kinases may acquire further mutations during treatment with traditional kinase inhibitors that confer resistance to these kinase inhibitors. We designate the region of the gene that encodes the kinase, or exon, when referring to a particular mutation. Kinase activity also may be amplified through the aberrant development of multiple copies of the relevant gene. These aggressively activated mutated or amplified kinases can drive rapid, uncontrolled growth and spread of tumors.
In addition to mutated kinases, certain kinases known as immunokinases also play a role in the development of cancer through the suppression of the immune system. Tumors suppress immune system cells, such as macrophages and T-cells, essentially shutting off their ability to identify and destroy cancer cells. For instance, tumors may suppress the immune system by sending a signal that activates an immunokinase in immune system cells. The activated kinase then initiates internal signaling within the immune system cells to suppress their function and prevent them from identifying and destroying the cancer cells. I/O is a recent development in cancer therapy, which uses advances in understanding of the control of the immune system to develop drugs that enhance the ability of immune system cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. Based on our preclinical data we believe inhibiting immunokinases has the potential to improve the rate and duration of response of other I/O therapies. Our immunokinase programs targeting tumoral macrophages also target inhibition of macrophage-mediated angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.
Our Approach: Kinase Switch Control Inhibitors
We created our diverse pipeline of drug candidates entirely in-house using our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform. We developed our platform based on our deep insight into the biology of kinases, which are regulated by control of their shape, or conformation. The transformation of a kinase from an inactive to an activated state is dependent upon the interaction of one region of the kinase called the activation switch with another region called the switch pocket. This activation switch mechanism is common among kinases. Some kinases also can be activated if the activity of an inhibitory switch that ordinarily blocks the ability of the activation switch to interact with the switch pocket is diminished or lost. Our drug candidates, which we refer to as kinase switch control inhibitors, directly interfere with the interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket and prevent kinase activation. While the interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket is common among kinases, the molecular structure of the activation switch and the switch pocket varies among kinases. We take advantage of this variation to design molecules that inhibit a specific kinase or kinases.
Our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform includes a library of drug-like, kinase switch control compounds. We have determined and assessed more than 100 co-crystal structures where our compounds are bound into the switch pocket of specific kinases. We use this information to identify and optimize candidate molecules that are specifically designed to interact with the switch pocket. By directly targeting the switch pocket, we believe we can design inhibitors that will be broadly active against the target kinase, covering both wild-type and many or all of the known mutant or amplified forms, or spectrum-selective towards several chosen kinases.
We believe that other kinase inhibitors on the market or active in clinical development do not directly target the switch pocket region and that we are the only biopharmaceutical company that is currently developing kinase switch control inhibitors. Using our kinase switch control inhibitor platform, we have developed a diverse pipeline of differentiated, orally administered drug candidates that include three clinical-stage, one preclinical-stage, and one research-stage program. Our kinase switch control inhibitors interact at a molecular level that is distinct from other kinase inhibitors. We believe our drug candidates may contribute to higher activity than currently available kinase inhibitors, including where multiple mutations confer resistance to these other kinase inhibitors. In addition, because our drug candidates bind directly into the switch pocket at the site where the activation switch binds, we believe mutations in the switch pocket region that could potentially diminish the activity of our drug candidates are likely to result in a weakly activated or inactive kinase.
The image below illustrates activation of the switch pocket and how our switch control inhibitors embed into the switch pocket thereby inhibiting switch activation.
While we believe that our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform offers the benefits described above, there are certain limitations of our platform, including its inability to control inhibition of certain kinases that interfere with access to the switch pocket, including cyclin dependent kinases and specific kinases in the MAPK family (MEK and ERK), which constitute less than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases as well as the inability of our laboratory assays to support high-throughput screening, resulting in limitations on the number of molecules that can be screened.
Our Drug Candidates
We are leveraging our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform to develop a pipeline of highly selective, potent small molecule drug candidates that directly inhibit activation of kinases implicated in the growth and spread of cancers. Our platform allows us to rapidly identify new drug candidates to enter preclinical development. We wholly own all of our drug candidates with the exception of a development and commercialization out-license agreement for our lead drug candidate, ripretinib, in the Greater China region, including the lead programs summarized in the following figure:
Ripretinib: A Broad spectrum KIT and PDGFRα Inhibitor
We are developing our lead drug candidate ripretinib, an orally administered kinase switch control inhibitor, for the treatment of GIST, SM, and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα where significant unmet medical need exists despite currently available therapies. While approved kinase inhibitors control certain initiating and drug resistance-causing mutations in KIT and PDGFRα, the kinases that drive disease progression in most GIST patients, these approved drugs fail to inhibit all known mutations. We designed ripretinib to improve the treatment of GIST patients by inhibiting the full spectrum of the known mutations in KIT and PDGFRα. Ripretinib is a KIT and PDGFRα switch control inhibitor that blocks initiating and resistance KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18 known to be present in GIST patients and the primary mutation in exon 17 that occurs in SM patients. Ripretinib similarly inhibits the primary initiating PDGFRα mutations occurring in exons 12 and 18 and also inhibits wild-type PDGFRα that is subject to amplification in cancers.
In December 2019, we submitted a NDA to the FDA, for our lead drug candidate, ripretinib, for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Our NDA submission is based on positive results from our first Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST patients, for whom there are currently no approved therapies other than avapritinib in the U.S. which is approved for GIST patients with PDGFRα exon 18 mutations only (estimated approximately 6% of all patients with newly-diagnosed GIST). In August 2019, we announced top-line results from INVICTUS, including that the study achieved its primary endpoint of improved PFS compared to placebo as determined by blinded independent central radiologic review using modified RECIST. In February 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for ripretinib for the treatment of patients with fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, granted priority review and set an action date of August 13, 2020 under the PDUFA.
The NDA submission is being reviewed under the RTOR pilot program, which, according to the FDA, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. Drugs considered for review under the RTOR pilot program must be likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted BTD for the same or other indications, and must have straight-forward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted. RTOR allows the FDA to review much of the data in a NDA earlier, before the applicant formally submits the complete application. This analysis of the pre-submission package gives the FDA and applicants an early opportunity to address data quality and potential 
review issues and allows the FDA to provide early feedback regarding the most effective way to analyze data to properly address key regulatory questions.
In October 2019, the FDA granted BTD for ripretinib for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. BTD is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
In June 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for ripretinib for the investigation of the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. The FDA's Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development of drugs intended to treat serious conditions and that have the potential to address unmet medical needs. A drug program with Fast Track status is afforded greater access to the FDA for the purpose of expediting the drug’s development, review, and potential approval. In addition, the Fast Track program allows for eligibility for Accelerated Approval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met, as well as for Rolling Review, which means that a company can submit completed sections of its NDA for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the NDA is completed before the entire application can be submitted for review. In December 2019, we filed an NDS with Health Canada, and an AUS MAA with the TGA in Australia, for ripretinib in advanced GIST, under Project Orbis. Project Orbis is an initiative of the FDA's OCE, and, according to the FDA, provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. According to the FDA, collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions, regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval. Both the NDS and the AUS MAA have received priority review.
Acceptance into the RTOR pilot program and Project Orbis initiative does not guarantee or influence approvability of our NDA, NDS, and AUS MAA for ripretinib in advanced GIST, which are subject to the standard benefit-risk evaluation by the FDA, and the review standards of Health Canada and TGA, and we may not derive any benefit from inclusion in these programs, including, but not limited to, a more efficient review process. These programs are not formal regulatory pathways and may be changed, suspended or halted at any time.
We are actively engaged in commercial preparations to support the potential U.S. launch of ripretinib for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, if approved. We expect to file an EU MAA with the EMA in the EU for ripretinib in advanced GIST in the second half of 2020, and we are exploring whether to partner, or build our own, European go-to-market capabilities to support a potential EU approval. In June 2019, we entered into the Zai License Agreement with Zai pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ripretinib, including certain follow-on compounds, in Greater China.
In addition, we are studying ripretinib in our global pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, in second-line GIST patients, comparing ripretinib to sunitinib. As of February 14, 2020, we had 111 sites open for enrollment of INTRIGUE in 20 countries. We expect to complete enrollment of INTRIGUE in the second half of 2020. We also have an ongoing Phase 1 trial studying ripretinib in patients with different stages of GIST, following treatment with at least one systemic anticancer therapy, such as imatinib, as well as in patients with SM, and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, NSCLC, germ cell cancer, penile cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas, as well as a cohort for GIST and other solid tumors with renal impairment. We expect to report data from one or more of these expansion cohorts in the second half of 2020.
Ripretinib Mechanism of Action
KIT and PDGFRα are dual switch kinases, each containing i) an auxiliary inhibitory switch encoded by KIT exon 11 or PDGFRα exon 12 and ii) a main activation loop switch within the kinase domain encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18 or PDGFRα exons 18 and 19. This dual switch mechanism carefully regulates cellular kinase activity by controlling kinase conformation in either an "on" or "off" position. Oncogenic kinase mutations predominantly function by disrupting one or more regulatory switch mechanisms, leading to dysregulated switch function and loss of normal, physiologic conformational control. Ripretinib is a novel switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed to broadly inhibit KIT and PDGFRα kinase signaling through a dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation, resulting in inhibition of downstream signaling and cell proliferation.
Ripretinib precisely and durably binds to both the switch pocket region and the activation loop to lock the kinase in the inactive "off" state. Portions of ripretinib mimic the inhibitory loop and occupy the switch pocket, thereby preventing the activation loop's entry. Other residues on ripretinib bind to the activation loop, stabilizing it out of the switch pocket and covering the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site, so kinase activation cannot occur.
This dual mechanism of action secures KIT and PDGFRα kinases in their inactive conformations providing broad in vitro inhibition of KIT and PDGFRα kinase activity, including wild type and multiple primary and secondary mutations. Ripretinib also inhibits other kinases in vitro, such as PDGFRβ, TIE2, VEGFR2, and BRAF.
Market Opportunity in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)
GISTs are the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and present most often in the stomach or small intestine. The typical patient is over 50 years old. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2019 approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients were newly diagnosed with GIST in the U.S. Estimates for 5-year survival range from 48% to 90% depending upon the stage of the disease at diagnosis.
GIST is a disease driven initially by primary mutations in KIT kinase in approximately 75% to 80% of cases or in PDGFRα kinase in approximately 5% to 10% of cases. In approximately 13% of all GIST patients, the disease is not driven by KIT or PDGFRα but by other genetic mutations or alterations. Primary mutations in the KIT gene are found in exon 11 in approximately 67% of GIST patients, in exon 9 in approximately 10% of GIST patients, and less frequently in exon 13 or 17. Primary mutations in the PDGFRα gene are found in exon 18 (a mutation referred to as D842V being the most frequent) in approximately 6% of GIST patients and more rarely in exon 12. Activation of these kinases caused by primary mutations leads to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and spread. The diagram below illustrates the mutations that drive GIST.
Metastatic KIT-driven GIST is a disease characterized by many mutations in KIT, with over 90% of individual KIT-driven GIST patients harboring multiple mutations that drive progression of their disease. Multiple secondary mutations can arise within an individual patient and/or tumor in different areas or sites of tumor growth. Drug resistant secondary mutations in patients with KIT-driven GIST span exon regions 13 to 18, and in a recent study, 35% of GIST patients had at least two secondary mutations, each as illustrated below.
The complex heterogeneity of KIT mutations within individual tumors and individual patients is a major cause of resistance to existing therapies, which individually only address a subset of the mutations driving disease progression. A kinase inhibitor that could inhibit a broad spectrum of clinically relevant KIT mutations could be of high therapeutic value in the treatment of KIT-driven GIST in patients who are unresponsive to treatment or have grown resistant to treatment. In PDGFRα-driven GIST, there are no approved therapies other than avapritinib. The primary PDGFRα mutations are mostly insensitive to imatinib and other drugs approved for GIST. We believe our design of ripretinib as a PDGFRα switch control inhibitor may make the appearance of secondary mutations less likely after treatment than with a traditional kinase inhibitor.
First-line Treatments For GIST
Patients diagnosed early with localized GIST generally undergo surgical resection of their tumors. In surgically resected patients considered at a high risk of recurrence and in unresectable or metastatic patients, the kinase inhibitor imatinib is the only approved first-line therapy in the U.S., other than avapritinib, which is approved in the U.S. for GIST patients with PDGFRα exon 18 mutations only (estimated to be approximately 6% of all patients with newly-diagnosed GIST). Imatinib is typically prescribed in doses of 400 mg or 800 mg daily. Tumors are usually measured by CT scan and changes in size characterized by RECIST. RECIST criteria define a partial response (PR) as tumor size reduction of 30% or more, a complete response (CR) as tumor size reduced by 100%, and disease progression as an increase in tumor size by 20% or more. RECIST criteria define stable disease as that in between a PR or disease progression. In one Phase 3 trial of GIST patients with unresectable or metastatic disease treated with imatinib, CRs were seen in only about 5% of patients dosed at 400 mg once daily (QD) and aggregate CRs and PRs, which is defined as best tumor response rate, were seen in approximately 45% of these patients. Patients with PDGFRα-driven GIST are mostly insensitive to imatinib and generally fail to respond to therapy. While imatinib generally is well-tolerated, in one clinical study involving patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib daily, 43% experienced one or more grade 3 to 5 adverse events, 16% underwent dose reductions, and 38% interrupted treatment. Among patients treated with 800 mg of imatinib daily, 58% had dose reductions, and 59% interrupted treatment.
Disease progression in advanced GIST is often due to secondary mutations in KIT or PDGFRα that cause resistance to first-line treatment. Although imatinib is effective against KIT mutations in exon 11 and has some limited efficacy against exon 9 mutations when the dose is increased from 400 mg to 800 mg daily, secondary mutations in KIT in exons 13, 14, 17, and 18 or most primary mutations in PDGFRα confer resistance to imatinib. While more than 80% of GIST patients will see some clinical benefit from imatinib monotherapy, and a small portion of patients have shown progression-free survival (PFS) up to ten years, greater than 50% of patients will develop disease progression by two years, and 90% at ten years. Of the approximately 4,000 to 6,000 GIST patients that are reported as newly diagnosed each year in the U.S., we estimate that about 65% will experience metastatic disease and 90% will receive first-line treatment with imatinib.
Second- and Third-line Treatments For GIST
In KIT-driven GIST patients who progress on imatinib, the clinical goal is stabilization of their disease. Objective responses, as judged by a RECIST-defined decrease in the size of measurable lesions, are rare and increasingly considered on their own to be poor surrogates for clinical benefit in second- and third-line patients. The FDA recognized endpoint for approval of the two approved agents for second- and third-line therapies in GIST was time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) and PFS, respectively. We believe that the rate of disease control, which includes patients with stable disease and PRs and CRs, is an appropriate measure of clinically relevant activity and a likely predictor of PFS and durability of treatment. In GIST patients who progress on imatinib, second-line therapy is typically sunitinib, which was approved in 2006 for patients with GIST who had disease progression following treatment with, or intolerance to, imatinib. Sunitinib has greater activity against mutations in KIT exon 9 compared to imatinib and less activity against mutations in KIT exon 11. Additionally, sunitinib shows activity against KIT exon 13 and 14 mutations, but is not active against mutations in exon 17 and 18. Only about half of GIST patients show benefit on sunitinib therapy and the reported TTP is 6.1 months. Unlike treatment with imatinib in first-line therapy, sunitinib rarely produces CRs or PRs per RECIST (on a confirmed and centrally read basis), or objective response rate (ORR), of approximately 7%. Approximately 5% to 10% of GIST patients on sunitinib experienced each of the following grade 3 or 4 adverse events: hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, and hand-foot syndrome. In two large retrospective studies of sunitinib in GIST, 20% of patients experienced adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. The emergence of KIT mutations in exon 17 or 18 confers resistance to sunitinib.
In 2013, regorafenib received marketing approval in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with metastatic and unresectable GIST who have experienced disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib and sunitinib. In addition to being active against KIT mutations in exon 11, regorafenib is the only approved therapy with activity against a subset of KIT mutations in exon 17. However, regorafenib does not inhibit all KIT mutations in exon 17 or 18. The reported median PFS with regorafenib is 4.8 months. Similar to treatment with sunitinib, regorafenib rarely produces CRs or PRs per RECIST as shown by the ORR of approximately 4.5%. Approximately 61% of GIST patients on regorafenib experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event including, hypertension (23%), hand-foot syndrome (20%), and diarrhea (5%). Regorafenib also has shown increased liver 
toxicity. Liver function tests are recommended prior to initiation of therapy and periodically over the first two months of treatment.
The following table shows reported PFS or TTP (as applicable), ORR, overall survival, all as per RECIST, for imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib in first-line, second-line, and third-line GIST, respectively, based upon the published results of registrational trials that were presented to the FDA for approval of these drugs.
While imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib inhibit certain clinically relevant initiating and drug resistance-causing mutations in KIT, these approved drugs, in addition to avapritinib, each inhibit only a limited subset of KIT and PDGFRα mutations known to occur in GIST patients. Although GIST patients may experience periods of disease control with these treatments, due to the heterogeneous nature of the mutations that drive the disease, many patients continue to progress and ultimately fail all lines of treatment. Of the approximately 4,000 to 6,000 GIST patients newly diagnosed each year in the U.S., we estimate that about 65% will experience metastatic disease. We estimate that annual new treatment-eligible second-line GIST patients in the U.S. are approximately 2,000, with an estimated annual prevalence of treated GIST patients in the second-line of approximately 2,600. We estimate that approximately 70 to 80% of eligible patients from the second-line will be eligible for third-line treatment, and approximately 70 to 80% of eligible patients from the third-line will be eligible for fourth-line treatment. Eligible patients for third- and fourth-line treatment exclude the estimated proportion of patients that die, discontinue treatment, or enter a clinical trial and, therefore, are not eligible for treatment; for later lines of therapy, we expect a similar drop-off rate. These estimates, which are based on our recent analyses of U.S. claims data, are inherently uncertain. We estimate the annual incidence of new patients with GIST to be approximately 8,000 in Europe and Japan. Treatment of GIST patients who are resistant to or intolerant of these approved second- and third-line drugs remains an area of high unmet medical need. In addition, avapritinib is the only currently approved therapeutic option for PDGFRα-driven GIST that potently inhibit D842V mutations, which is the most common PDGFRα mutation. We estimate that the annual incidence of new patients with PDGFRα-driven GIST in the U.S. and in Europe and Japan combined is approximately 400 and 700, respectively. In preclinical assays, ripretinib is potently active against the D842V mutation and other PDGFRα primary mutations. We believe that ripretinib may offer a potential new treatment for these patients in addition to those patients who failed currently approved kinase inhibitors.

INVICTUS: Completed Phase 3 Study in Fourth-Line and Fourth-Line Plus GIST
In December 2019, we submitted a NDA to the FDA for our lead drug candidate, ripretinib, for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, which is being reviewed under the RTOR pilot program. Our NDA submission is based on positive results from our first Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST patients, for whom there are currently no approved therapies other than avapritinib in the U.S., which is approved for GIST patients with PDGFRα exon 18 mutations only (estimated to be approximately 6% of all patients with newly-diagnosed GIST). In August 2019, we announced top-line results from INVICTUS, including that the study achieved its primary endpoint of improved PFS compared to placebo in patients with fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, as determined by blinded independent central radiologic review using modified RECIST. We announced additional data from INVICTUS as part of a late-breaking presentation of results in an oral session at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO 2019) meeting in September 2019. In February 2020, the FDA accepted our NDA for ripretinib for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST, granted priority review and set an action date of August 13, 2020 under the PDUFA. In October 2019, the FDA granted BTD for ripretinib for the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. In December 2019, we filed a NDS with Health Canada and an AUS MAA with the TGA in Australia for ripretinib in advanced GIST under Project Orbis. Both the NDS and the AUS MAA have received priority review. We are actively engaged in commercial preparations to support the potential U.S. launch of ripretinib, if approved, for 
the treatment of patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. We expect to file an EU MAA in the EU for ripretinib in advanced GIST in the second half of 2020, and are exploring whether to partner for, or build our own, European go-to-market capabilities, if approved.
The INVICTUS Phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ripretinib compared to placebo in patients with advanced GIST whose previous therapies have included at least imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. We enrolled 129 patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of GIST and had previously received at least three different kinase inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Patients were treated with ripretinib or placebo, in accordance with their randomization, until they developed disease progression, experienced unacceptable toxicity, or withdrew consent. Placebo patients had the opportunity to cross over to ripretinib treatment upon disease progression with placebo. Patients on ripretinib had the opportunity to remain on their current dose or escalate to 150 mg twice daily (BID) upon disease progression.
Patients were randomized 2:1 to either 150 mg of ripretinib or placebo once daily (QD) in repeated 28-day cycles with best supportive care. Patients were evaluated for PFS based upon independent radiologic review of CT scans, as assessed by modified RECIST. Tumor response assessments per modified RECIST were conducted every cycle for the first three cycles and then every two cycles thereafter beginning with the fourth cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST included ORR, overall survival (OS), and TTP.
In 2019, we announced top-line results from INVICTUS, including that the study achieved its primary endpoint of improved PFS compared to placebo.
In the INVICTUS study, ripretinib demonstrated a median PFS of 6.3 months (27.6 weeks) compared to 1.0 month (4.1 weeks) in the placebo arm and significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 85% (Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.15, 95% Confidence Interval (0.09,0.25), p-value <0.0001) compared to placebo. This PFS benefit was consistent across all assessed patient subgroups. The following graph shows the estimated PFS probability at each time point for the ripretinib and placebo arms in INVICTUS:
INVICTUS: Estimated PFS Probability for Ripretinib and Placebo Arms
*Double-blind period
For the key secondary endpoint of ORR as determined by blinded independent radiologic review using modified RECIST, ripretinib demonstrated an ORR of 9.4% compared with 0% for placebo (p-value=0.0504), which was not statistically significant. As of the cutoff date of May 31, 2019, the median duration of response had not been reached with seven of the eight patients still responding to treatment. All responders had partial responses.
Ripretinib also showed a clinically meaningful improvement over placebo in terms of the secondary endpoint of OS (median OS 15.1 months with ripretinib compared to 6.6 months with placebo, HR = 0.36, 95% Confidence Interval (0.20,0.62), nominal p-value=0.0004). According to the pre-specified hierarchical testing procedure of the endpoints, the hypothesis testing of OS cannot be formally conducted unless the test of ORR is statistically significant. Since statistical 
significance was not achieved for ORR, the hypothesis testing of OS was not formally performed. The OS data for the placebo arm includes patients taking placebo who, following progression, were crossed-over to ripretinib treatment. The following graph shows the estimated OS probability at each time point for the ripretinib and placebo arms in INVICTUS:
INVICTUS: Estimated OS Probability for Ripretinib and Placebo Arms
*Due to hierarchal testing procedures of the endpoints, the OS endpoint could not be formally tested because the ORR was not statistically significant. 
†Data includes all time periods, including dose escalations. Placebo arm includes patients taking placebo who, following progression, were crossed-over to ripretinib treatment.
Ripretinib was generally well tolerated and the adverse events reported in the INVICTUS study were consistent with data from previously presented Phase 1 study results. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 42 patients (49%) on the ripretinib arm compared to 19 patients (44%) on the placebo arm. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in greater than 5% of patients in the ripretinib arm were anemia (9%; n=8), abdominal pain (7%; n=6), and hypertension (7%; n=6). Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in greater than 5% of patients in the placebo arm were anemia (14%; n=6).
The below table lists all TEAEs (and corresponding grade 3 and 4 TEAEs) in greater than 10% of patients in the ripretinib arm compared to the placebo arm in INVICTUS.

INTRIGUE: Ongoing Phase 3 Study in Second-Line GIST
In December 2018, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ripretinib compared to sunitinib in second-line GIST patients. We believe that the results from INTRIGUE, if positive, would support a NDA for approval in second-line GIST patients in the U.S., and similar applications in Europe and other major markets.
The INTRIGUE Phase 3 study is an interventional, randomized, global, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ripretinib compared to sunitinib in approximately 358 patients with GIST previously treated with imatinib. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either 150 mg of ripretinib once daily or 50 mg of sunitinib once daily for four 
weeks followed by two weeks without sunitinib. The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST include ORR and OS. As of February 14, 2020, we had 111 sites open for enrollment of INTRIGUE. We expect to fully complete enrollment of INTRIGUE in the second half of 2020. As an event-driven study, the analysis of the primary endpoint for INTRIGUE will occur once a pre-specified number of events, defined as death or disease progression events based on independent radiologic review using modified RECIST, has occurred. We are planning to increase the total number of patients in the study to strengthen the ability to achieve the pre-specified number of events due to a recent trend of a higher than expected number of censored patients. Patient discontinuations that result in a patient being censored instead of counting toward the required number of total events can include discontinuations after local progression that has not been confirmed centrally, withdrawal of consent, and a randomized patient that does not ever receive treatment. An increase in the total number of patients would require a protocol amendment and the currently anticipated increase is not expected to change the total number of required events, the statistical powering of the study, or our current guidance of achieving full enrollment in the second half of 2020.
Ongoing Phase 1 Expansion Trial of Ripretinib in GIST and Other Solid Tumors
We have an ongoing Phase 1 trial studying ripretinib in patients with different stages of GIST following treatment with at least one systemic anticancer therapy, such as imatinib, as well as in patients with SM and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, NSCLC, germ cell cancer, penile cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas, as well as a cohort for GIST and other solid tumors with renal impairment. We completed the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1 trial, focused on evaluating the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ripretinib, and determined a Phase 2 dose. The primary objectives of the expansion stage of the Phase 1 trial are to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ripretinib and to determine the antitumor activity of ripretinib in all diseases studied in the trial. The secondary objectives are to determine the PK profile of ripretinib and determine allele frequency of KIT and PDGFRα mutations in ctDNA and compare it with mutation allele frequency in GIST tumor tissue at baseline and in response to treatment with ripretinib. The safety endpoints of the expansion phase of the Phase 1 trial include dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug due to toxicity and adverse events. The endpoints for preliminary assessment of antitumor activity include ORR and disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks. Other endpoints include PFS for all solid tumor patients.
The expansion stage may enroll up to 270 patients in 10 cohorts including three GIST cohorts, one for each of second-, third-, fourth-, and fourth-line plus GIST, one for GIST or other solid tumor patients with renal impairment, one cohort for SM with other hematologic malignancies, and five cohorts for other KIT and PDGFRα-driven solid tumors, including an other solid tumor cohort and one for each of malignant gliomas, melanoma, NSCLC, germ cell cancer, penile cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas.
The starting dose for ripretinib in the expansion cohorts is the expansion dose of 150 mg QD that was determined during the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1 trial, except for the SM cohort, which is currently using 150 mg BID as the starting dose. Patients who have disease progression by specified indication response criteria in the expansion stage may escalate to the higher daily dose (150 mg BID) of ripretinib after completion of the second cycle. We expect to report data from one or more of these expansion cohorts in the second half of 2020.
AACR-NCI-EORTC Meeting 2019 Data Presentation on Phase 1 Study in GIST Patients at Starting Dose of 150 mg Daily and Additional Related Data
We presented updated preliminary results from our ongoing Phase 1 study of ripretinib in patients with second-line through fourth-line plus GIST at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (the Triple Meeting 2019) in October 2019, and in related releases. These results included data from 142 GIST patients in the escalation and expansion phases of the study receiving 150 mg QD of ripretinib as the starting dose, which is the dose being administered in our INVICTUS and INTRIGUE registration-enabling studies, as of an August 10, 2019 data cutoff date. The table below includes local, investigator-assessed ORR by best response as determined by modified RECIST, median duration of response, median progression free survival (mPFS), and mean treatment duration.

Development of Ripretinib in Systemic Mastocytosis & Other Solid Tumors
Mastocytosis is a disease characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells, a type of white blood cell, located in peripheral tissues and organs. Mast cells store components that mediate inflammatory and allergic responses, such as tryptase, histamine, serotonin, and heparin. The disease can be sub-divided into cutaneous mastocytosis where mast cells accumulate only in the skin and systemic mastocytosis where mast cells accumulate in at least one organ (with or without skin involvement). In adults, most cases are systemic, frequently with accompanying skin involvement, whereas in children cutaneous mastocytosis is more common and many of the cases resolve spontaneously. While the exact number of patients suffering from all forms of mastocytosis, including urticaria pigmentosa, is not known, it is estimated that about 3,000 patients are newly diagnosed each year in the U.S. and about 30,000 patients live with the disease in the U.S. Within systemic mastocytosis there are four main sub-types: indolent and smoldering mastocytosis (ISM), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (aggressive SM), systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). Advanced systemic mastocytosis includes aggressive SM, SM-AHN, and MCL. We estimate the annual incidence of new patients with systemic mastocytosis to be approximately 1,400 and 2,800 in the U.S., Europe and Japan combined, respectively. Rates of survival vary significantly between the various sub-types, from normal in patients with ISM to significantly less than one year in patients with MCL. The chart below summarizes the prognosis, or likely course of the disease, and survival, or the time from which primary treatment begins, until death.
Subtypes of Systemic Mastocytosis
Approximately 94% of systemic mastocytosis patients are reported to have a somatic D816V mutation in KIT. This D816V mutation is a gain-of-function mutation in the KIT activation switch, which leads to unregulated KIT activation. The KIT receptor, which is widely expressed on mast cells, stimulates signaling pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The gain-of-function mutation, D816V, enables mast cells to proliferate in the absence of normal activation signals. Approved drugs to manage the symptoms include antihistamines, corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor antagonists, epinephrine salbutamol, and other beta-2 agonists. Midostaurin, which targets various kinases including FLT3, PDGFRα, CDK1, Src, KIT, and VEGFR, was approved for the treatment of aggressive SM, SM-AHN, and MCL in April 2017 in the U.S. based on response rate and duration in a single-arm, open-label study of midostaurin 100 mg orally twice daily. Ripretinib potently inhibits the D816V mutation. We are enrolling SM patients within an expansion cohort of our Phase 1 trial.
Preclinical Profile of Ripretinib
We specifically designed ripretinib, our KIT and PDGFRα switch control inhibitor, to improve the treatment of GIST patients by inhibiting the full spectrum of the known mutant KIT and PDGFRα kinases responsible for initiating the disease, or primary mutations, and the KIT mutations that cause drug resistance or secondary mutations.
In April 2018, at AACR 2018, and in a 2019 publication in the journal Cancer Cell, we presented updated preclinical data that describes the breadth of inhibition achieved with ripretinib and its active metabolite, DP-5439, across both primary and secondary KIT mutations and primary PDGFRα mutations compared to the in vitro profiles of the FDA-approved kinase inhibitors, imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, midostaurin, and the then investigational drug, avapritinib (BLU-285). Potency is measured by the concentration of ripretinib or DP-5439 required to inhibit kinase activity by 50%, or the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50). The lower the bar in the following graphs, the greater the potency. Compared to the compounds 
tested, ripretinib and its active metabolite, DP-5439, exhibited the broadest profile of inhibition across primary and secondary drug-resistant KIT mutations, and primary mutations in PDGFRα.
In enzyme assays at relevant cellular levels of ATP, ripretinib broadly inhibited primary and drug-resistant KIT mutations and primary PDGFRα mutations. Ripretinib also broadly inhibited KIT and PDGFRα mutations in a panel of GIST, mastocytosis, leukemia, lung cancer, and transfected cell assays.
The data presented above demonstrate the ability of ripretinib to inhibit known KIT and PDGFRα initiating mutations and KIT drug resistance mutations. These results against the broad range of KIT mutations known to occur in GIST patients provides preclinical data that support a broad spectrum KIT profile observed with ripretinib in reducing ctDNA MAF in all clinically relevant exons.
We also evaluated the potential resilience of ripretinib to new gain-of-function KIT resistance mutations to kinase switch control inhibition. To that end, we performed saturation mutagenesis studies in cells to examine the emergence of new mutations in KIT following exposure to ripretinib or imatinib. The results demonstrate that, while new KIT drug resistance mutations are produced rapidly in response to imatinib exposure (four new mutations secondary to exposure were recorded), we observed no gain-of-function KIT mutations resistant to ripretinib. These results further support the broad spectrum KIT inhibitor profile of ripretinib and its potential resilience to the emergence of mutations resistant to kinase switch control inhibition.
DCC-3014: A Potent and Highly Selective Inhibitor of CSF1R
DCC-3014 is an investigational, orally administered, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of CSF1R, also known as FMS. CSF1R is a kinase that controls the survival and function of TAMs. DCC-3014 was designed to selectively bind to the CSF1R switch pocket. It has greater than 100-fold selectivity for CSF1R over the closely related kinases FLT3, KIT, PDGFRα, PDGFRß, and VEGFR2 and has an even greater selectivity for CSF1R over approximately 300 other human kinases that we tested.
We are currently studying DCC-3014 in a Phase 1 dose escalation study that includes patients with advanced malignancies as well as patients with TGCT. The Phase 1 dose escalation study is designed to determine a Phase 2 dose for the expansion portion of the study. During 2019, we announced positive, preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study with DCC-3014 in patients with advanced malignancies and preliminary data from three initial patients diagnosed with diffuse-type TGCT. To explore the potential of DCC-3014 in this target population, we intend to continue to enroll TGCT patients in the dose escalation study, and, in the second half of 2020, provide a data update on TGCT patients. Subject to favorable results from the dose escalation study, in the second half of 2020, we intend to determine a Phase 2 dose for, and initiate, the expansion portion of the study with DCC-3014 in patients with TGCT. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to study DCC-3014 in advanced malignancies in combination with other therapies, including I/O therapies.
Market Opportunity in Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT)
TGCTs are a group of benign tumors that involve the synovium, bursae, and/or tendon sheath. Although benign, these tumors can grow and cause damage to surrounding tissues and structures inducing pain, swelling, and limitation of movement of the joint. Surgery is the main treatment option; however, these tumors tend to recur. If untreated or if the tumor continually recurs, damage and degeneration may occur in the affected joint and surrounding tissues, which may cause significant disability. A genetic mutation in certain cells within the tumor causes overproduction of CSF-1, the ligand for the CSF1R receptor, which attracts macrophages and certain other cells that become the bulk of these tumors and cause the associated inflammatory changes.
TGCTs are divided into types based on where they are and how quickly they grow. Localized TGCT grows slowly and starts in smaller joints like the fingers, toes, knee, wrist, and ankle. In 2017, annual incidence of new localized TGCT cases in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately 13,000. Diffuse-type TGCT grows quickly and most commonly affects the knee, as well as the hip, ankle, elbow, and shoulder. In 2017, annual incidence of new diffuse-type TGCT cases in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately 1,300. The current standard of care for TGCT is surgical resection, with high recurrence rates for diffuse-type TGCT following complete resection.
CSF1R inhibition has demonstrated clinical benefit in diffuse-type TGCT patients and we believe that despite an approved treatment for diffuse-type TGCT patients in the U.S., there remains an unmet medical need for this population. In a randomized Phase 3 trial, pexidartinib, a CSF1R inhibitor approved by the FDA in August 2019 for the treatment of symptomatic TGCT, demonstrated the proportion of patients who achieved ORR was higher for pexidartinib, at 38%, versus placebo, at 0%, at week 25 by RECIST, version 1.1. The FDA approval includes a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for pexidartinib, including intensive monitoring, due to off-target hepatotoxicity concerns.
Ongoing Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study and Proposed Expansion Study of DCC-3014 in Patients with TGCT
The Phase 1 dose escalation study is a single arm study of DCC-3014 that is designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of DCC-3014 in approximately 60 patients with advanced malignancies, including 
TGCT. The ongoing dose escalation study will determine the Phase 2 dose and the MTD using a 3+3 dose escalation design with a minimum of three patients enrolled at each dose level cohort; starting at a dose of 10 mg once daily. Loading doses administered in the second level cohort and subsequent cohorts were based on PK profiles observed in the first cohort. Subject to favorable results from the dose escalation study, we intend in the second half of 2020 to select a Phase 2 dose and initiate the expansion portion of the study. The expansion portion of the study will be designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, PK, and PD of DCC-3014 in TGCT.
In October 2019, at the Triple Meeting 2019, we announced positive, preliminary, updated top-line data from the ongoing dose escalation Phase 1 study with DCC-3014 in patients with advanced malignancies. We also announced preliminary initial data from three diffuse-type TGCT patients enrolled in the dose escalation study in November 2019 at CTOS 2019. Preliminary results from the ongoing dose escalation Phase 1 study, including the three initial patients with diffuse-type TGCT, are summarized below.
Safety, PK, and PD data were analyzed as of September 10, 2019, with additional anti-tumor activity data reported as of November 8, 2019. Tumor reductions from baseline were determined by investigator assessment by RECIST. As of the data cut-off date of September 10, 2019, increasing doses of DCC-3014 were assessed in seven dose cohorts across 39 patients with advanced solid tumors, including three patients with diffuse-type TGCT. This included one dose cohort that received 10 mg QD and six dose cohorts that received a three to five day loading dose regimen at doses of up to 50 mg followed by a schedule of daily, once-weekly, or twice-weekly maintenance dosing with DCC-3014.
DCC-3014 was generally well-tolerated, and among TEAEs occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of patients, regardless of relatedness, most events were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 or 4 related TEAEs occurred in four patients, which were grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase, grade 4 lipase increased, grade 3 amylase increased, and grade 3 colitis; no grade 3 or 4 TEAEs occurred in the diffuse-type TGCT patients. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 17 malignant solid tumor patients, none of which were related to DCC-3014 and there were no SAEs reported in diffuse-type TGCT patients. The most common TEAEs in greater than 10% of patients are shown in the table below.

Data from the Phase 1 trial also demonstrated approximately dose-proportional exposure for DCC-3014 and exposure was generally consistent between diffuse-type TGCT and solid tumor patients. As depicted in the graphs below, DCC-3014 treatment in this study demonstrated on-target PD inhibition of CSF1R by causing a dose-related rise in plasma CSF1 and IL-34 and a reduction of CD16+ monocytes in peripheral blood as well as decreases in CD163+ macrophages in tumor.

All three patients with diffuse-type TGCT treated as of the data analyses dates showed preliminary anti-tumor activity, as depicted in the graph below. As of their first tumor assessment at Cycle 3 Day 1, tumor reductions from baseline of 48%, 25%, and 24%, respectively, were observed. One patient had a confirmed PR, which had been sustained for nine months and was ongoing as of the most recent investigator report (as of the November 2019 analyses date), with a tumor reduction from baseline of 84% as of Cycle 10 Day 1. Symptomatic improvements in mobility and reduced pain, as reported by the investigator, were observed. These patients were enrolled in cohort 5 with a 30 mg loading dose daily for five days followed by a maintenance dose of 30 mg twice a week. Two patients remained on study as of the November 2019 data analyses date. One patient discontinued in Cycle 4 due to relocation outside of the U.S.

This data set is in a very small number of patients, including without limitation, only three diffuse-type TGCT patients, and may not be predictive of, or consistent with, the complete, additional, or final results of this study or later studies.
Selectivity and Preclinical Profile of DCC-3014
We evaluated the selectivity of DCC-3014 for CSF1R in a standard biochemical assay, called a kinome screen assay. The kinome screen assay assesses the concentrations of DCC-3014 at which it inhibits CSF1R and other kinases. We conducted this assay in the presence of ATP. ATP is essential for kinase activation, and the presence of higher concentrations of ATP increases the activity of kinases. The potency of traditional kinase inhibitors is often highly sensitive to increased ATP.
The following figure on the left depicts the results of the kinome screen assay using a 10 micromolar concentration of ATP, a standard low concentration typically used in this assay. Each kinase in the assay is depicted as a point at the end of a branch in the figure, and each kinase inhibited by DCC-3014 is depicted as a red dot and listed in the key to the figure. IC50 values are depicted by the size of the dots, where larger dots reflect greater potency for a given kinase while smaller dots reflect lesser potency. For each kinase that DCC-3014 inhibited in the kinome screen assay, we then assessed the inhibiting activity in a separate biochemical assay using a 4 millimolar concentration of ATP, equivalent to that present in human cells. The following figure on the right depicts the results of this second assay. As shown below, DCC-3014 inhibits CSF1R at concentrations much lower than the concentrations at which it inhibits other kinases, and this selective inhibition of CSF1R was more pronounced at the higher concentrations of ATP typically found in human cells. The increase in selectivity is a feature of kinase switch control inhibition, which is not affected by high ATP concentration for targeted kinases.
DCC-3014 Exhibits High Selectivity for CSF1R at Low, Screening
Concentrations of ATP (10 µM) and Even Higher Selectively at Cellular Levels of ATP (4 mM)
CSF1R is a receptor for the ligands Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (MCSF) and interleukin 34 (IL34). CSF1R controls the differentiation and function of macrophages, a type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, microbes, and cancer cells. These macrophages are also programmed to either activate the immune system to fight a cancer (so-called M1 macrophages) or programmed to inactivate the immune system and promote tumor growth (so-called M2 macrophages). Pro-tumoral M2 macrophages have been shown to infiltrate certain tumors including cancers of the breast, cervix, pancreas, bladder, and brain where poor prognosis correlates with the density of these TAMs. Tumors induce TAMs to suppress a natural immune response mediated by cytotoxic T-cells, a type of lymphocyte that would otherwise eradicate the tumor; a process known as macrophage checkpoints. In animal models of several cancers, DCC-3014 has demonstrated potent macrophage checkpoint inhibition by blocking TAM-mediated immunosuppression as both a single agent and in combination with PD1 checkpoint inhibitors. TAMs are immunosuppressive and the greater the number in the tumor 
microenvironment, the lower the immune system's ability to attack the cancer. TAMs mediate their immunosuppressive function by decreasing the levels of the tumor-fighting CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. In the first figure below, control treatment with vehicle (placebo) results in a high TAM to CD8 T-cell ratio (black bar), indicative of high numbers of infiltrating TAMs that suppress the number of tumor fighting CD8 T-cells. This ratio is dramatically reversed (gray bar) after treatment with DCC-3014 to a tumor fighting state. In the second figure below, the ratio of the number of tumor fighting CD8 T-cells to the number of Treg cells is illustrated. Whereas CD8 T-cells are tumor fighting immune cells, Treg cells are immunosuppressive T-cells that, like TAMs, suppress the ability of the immune system to attack the cancer. Treatment with vehicle (placebo) results in a low ratio of CD8 T-cells to Treg cells, resulting in an immunosuppressed immune cell infiltration to the tumor site (black bar). Treatment with DCC-3014 reverses this ratio to an enhanced tumor fighting state illustrated by the higher ratio of tumor fighting CD8 T-cells to immunosuppressive Treg cells (gray bar).
Rebastinib: A Potent and Selective TIE2 Inhibitor
Rebastinib is an investigational, orally administered, potent, and selective inhibitor of the TIE2 immunokinase, the receptor for angiopoietins, an important family of vascular growth factors. Rebastinib binds potently into the switch pocket of TIE2, stabilizing the inhibitory switch and displacing the activation switch to block TIE2 signaling. TIE2 has an important role in regulating tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and immunotolerance in a manner analogous to CSF1R. Whereas CSF1R is expressed on TAMs in certain cancers, there is a different and distinct population of pro-tumoral M2 macrophages in which TIE2 is active, known as TIE2 expressing macrophages (TEMs).
Ongoing Phase 1b/2 Studies of Rebastinib in Combination with Chemotherapy
Rebastinib is currently in clinical development for the treatment of multiple solid tumors in combination with chemotherapy in two Phase 1b/2 studies, one with paclitaxel and one with carboplatin.
In October 2018, we announced that we initiated an open-label, multicenter, two-part Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 of this study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of 50 mg and 100 mg rebastinib BID when administered in combination with paclitaxel, and to determine the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. In Part 2 of this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel is being assessed across multiple cohorts, including: breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. This study enrolled 43 evaluable patients in Part 1 and will enroll up to 132 evaluable patients in Part 2. At the Triple Meeting 2019, we presented preliminary data from 43 patients from Part 1 of the study, including 24 patients from the rebastinib 50 mg oral BID with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV cohort and 19 patients from the rebastinib 100 mg oral BID with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV cohort.
Rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel was generally well-tolerated, with similar frequency of TEAEs between the two dose cohorts, and most TEAEs were consistent with the first-in-human study of rebastinib or known to be associated with treatment with paclitaxel. One patient experienced a rebastinib-related SAE (grade 2 muscular weakness), and four patients had an SAE related to paclitaxel and rebastinib (five events including grade 3 pneumonia (n=2), grade 3 nausea (n=1), grade 3 vomiting (n=1), and grade 2 myocardial ischemia (n=1)). Based on the observed frequency of muscular weakness in preliminary data from the ongoing Part 2 portion of the study with the 100 mg BID dose, the Phase 2 dose was changed from 100 mg BID to 50 mg BID.
Preliminary results from Part 1 included encouraging early signals of anti-tumor activity observed in both dose cohorts, with objective responses seen across a heavily pre-treated patient population, including patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel. Objective responses were seen in eight patients including ovarian (3), breast (2), carcinosarcoma (2), and peritoneal 
mesothelioma (1), seven of whom had prior therapy with paclitaxel or docetaxel. A best response of PR was observed in 5 of 24 patients in the 50 mg BID dose cohort and 3 of 19 patients in the 100 mg BID dose. The charts below illustrate the time on treatment and best response in both dose cohorts for Part 1 of the study.

Exposure to rebastinib in this study was dose-proportional at the 50 mg BID and 100 mg BID doses when administered in combination with paclitaxel. Mean circulating angiopoietin-2 levels increased with exposure to higher doses of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, indicative of PD on-target inhibition of TIE2 in these patients.
Part 2 of the study is ongoing and we expect to report Phase 1b/2 data with rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel in the second half of 2020.
In January 2019, we announced that we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 (3+3 dose escalation) of this two-part study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of 50 mg and 100 mg rebastinib BID when administered in combination with carboplatin, and to determine the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. In Part 2, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin administered once every three weeks will be assessed across multiple disease cohorts, including: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and mesothelioma. This study is expected to enroll up to 117 patients in total, with approximately 18 patients in Part 1 and up to 99 patients in Part 2. We have completed Part 1, selected a Phase 2 dose of 100 mg BID of rebastinib and activated Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin. We expect to report Phase 1b/2 data with rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in the second half of 2020.
Selectivity and Preclinical Profile of Rebastinib
We evaluated the selectively of rebastinib for TIE2 in a kinome screen assay. The kinome screen assay assesses the concentrations of rebastinib at which it inhibits TIE2 and other kinases. Rebastinib has greater than 100-fold selectively for TIE2. The following figure depicts the results of the kinome screen assay using a 10 micromolar concentration of ATP, a standard low concentration typically used in this assay, followed by further testing of kinase inhibition at a concentration of 4 mM ATP, approximating cellular levels of ATP. Each kinase in the assay is depicted as a point at the end of a branch in the figure, and each kinase inhibited by rebastinib is depicted as a red dot and listed in the legend to the figure.
We evaluated the activity of rebastinib in a polyoma middle-T antigen (PyMT) syngeneic mouse model in which murine breast cancer growth and metastasis can be assessed. In this model, tumor growth leads to metastasis, which is known to be modulated by TEMs. We examined multiple dosing schedules of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. In these preclinical studies, treatment with rebastinib significantly decreased tumor growth in the PyMT syngeneic mouse breast cancer model, reduced blood microvessel density, and inhibited the TEMs. Treatment with rebastinib also significantly reduced the number of circulating tumor cells and metastases.
The figure below depicts the results of our evaluation of rebastinib in the PyMT syngeneic mouse breast cancer model. We treated the mice with vehicle, paclitaxel, rebastinib, or a combination of rebastinib and paclitaxel. Tumor size was measured by weight at 31 days after initiation and every two or three days thereafter.
Treatment with rebastinib, either alone or in combination with paclitaxel, controlled tumor growth to a greater extent than vehicle or paclitaxel alone.
Preclinical Candidate: DCC-3116
In June 2019, we announced a new development candidate, DCC-3116, a small molecule ULK kinase inhibitor, designed to inhibit autophagy, a key tumor survival mechanism in cancer cells. DCC-3116, discovered using our novel switch control inhibitor platform, is designed to inhibit autophagy by inhibiting the ULK kinase, which has been shown to be the initiating factor that activates autophagy. Subject to favorable IND-enabling studies and FDA acceptance of our IND, currently expected to be filed in second half of 2020, we intend to develop DCC-3116 for the potential treatment of RAS mutant cancers in combination with inhibitors of downstream RAS effector targets including RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors as well as with direct inhibitors of mutant RAS.
Autophagy is a cellular pathway that has been observed to be upregulated in mutant RAS cancers and is also known to mediate resistance to inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway. Autophagy is a survival pathway in which cells respond to stress by recycling their own components and/or clearing damaged organelles and proteins from the cell. Mutant RAS cancers, including KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS cancers, are reported to have high basal levels of autophagy, which these cancers use to maintain nutrient supply, regulate cancer cell metabolism, and mitochondria surveillance. Cellular studies in mutant RAS cancers have demonstrated that MAPK pathway inhibitors can also induce autophagy as a compensatory survival mechanism. Such induction is seen with RAF, MEK, and ERK inhibitors as well as with direct inhibitors of mutant KRAS G12C. In in vitro models of mutant RAS cancers, inhibition of autophagy combined with inhibition of MAPK signaling using MEK inhibitors or ERK inhibitors has demonstrated synergistic anti-proliferative activity and induction of cell killing. In vivo studies conducted by independent research groups have also demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity in various mutant RAS cancer models.
In our preclinical studies, we have observed DCC-3116 to selectively inhibit the ULK kinase. Our in vitro studies have also demonstrated that DCC-3116 in combination with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway inhibits both basal autophagy (autophagy in the absence of a MAPK inhibitor) and also MAPK inhibitor-induced increased autophagy in various mutant RAS cancer cell lines as illustrated in the graphs below. Autophagy inhibition by DCC-3116 was monitored by the decrease in phosphorylation of the cellular ULK autophagy substrate ATG13 in the presence of the MEK inhibitor trametinib.
Preclinical Inhibition of ULK Kinase by DCC-3116 in Multiple RAS Cancer Cell Lines
When evaluated in preclinical in vivo models, DCC-3116 in combination with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway demonstrated synergistic inhibition of mutant RAS or mutant RAF cancer growth as shown below. In KRAS mutant pancreatic, lung, and BRAF mutant melanoma in vivo models, DCC-3116 in combination with trametinib reduced tumor size as compared to the control cohort or either single agent treatment cohort. In addition, DCC-3116 in combination with binimetinib and ulixertinib showed a decrease in pancreatic tumor growth as compared to the control cohort or either single agent treatment cohort.
DCC-3116, in Combination with MEK Inhibitor, Trametinib, Inhibited Pancreatic, Lung, and Melanoma Xenograft Tumor Growth
DCC-3116, in Combination with MEK Inhibitor Binimetinib or ERK inhibitor Ulixertinib, Decreased Pancreatic Xenograft Tumor Growth
As an inhibitor of ULK kinase, DCC-3116 has been designed to address mutant RAS cancers by inhibiting the basal and compensatory autophagy that mutant RAS cancer cells use for survival. We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies for DCC-3116 and, pending favorable results, we expect to submit an IND to the FDA in the second half of 2020.
Platform Development and Preclinical Pipeline
We intend to leverage our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform to advance additional drug candidates into clinical development. Our discovery programs are focused on novel immunokinases, kinases critical to autophagy and cancer cell metabolism, and kinases known to selectively drive cancer cell growth and survival. We are advancing the preclinical development of additional programs and expect to initiate further preclinical studies in one of these programs.
Out-License of Ripretinib in Greater China
In June 2019, we entered into the Zai License Agreement with an affiliate of Zai, pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ripretinib in Greater China and also referred to as the Territory. We retain exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, manufacture, and commercialize the Licensed Products outside the Territory.
Pursuant to the terms of the Zai License Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $20.0 million and became eligible to receive up to $185.0 million in potential development and commercial milestone payments, consisting of up to $50.0 million of development milestones and up to $135.0 million of commercial milestones. In addition, during the term of the Zai License Agreement, Zai will be obligated to pay us tiered percentage royalties ranging from low to high teens on potential annual net sales of the Licensed Products in the Territory, subject to adjustments in specified circumstances.
Under the Zai License Agreement, we recognized revenue of $25.0 million in 2019, which consisted of a $20.0 million upfront payment and a $5.0 million INTRIGUE study-related development milestone payment, which was achieved in July 2019.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Zai License Agreement, Zai will be responsible for conducting the development and commercialization activities in the Territory related to the Licensed Products.
Subject to specified exceptions, during the term of the Zai License Agreement, each party has agreed that neither it nor its affiliates nor, with respect to Zai, its sublicensees, will conduct any development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities in the Territory that may be deemed competitive with the Licensed Products. In addition, under the Zai License Agreement, each party has granted the other party specified intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Zai License Agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development, and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Zai License Agreement. We will supply or have supplied to Zai the Licensed Product pursuant to a supply agreement and for agreed upon consideration.
The Zai License Agreement will continue on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and region-by-region basis until the later of (i) the abandonment, expiry, or final determination of invalidity of the last valid claim within our patent rights that covers the Licensed Product in such region in the Territory; (ii) the expiry of the regulatory exclusivity for such Licensed Product in such region; or (iii) the close of business of the day that is exactly ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such region. Subject to the terms of the Zai License Agreement, Zai may terminate the Zai License Agreement for convenience by providing written notice to us, which termination will be effective following a prescribed notice period. In addition, we may terminate the Zai License Agreement under specified circumstances if Zai or certain other parties challenge our patent rights or if Zai or its affiliates do not conduct certain development activities with respect to one or more Licensed Products for a specified period of time, subject to specified exceptions. Either party may terminate the Zai License Agreement for the other party's uncured material breach of a material term of the Zai License Agreement, with a customary notice and cure period, or insolvency. After termination (but not natural expiration), we are entitled to retain a worldwide and perpetual license from Zai to exploit the Licensed Products. On a region-by-region and a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, upon the natural expiration of the Zai License Agreement as described above, the licenses granted by us to Zai under the Zai License Agreement in such region with respect to the Licensed Product become fully paid-up, perpetual, and irrevocable.
Commercial Operations
For ripretinib, we intend to establish and are currently building our own commercial and marketing organization in the U.S. and to either build ourselves or selectively establish partnerships, such as the Zai license for Greater China described above, in markets outside the U.S. We intend to build a specialist sales force to target physicians who are high prescribers of treatments for invasive solid tumors. We expect that the sales force will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support. Additionally, we expect that the sales and marketing teams will manage relationships with key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, physician group networks, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we expect to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to approval of ripretinib, which we may never obtain.
For our other drug candidates in oncology, we intend to retain commercialization rights in the U.S. and leverage our commercial and marketing organization for ripretinib, with appropriate additions or modifications as necessitated by the specific indications pursued, assuming we obtain regulatory approval in the U.S., and consider whether to build our own commercial and marketing organization in select markets outside the U.S., or selectively establish partnerships. Accordingly, we will consider entering into relationships with strategic partners that enable the expansion of the ongoing clinical development and/or licenses for development and commercialization or distribution, while retaining significant value for our shareholders. These pharmaceutical company partnerships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for future commercial supply of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product from third-party manufacturers for ripretinib, DCC-3014, rebastinib, and DCC-3116 to support preclinical and clinical testing. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any long-term supply arrangements in place except for commercial supply arrangements for ripretinib. Furthermore, we do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of drug substance and drug product. We do not currently have a validated manufacturing process in place for any product candidate which would be required to support commercialization of any of our drug candidates, if approved.
All of our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. As drug substances, they can be manufactured from readily available or custom synthesized starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that are amenable to scale-up. Some, including ripretinib, may require specialized processing to optimize performance of the drug product. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and other rare genetic diseases. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the field of kinase inhibition for cancer and other diseases. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
If we receive approval for the drug candidates in our priority programs for the indications we are targeting, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in clinical trials.
Competition for Ripretinib
We are initially developing ripretinib for patients with GIST, SM, and other solid tumors with mutations in KIT and PDGFRα.
In GIST, the current approved standards of care for unresectable or metastatic patients are first-line imatinib, followed by second-line sunitinib upon imatinib progression, followed by third-line regorafenib upon sunitinib progression. In addition, avapritinib was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for patients with GIST harboring a PDGFRα exon 18 mutation only. If ripretinib receives marketing approval for GIST, we may also face competition from pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies with drug candidates in clinical trials including AB Sciences S.A. (ABS), Allakos Inc. (Allakos), ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. (ARIAD), Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arog), Blueprint Medicines Corporation (BMC), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (Celldex), Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis), Ningbo Tai Kang Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (NTKMT), Novartis AG (Novartis), Plexxikon Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Plexxikon), Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, and Xencor, Inc. (Xencor).
For SM, the only approved drugs that inhibit KIT are imatinib for patients without the KIT D816V mutation or mutational status unknown and midostaurin (Novartis). If ripretinib receives marketing approval, in addition to midostaurin it may face competition from other drug candidates in clinical trials for SM, including drug candidates from ABS, Allakos, BMC, Celldex, and Plexxikon.
Competition for DCC-3014
We are initially developing DCC-3014, an inhibitor of CSF1R, to control immunosuppressive TAM to assist the immune system in targeting tumor cells. If DCC-3014 receives marketing approval, it may face competition from other drug candidates currently being marketed or in clinical trials that target CSF1R, including small molecule drug candidates currently being marketed or in clinical trials from Abbisko Therapeutics Co., Ltd. (Abbisko), Amgen, Inc. (Amgen), BMS, Daiichi Sankyo Company (DSC), Limited, Novartis, and from antibody therapeutics including those from Amgen, Eli Lilly and Company (Eli Lilly), Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. (Five Prime), Novartis, Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), Roche Holding Ltd (Roche), and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Syndax).
Competition for Rebastinib
We are initially developing rebastinib, a TIE2 inhibitor, to control immunosuppressive TAMs expressing TIE2 to assist the immune system in targeting tumor cells. While rebastinib is a novel molecule, we may face competition from drug candidates in clinical trials that are not TIE2 inhibitors, but aim to achieve similar effects on the immune system. These include small molecule drug candidates in clinical trials from BMS, Novartis, Pfizer, Plexxikon, and from antibody therapeutics from Amgen, Eli Lilly, Five Prime, Novartis, Roche, and Syndax.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our drug candidates, for example, ripretinib, DCC-3014, rebastinib, and DCC-3116, their methods of use, related technologies, and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform.
Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our drug candidates and other commercially important technologies, inventions, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
With regard to ripretinib, as of February 28, 2020, we own three issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims. The first issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2027, and two issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2032. In addition, we own related patents and pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia that will also expire in 2032. We also own one pending U.S. application, and related pending applications in Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia, as well as two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications directed to methods of using ripretinib, which if granted, will expire between 2037 and 2039. We also own three pending U.S. provisional patent applications directed to methods of using ripretinib, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these provisional applications is granted, would expire in 2040.
With regard to DCC-3014, as of February 28, 2020, we own one issued U.S. patent with composition of matter and method of use claims. The issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2034. In addition, we own related patents and pending applications in Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia that are expected to expire in 2034. We also own one pending U.S. 
application and one pending PCT patent application, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these patent applications is granted, would expire in 2039.
With regard to rebastinib, as of February 28, 2020, we own three issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2027 and 2034. In addition, we own related issued patents in Australia, Canada, Asia, and Europe which are expected to expire in 2027 and pending patent applications in certain jurisdictions that if issued will expire between 2027 and 2034. We also own one pending U.S. provisional application, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to this provisional application is granted, would expire in 2040.
With regard to DCC-3116, as of February 28, 2020, we own three pending U.S. provisional applications, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these provisional applications is granted, would expire in 2040.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the U.S., the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, as compensation for the loss of patent term during FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering ripretinib, DCC-3014, and rebastinib may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved drug candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform and certain aspects of our manufacturing processes and aspects of our kinase switch control platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and potential collaborators, such individuals may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state, and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, pricing, and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety, and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review, and approved by the regulatory authority.
Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the regulatory authority's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, debarment, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Drug Development
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical, sometimes referred to as nonclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA's good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a NDA for a new drug;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a NDA to file the NDA for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA's current good manufacturing practice requirements (cGMP);
•potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
The data required to support a NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: preclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the preclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation, and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology, and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on patient safety and the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection, and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials. Phase 1 trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effects, tolerability, and safety of the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve 
studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a drug during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of a NDA.
A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate's efficacy and safety such that it can serve as the primary basis for approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any finding from other clinical studies, tests in laboratory animals, or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive, and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long-term stability and quality of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
NDA and the FDA Review Process
Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA, along with proposed labeling for the drug and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure drug quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain adequate evidence of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive preclinical and clinical testing. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for a particular indication or indications to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
Under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA's fee schedule, effective from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an original NDA, is $2,942,965. The PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($325,424). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of an original NDA, the FDA reviews the application to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, including for failure to pay required fees, and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on whether to accept a NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the NDA. Under the performance goals established under the PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to review 90% of standard NDAs for new molecular entities (NMEs) in ten months from the filing date and 90% of priority NME NDAs in six months from the filing date. The goals for reviewing standard and priority non-NME NDAs are ten months and six months, respectively, measured from the receipt date of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drugs or drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In the course of its review, the FDA may re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of a NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving a NDA, the FDA typically conducts a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new drug to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. In addition, before approving a NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process, and manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, challenge the determination set forth in the letter by requesting a hearing, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the U.S. and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or patient subgroups, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse events be included in the drug labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved drugs. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug's safety and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved drugs that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A 
REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of drugs. Drug approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and BTD, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs intended to treat serious conditions that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the "filing" date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for NME, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track Designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or other clinical endpoint and to submit promotional materials for preapproval and pre-use review. In addition, the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies may also be eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
In addition, the FDA may review applications under RTOR, which, according to the FDA, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. Drugs considered for review under RTOR must be likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted BTD for the same or other indications, and must have straight-forward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted. RTOR allows the FDA to review much of the data in a NDA earlier, before the applicant formally submits the complete application. This analysis of the pre-submission package gives the FDA and applicants an early opportunity to address data quality and potential review issues and allows the FDA to provide early feedback regarding the most effective way to analyze data to properly address key regulatory questions.
Project Orbis is an initiative of the FDA's OCE and, according to the FDA, provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. For example, in December 2019, for ripretinib, we submitted our NDA to FDA, and filed an NDS with Health Canada and an AUS MAA with the TGA in Australia under Project Orbis.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of the expedited review programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be 
shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval, BTD, RTOR, and Project Orbis do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Trials
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, a NDA or supplement to a NDA for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug subject to PREA must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company and the approved drug are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, establishment registration and drug listing, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, the FDA takes the position that manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the drug or its labeling or changes of the site or process of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations. In the U.S., the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the PDMA), a part of the FDCA. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) was enacted in 2013 with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the U.S. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. The law's requirements include the quarantine and prompt investigation of a suspect product to determine if it is illegitimate, and notifying trading partners and the FDA of any illegitimate product. Drug manufacturers and their collaborators are also required to place a unique product identifier on prescription drug packages. This identifier consists of the National Drug Code, serial number, lot number, and expiration date, in the form of a 2-dimensional data matrix barcode that can be read by humans and machines.
In the U.S., once a drug is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. FDA regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific facilities per the NDA approval and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our drugs in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural, and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories, or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where 
applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute drugs manufactured, processed, or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a drug after approval may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the drug from the market, and may require substantial resources to correct.
The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans, and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial, or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities following drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. In the U.S., sales, marketing, and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or collectively, the ACA). If drugs are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In addition, our leasing and operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to certain U.S. environmental laws and regulations, under which current or previous owners or operators of real property and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination caused by hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases.
The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with a FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a trial.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the EU, the European Commission, after receiving the opinion of the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) grants Orphan Drug Designation to also promote the development of products. The relevant European legislation provides that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must also demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the product has to be of significant benefit compared to products available for the condition. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.
In the U.S., Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may 
not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
In the EU, Orphan Drug Designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the 27 member states that comprise the EU (the Member States) can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for the same therapeutic indication in respect of a "similar medicinal product." A "similar medicinal product" is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if, after five years, the Orphan Drug Designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
Some of our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic test to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the U.S., the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval application (PMA) approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA's evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval, or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for "In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices." According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
In the European Economic Area (EEA), in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance 
with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the European Conformity (CE) mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The in vitro diagnostic medical devices Directive is being replaced by a new Regulation in the EEA. The new Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) entered into force on 25 May 2017, and is subject to a 5 year transition period during which manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices must update their technical information and processes in line with the new Regulation. During the transition period, manufacturers may elect whether to put any new in vitro diagnostic devices under the Directive's regime or under the regulation of the new Regulation. Under European law, a Regulation differs from a Directive since it is directly effective in each Member State, without the need for implementing legislation (which is required for a Directive).
European Drug Development
In Europe, our future drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the Directive) has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU Member States where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the member state where they occurred.
In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 (the Regulation), replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) once the EU Portal and Database are fully functional. It is expected that the new Regulation will apply in late 2020. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting member state, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting member state shall consult and coordinate with the other Member States in which the clinical trial is to take place (such Member States being referred to as the Member States Concerned). If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all Member States Concerned. However, a Member State Concerned can in limited circumstances declare an "opt-out" from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that member state. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining an EU MAA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
The first is the Community EU MAA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure (CP), based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The CP is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune, and viral diseases. The CP is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
National EU MAAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the CP. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National EU MAA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National EU MAA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which 
the EU MAA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (SPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national EU MAA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the EU MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy.
European Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In Europe, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom (U.K.) 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remains applicable to the U.K. This transition period is due to end on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of Europe and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, which is a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data, developed by the World Medical Association.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurers, and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such third-party payors provide for our products. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products in which our products are used. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services.
In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor's determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, an agency within the HHS, as the CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and 
reimbursed under Medicare. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process may be a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the MDRP, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers' rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate percentage on most branded prescription drugs of average manufacturer price (AMP) and adding a new rebate calculation for "line extensions" (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates owed are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, while all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. These Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children's hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor's drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including:
•The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
•The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
The ACA has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the MDRP are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the MDRP and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
The ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer is required to pay a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee based 
on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The ACA also expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer's drugs under Medicaid. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B "ceiling price" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid programs and purchased by certain federal grantees and agencies, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies—the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Public Health Service, and the Coast Guard—that is at least 24% less than the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price (non-FAMP) for the prior fiscal year. 
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to reform through legislation and Executive Orders of the President of the U.S. (the U.S. President), and to judicial challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, referred to as the "individual mandate." However, the current U.S. presidential administration has indicated that enacting changes to the ACA is a legislative priority and has discussed repealing and replacing or amending the ACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Reform Act) includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business.
On January 20, 2017, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. On December 10, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States, which will determine whether the government must make risk corridor payments. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision will be released in the coming months, but we cannot predict how the U.S. Supreme Court will rule. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has recently published regulations that would give states greater flexibility starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Each chamber of Congress put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the ACA. Although none of these measures has been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA.
The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing or replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal or replacement on our business remains unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability and may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the current U.S. presidential administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the current U.S. presidential administration released a "Blueprint", or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (list price) of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current U.S. presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require HHS to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. 
Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that, if finalized, would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. The FDA also issued a draft guidance document outlining a potential pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code (NDC) for a FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The regulatory and market implications of the notice of proposed rulemaking and draft guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances.
Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Moreover, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Other Healthcare Laws
For our product and any product candidates that obtain regulatory approval and are marketed in the U.S., our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers, and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party on its behalf) to, knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, receive, or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual for or the purchase or recommendation of an item or for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of this law carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
•The anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program.
•Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates, relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties applicable to business associates, and gave state Attorneys General new authority to file civil actions for damage or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act), enacted as part of the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program for certain payments and other "transfers of value" provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. On January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
•Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from one another in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
In the U.S., to help patients afford our products, if approved, we plan to have various programs to assist them, including various patient assistance programs to help patients access our products, including co-pay coupons for eligible patients. In November 2013, CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Medicare Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons.
There has been enhanced scrutiny of industry supported independent patient assistance programs, such as donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, as well as other industry-sponsored reimbursement support offerings. The OIG has established guidelines for pharmaceutical manufacturers who make donations to charitable organizations providing co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor's product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight, and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties, and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company's attention from the business.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business.
European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
Employees
We have operated by leveraging skilled experts, consultants, contract research organizations, and contractors to manage our clinical operations, under the leadership and direction of our management. We will expand our infrastructure to manage our operations, including commercial with additional full-time employees.
As of February 28, 2020, we had 255 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees, 78 of whom hold Ph.D. and/or M.D. degrees. Of these employees, 168 were engaged in research and development activities and 90 were engaged in selling, general, and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Corporate Information, Initial Public Offering and Organizational Transactions
Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC was formed and commenced operations in 2003. Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on August 1, 2017, for the sole purpose of completing an initial public offering (IPO) and related transactions in order to carry on the business of Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC.
