Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on November 29, 2011, under the name Quatra-Rad, Inc. and our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our two directors. On February 29, 2012, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to Quarta-Rad, Inc. On July 16, 2012, we amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common stock to 50,000,000, $0.0001 par value from 1,500, no par value and effected a 10,000 to 1 forward split. On February 4, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Correction to our Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation to correct it for inadvertently excluding the 10,000 to 1 forward stock split, which our shareholders and directors approved on June 29, 2012. From November 29, 2011 (inception) through May 2012, we had limited operations. Commencing in May 2012, we began sales and implemented our business plan to distribute detection devices, including but not limited to Geiger counters, to homeowners and interested customers in North America by selling them on consignment on behalf of a related party owned by our majority shareholder and which are purchased from a company owned by our minority shareholder. We also purchase the products directly from the company owned by our minority shareholder and sell them to independent third party resellers. A Geiger counter is an instrument used for measuring ionizing radiation. It detects radiation such as Beta particles, Gamma rays and X-rays using the ionization produced in a Geiger–Müller tube, which gives its name to the instrument. We do not currently manufacture any of the products that we sell. We intend to continue to target homebuilders and home renovation contractors for the sale of products and resellers that market to these customers. Our business activities are now focused on expanding our Internet sales. We have established a fiscal year end of December 31. Initially we sold the products on consignment on behalf of Star Systems Corporation, a Japanese company owned by Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder, and purchase products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd., a Russian company owned by Alexey Golovanov, our minority shareholder, which we sell to independent third party resellers. Commencing in 2013, we began selling the products directly to third parties through Internet sales.
 
On November 29, 2011, we issued 1,500 pre-split shares of our no par value common stock, valued at $1 per share, to our 2 founders, which includes 1,200 pre-split common shares to our chief executive officer, Victor Shvetsky and 300 pre-split common shares to our president, Alexey Golovanov in exchange for organizational services incurred in our formation valued at $1,200 and $300, respectively. From November 29, 2011 to April 30, 2012, we did not incur any operational expenses. From May 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, our burn rate was approximately $1,488 per month and, in 2013, our month burn rate was approximately $5,525. Presently, our monthly burn rate is approximately $12,750 per month, which consists of general and administrative expenses, advertising and professional fees. We believe that our present capital is sufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months. However, we believe that we will require between $75,000 to $310,000 in cash in 2017 to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation. To the extent we are unable to accomplish our goals with the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, then we intend to use our existing cash or raise additional capital from investors through the sale of our common stock or from loans or advances from our majority shareholder. Our majority shareholder has orally agreed to advance us the funds without interest and has agreed to defer repayment until we are able to repay him. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we raised $65,230 from 34 investors through the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our registration statement.

Business
 
We commenced operations in May 2012, by selling products on consignment from a company owned by our majority shareholder. In 2012, we purchased products from a company owned by our minority shareholder and sold them to a company owned by our majority shareholder and to third party resellers. We believe the terms of those sales were arms-length. In 2012, we began use of the Internet as well as the services of an independent sales representative to market the products to homeowners and interested customers in North America and the majority of our sales were from unrelated third parties. We market the products to homebuilders and home renovation contractors. We have had limited operations and have limited financial resources. In 2011, our operations were devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational activities as well as related party and third party sales, which included:

1. | Formation of the Company; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Development of our business plan; 
3. | Evaluating various detection devices; 
4. | Research on marketing channels/strategies for our detection devices and the industry; 
5. | Secured our website domain www.quartarad.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; and 
6. | Research on future products to distribute. 
7. | Consignment sales on behalf of a related party. 
8. | Sales to third party resellers. 

 
In May 2012, we commenced our business operations by selling products on consignment from a related party company and developing our distribution network. In June 2012, we began to utilize our website to market the products we sell on consignment to our potential customers. We also began implementing our business plan by promoting these products for sale on various websites. We also engaged independent, third party distributors to sell the products. In 2013, increased our Internet presence and increased our sales whereby the majority of our sales were from unrelated third parties. From 2014 to the present, we have continued to sell the products through the Internet to unrelated third parties. See “Risk Factors.”
 
We believe that our principal source of revenue will continue to come from Internet sales and sales to resellers of the following products:
 
Radiation Detection Equipment
 
RADEX RD1503 – basic model of a hand-held radiation detector for the consumer market.
 
RADEX RD1706 – enhanced model of a hand-held radiation detector; additional radiation counter provides for a more accurate results (confirmed by JQA – Japan Quality Assurance organization), vibration alarm and several additional functions improve on the RD1503 design specifications.
 
RADEX RD1008 – high-end radiation detection device that provides readings for Gamma- and Beta- radiation values separately. Equivalent devices from other manufacturers cost 5-10 times more.
 
RADEX RD1212 – new model of hand-held radiation detector for the consumer market. It includes all the functionality of RD1503 model as well as ability to store measured values in memory for later transfer to PC. This device comes with newly developed software, RadexRead, developed by Quarta-Rad Inc further enhances RADEX family of Geiger counters by combining the power of PC and Internet, allowing user to visualize and share their measurements with other RADEX consumers.
 
RADEX RD1212-BT – upgraded version of RD1212 with Bluetooth, now capable of linking to smartphones or tablets to transfer data in real time. Also measures atmospheric pressure and air temperature. Special Android/iOS application for smartphones can be used alongside with this product.
 
RADEX RD ONE – compact personal radiation detector, smaller and less expensive than any of the other models. Besides the size, the device has additional features such as: counts accumulative dose, can display measurements in CPMs and links via USB cord to PC for data transfer and analysis. Other standard features include audio/vibration alarm and adjustable alarm thresholds like on all other models. New analytical software was created to chart and analyze received data.

Radon Detection Equipment
 
RADEX MR106N – Radon gas detector with digital read-out of the results (in volume of air); readings calculated every 4 hours and saved in the onboard memory log.
 
RADEX MR153N (TBD) – simple Radon gas detector that provides visual/audio alarm when a certain (or legal) threshold is reached.
 
EMI Detection Equipment
 
RADEX EMI50 – hand-held device that provides real-time measuring of Electric Field Strength (in kiloVolt/meter) and Electro Magnetic Field (in microTesla).
 
Light and brightness Detection Equipment
 
RADEX Lupin – Light Meter, Pulse meter and Lucimeter. A hand-held device that measure illumination, brightness and flicker ratio of LED screens, any type of light bulbs or monitors at work or at home. RadexLight Software allows PC connection and data transfer. Spectral sensitivity is identical to a human eye, which separates this model from the competition.
 
Although we have commenced our marketing sales campaign with our own resources and are selling products through online retailers and through resellers, we believe that we need additional capital to increase our sales and expand our marketing program. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to cost effectively purchase and sell the products and market them through the Internet and through distributors. We intend to rely on our Chairman and President’s relationships in the industry to supply us with products and introduce us to resellers. We also intend to market our website to the home renovation industry to solicit orders for the sale of products. There can be no guarantee or assurance that our Chairman or President and/or our website will enable us to purchase products on attractive terms that will allow us to resale them to independent third party distributors.
 
No assurance can be given that the products we purchase will be sold to resellers and, if sold to them, will return an investment or make a profit. To achieve the goal of purchasing products on favorable terms, we plan to be selective in our choice of suppliers and work with our shareholders’ companies as well as other cost-effective suppliers.
 
From November 29, 2011 (our inception) to December 31, 2011, we did not generate any sales. In 2012, we generated $51,405 in sales, which resulted in $29,110 in related party sales and resulted in a net profit of $25,783. In 2013, we generated $661,147 in sales, which included $37,431 in related party sales and a net profit of $112,992. In 2014, we generated $1,045,020, in net sales, which were all from third parties and incurred a loss of ($95,084). In 2015, we generated $829,032 in net sales and earned a profit of $50,463. In 2016, we generated $826,791 in sales and incurred a net loss of $(35,634). We anticipate that we will continue to generate revenues and will incur net profits and will be able to increase our revenues after we have raised additional funds. We believe that we have sufficient working capital to continue our operations for the next 12 months; however, we believe that we need to seek additional financing to expand our sales. As of December 31, 2016, we had $67,513 in cash on hand in our corporate bank account and liabilities of $79,103, which consisted of $78,103 in related party payables and $1,000 in accounts payable. We currently have two officers and directors. These individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and devote approximately 10 hours per week to us. From our inception through September 30, 2013, one of our shareholders, who is an officer or director and who owns 20% of our common stock, has sold us inventory to resell to a company owned by our majority shareholder. Subsequent to September 30, 2013, our sales have been to independent, third parties. Since May 2012, we have utilized the services of an independent contractor to assist us in selling the products. He is paid on a commission only basis.
 
Major advantages that can be capitalized on immediately are:
 

● | existing brand recognition of RADEX name; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | existing product line up that can be sold now; 
● | access to device library that are in the prototyping stage for a quicker push into production and sales phases; 
● | access to Quarta-Rad, Ltd. engineers and its proprietary tech library that would allow for quick prototyping and manufacture of devices based on reports from the field sales-force; and 
● | Exclusive distribution rights for the RADEX brand in the United States, Canada and the European Union 

 
Quarta-Rad, Ltd.’s proprietary tech library is combination of source code, database, firmware and hardware used for measuring and displaying radiation measurements. The source code is for the: (i) RD1212 web program; (ii) RD1212 BT application for Android and iPhone; (iii) Web RadexRead; and (iv) database of radiation measurements. The Web RadexRead and database of radiation measurements are owned, managed, and controlled by us. Quarta-Rad, Ltd. owns and controls the firmware source code used by all Radex series as well as the hardware design. Victor Shvetsky, our CEO, is in charge of developing and maintaining any technical libraries we own. Quarta-Rad, Ltd. owns any technical library components and maintains and updates them through its engineers, who are: Sergei Mamayev, Aleksander Demin, Dmitry Eiduk, and Dmitry Proskurin.

Financing Strategy
 
Our ability to increase our inventory will depend on additional outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall inventory planning and management will rest with our management. For each detection device product, we plan to purchase, management will need to assess the market and our financing needs to acquire product at cost-effective prices. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business control. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will be able to ever purchase product on cost-effect terms or employ independent distributors to effectively sell the products.
 
Once we determine our inventory needs, there are various methods of obtaining the funds needed to complete the purchase of the detection devices. Examples of financing alternatives include the assignment of our rights to purchase order financing. Alternatively, we may form a limited liability company or partnership where we will be the managing member or the general partner and raise funds to finance inventory. We may also obtain favorable pre-sales commitments from various customers such as home restoration contractors, distributors and developers. These various techniques, which are commonly used in the industry, can be combined to finance our inventory without a major bank financing.
 
Distribution Arrangements
 
Effective distribution is critical to the economic success of the detection devices, particularly when made by a small company without sufficient marketing resources. We have negotiated a few independent distribution agreements.
 
We intend to continue to distribute the products in the United States through existing independent distributors and the Internet. Our primary emphasis will be on marketing to homebuilders, home renovation contractors and general contractors. In addition, we intend to also target direct consumers via the Internet through online retailers and through national and regional retailers.
 
To the extent that we may engage in distribution of the products in foreign markets, we will be subject to all of the additional risks of doing business abroad including, but not limited to, government censorship, currency fluctuations, exchange controls, greater risk of “piracy” copying, and licensing or qualification fees.
 
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the nature of the distribution arrangements, if any, that we may secure for the detection devices we sell.
 
We believe that the catastrophic events such as the March 11, 2011 nuclear accident in Japan will drive consumers and the market to radiation detection devices and other detection devices will either be in demand from the construction community and will be cost effective for the consumer and the industry professional.
 
We believe that effective Internet advertising along with participation in trade shows is the quickest and most cost effective method to let consumers know about the products. Additionally, large resellers and distributors will require promotional packages that we will need to develop and produce.
 
Competition
 
The detection device industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as United Technologies Corporation, Radiation Alert, Osun Technologies, Lutron, General Tools, Mazur Instruments, First Alert, Inc./BRK Brands, Inc., which is wholly owned by Sunbeam Corporation, as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us.
 
The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of customer service, the quality of finished products and price. Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality finished products depends primarily on our manufacturers’ standards and the level of training of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver the Products we sell. We believe we will compete effectively in all of these areas.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer detection devices at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to obtain more experienced employees than we can.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We do not currently have any intellectual property rights. In the summer of 2013, Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder and director developed a software program called RadexRead, which Quarta-Rad, Ltd is using in the manufacture of its RD1212 products that we purchase as party of our inventory. We are not incurring any additional costs or benefits from Mr. Shvetsky’s ownership of this software and, there are no current plans for Mr. Shvetsky to sell the software to the Company or contribute it for additional shares of our common stock.

Status Of Any Publicity Announced New Products And Services
 
In late 2013, we began distributing a new product named RD1212, which we believe has a sleek new design. It has the ability to store measurements in internal memory and transfer this data to a personal computer (“PC”). The RadexRead software utilized in this device allows users to view values retrieved from the Geiger counter, map them on Google Maps, and share their data with other Radex users.
 
We estimate that the cost for us to purchase software from an independent party that performs the same functions as RadexRead would be approximately $30,000. This software allows us to retrieve data from the RD1212 device to a Windows PC, analyze it, and geo-tag the values and place them on Google Map. The software offers an interactive view of the world map with readings other Radex RD1212 users can, at their option, submit.
 
We believe RadexRead brings numerous advantages to us over our competition, specifically:
 

● | RadexRead distinguishes the products we sell from other Geiger counters in its price range by providing free visualization software; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | RadexRead, to the best of our knowledge, is the only software for Geiger counters in the RD1212 price range that allows users to mark radiation values collected by Geiger counters and place them on a map; 
● | RadexRead is the only software in this Geiger counter class that allows users to share their data with each other over the Internet; 
● | RadexRead is designed for use by users with little or no scientific background, making it simple and fun to collect, visualize and share radiation measurements with the community; and 
● | RadexRead allows us to further increase its visibility through collaboration with Safecast, a worldwide volunteer organization that collects radiation data. RadexRead gives user an option of saving data online and submit its radiation and geographical data shared with other users to Safecast monitoring network. 

 
We believe RadexRead has increased RADEX’s appeal over our competition and helped RD1212 become one of our top selling Geiger counters, despite the product’s manufacturer’s suggested retail price being almost forty percent higher than the previous top-selling device, the low-cost RD1503.
 
Our Website
 
Our website is located at www.quartarad.com and provides a description of our company, the products we sell and our contact information including our address, telephone number and e-mail address.
Dependence On Customers
 
Since November 29, 2011 (inception) through 2012, we were dependent upon a company owned by our minority shareholder for the purchase of the products we sold and a company owned by our majority shareholder for the sale of the commissionable products we sold. Beginning in 2013, the majority of our sales have been derived from third party Internet sales and resellers and, in 2015 and 2016, all of our sales have been derived from third party Internet sales and resellers.
Trademarks And Patents
 
We do not have any registered trademarks or patents.
 
Need for any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Sales of the products we sell on consignment or sell to independent, third party distributors and services we may provide internationally are subject to U.S. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import-export control. Violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation. Depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in the states we conduct business and the United States.
Research and Development
 
From our inception through September 30, 2014, we have not spent any money on research and development activities. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we have begun spending money on research and development for a new software program that we may license to others and $155,000 to our related party supplier for the development of a new product for us to sell. In 2016, we spent approximately. $4,000 on research and development with our related party. We have paid an independent contractor to improve and upgrade our website and Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder and director, has developed, at no cost to us, a software program called RadexRead, which we allow Quarta-Rad, Ltd. to use in the manufacture of the RD1212 products we purchase from them.

Basis of Presentation
 
These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in United States (US) dollar. The Company’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company does not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
 
Significant estimates made by management include, among others, provisions for the valuation of accounts receivable and the recoverability of inventory. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and belief of what could occur in the future considering available information. The Company reviews its estimates on an on-going basis. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from its estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payment awards to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of an entity’s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction is recognized as a liability; otherwise, the transaction is recognized as equity.
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50 “Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.” Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.

Advertising
 
The Company expenses advertising costs, consisting primarily of placement in multiple publications, along with design and printing costs of sales materials, when incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $15,028 and $10,994, respectively.
Income Taxes
 
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and, (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable upon examination, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties, if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified the U.S. federal and Delaware as our “major” tax jurisdictions. Generally, we remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2011 through 2016 Delaware Tax Returns. However, we have certain tax attribute carry forwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized.
 
We believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax position have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.
 
Inventory Accounting Policy
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company periodically reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of goods sold. The Company’s inventory consists of finished goods available for sale.
Earnings per Share
 
The Company’s basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing its net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company’s dilutive earnings per share is calculated by dividing its net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The Company‘s financial instruments as defined by FASB ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” include cash, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
FASB ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
 

● | Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
● | Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Revenue Recognition
 
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 101, Revenue Recognition, as amended by SAB 104, outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management believes that the Company’s revenue recognition policy conforms to SAB 101 and 104.
The Company evaluates the criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of revenue and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. The Company is the primary obligor, is subject to inventory risk and credit risk, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, and has input in establishing product specifications.
 
The Company imports the goods and pays the import and delivery costs and forwards the goods to a public warehouse. Goods are held by the Company at a public warehouse until the customers requested ship date. The Company arranging for the maintenance of the Goods while in the warehouse at its expense. The Company has title to the Goods when shipped from the manufacturer and in the public warehouse.
 
The Company believes it meets the indicators for gross reporting. The Company is the primary obligor, it has inventory risk, it has the ability to determine the price it sells the products to customers, it can change the product, it has supplier discretion, it can determine the nature, type, characteristics and specification of the products, it has physical risk of inventory as it purchases the products and assumes the risk of sale, and it has the credit risk for the customer to pay.
 
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods from the public warehouse to the customers, which is when title transfers to the customers.
 
Shipping and handling costs billed to the customers are recorded in sales. Shipping and handling costs as incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of sales.
 
The Company‘s financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an agreement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and goods have been delivered or services performed. Please refer to Note 5 for related party transactions. In 2013, the Company began reporting its revenues as gross revenues rather than net revenues since the Company’s revenues are from unrelated, third party sales rather than consignment sales for its related party.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The ASU eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires determining the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in a business combination. Under the amendments in this update, a goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance by the Company is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The ASU eliminates the APIC pool concept and requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded in the income statement when awards are settled. The pronouncement also addresses simplifications related to statement of cash flows classification, accounting for forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The primary impact of adopting the ASU will be the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies within income taxes, which will increase the volatility within our provision for income taxes as these excess amounts are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards vest or are exercised. The Company does not have any share-based awards to be recognized in any period. The Company does not expect the other provisions within the ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases previously classified as operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its financial statements but does expects the ASU to have a material impact on its financial position since it does not have any leases.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities. The ASU requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Under this ASU, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities in other comprehensive income, and they will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. The guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans is not impacted. ASU 2016-01 eliminates certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and adds disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for only certain portions of the ASU. The adoption of this guidance by the Company is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements since the Company does not have any equity investments.
 
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The ASU requires entities using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory costing method to subsequently value inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU requires prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance by the Company is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the ASU to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. The Company continues to evaluate the adoption of this standard and its subsequent related amendments and interpretations. However, based on our preliminary assessment, it does not expect the standard to materially affect our financial statements.

NOTE 3–INCOME TAXES
 

The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and California. The benefit from income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below:

 | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
-------------------------------+------+---------+---+------+--
Current: | | | | | 
Federal | $ | - | | | $ | - | 
State | | - | | | | - | 
Total current | | - | | | | - | 
Deferred: | | | | | | | 
Federal | | (12,116 | ) | | | (17,157 | )
State | | - | | | | - | 
Change in valuation allowance | | 12,116 | | | | 17,157 | 
Total deferred | | - | | | | - | 
Income tax provision (benefit) | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
At December 31, 2016, the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $95,084 which may be offset against future taxable income through 2036. No net deferred tax assets are recorded at December 31, 2016 or 2015, as all deferred tax assets and liabilities have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of future utilization.
 
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:
 

 | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
----------------------------------+------+---------+---+------+--
Net operating loss carry-forwards | $ | 27,287 | | | $ | 15,171 | 
Other | | - | | | | - | 
Total deferred tax assets | | 27,287 | | | | 15,171 | 
Less: valuation allowance | | (27,287 | ) | | | (15,171 | )
Net deferred tax assets | | - | | | | - | 

 
The change in the valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was an approximate $12,000 increase and an approximate $15,000 decrease, respectively and a full valuation allowance has been recorded since, in the judgement of management, these net deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible or are utilized.
 
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 to the effective tax rate is as follows:
 

 | 2016 | | | 2015
---------------------+------+--------+----+-----
Expected federal tax | | 34.00 | % | | 34.00 | % 
Valuation allowance | | (34.00 | )% | | (34.00 | )%
Total | | - | % | | - | % 

 
The Company follows FASB ASC 740-10, Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits or a liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not expect to have any unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if any, as part of income tax expense. There were no tax related interest and penalties recorded for 2016 and 2015. Since the Company incurred net operating losses in every tax year since inception, all of its income tax returns are subject to examination and adjustments by the IRS for at least three years following the year in which the tax attributes are utilized.

NOTE 4–STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
 

The Company was formed with one class of no par value common stock and was authorized to issue 1,500 common shares. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they chose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company.
 
From September 27, 2016 to December 20, 2016, the Company issued 326,150 shares of its $0.0001 par value common stock at a price of $0.20 for $65,230. The shares were sold pursuant to the Company’s effective registration statement. $5,000 of such funds were received in February and March 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2015, there are 15,326,150 shares of common stock outstanding.
 
NOTE 5–RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 

The Company sells radiation monitors and to date has purchased all of it inventory from a company in Russia, which is owned by the Company’s minority shareholder. Total inventory purchased was $564,444 and $548,416 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company owes the Russian affiliate $33,726 and $115,815 and such amount is included in related party payables in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The related payable balance is related to research and development costs incurred in 2014 and 2016. The Company’s majority shareholder and chief executive officer owns a company in Tokyo, Japan, which had an oral agreement with the Company to sell its inventory on Amazon.com for a 5% - 10% commission. The Company ceased such related party commission sales in 2012 and in 2013, the Company ceased selling products to this related party company.
 
Since inception, the Company has not compensated its CEO, who is the majority shareholder, and, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, is due $44,375 and $0, respectively.
 
NOTE 6– COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 

Legal
 
In the normal course of business, the Company may become involved in various legal proceedings. The Company knows of no pending or threatened legal proceeding to which the Company is or will be a party that, if successful, might result in material adverse change in the Company’s business, properties or financial condition.
NOTE 7–GOING CONCERN
 

The Company‘s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. While the Company has established sources of capital to cover its operating costs, it incurred a loss in 2016 and cannot support a salary for its CEO, which causes substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to implement its business plan. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
 
Management intends to focus on raising funds going forward. The Company cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that it will be able to raise funds. Potential investors must be aware if it is unable to raise funds through the sale of its common stock and generate sufficient revenues, any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety.
 
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 8–SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



The Company has performed an evaluation of events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2016 through April 6, 2017. Based on its evaluation, there is nothing to be disclosed herein.
