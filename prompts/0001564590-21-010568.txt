Item 1.  Business 
Overview 
 SpartanNash Company (together with its subsidiaries, “SpartanNash” or the “Company”) is a Fortune 400 company whose core businesses include distributing grocery products to a diverse group of independent and chain retailers, its corporate owned retail stores, and U.S. military commissaries and exchanges. SpartanNash serves customer locations in all 50 United States (“U.S.”), the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt. The Company’s Retail segment operates supermarkets that have a “neighborhood market” focus to distinguish them from supercenters and limited assortment stores. Through its Military segment, the Company is the exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand products to U.S. military commissaries. The Company operates three reportable segments: Food Distribution, Retail and Military. While the Company supports overseas commissaries and exchanges, all of the Company’s sales and assets are in the United States of America.
 The Company’s fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. The following discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ending or ended January 1, 2022 ("2021"), January 2, 2021 (“2020” or “current year”), December 28, 2019 (“2019” or “prior year”) and December 29, 2018 (“2018”), all of which include 52 weeks, with the exception of 2020, which includes 53 weeks. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company’s first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will usually include the Easter holiday. Fiscal 2020 contains 53 weeks; therefore, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 contains 13 weeks. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year’s holiday.
 The Company’s differentiated business model of Food Distribution, Retail and Military operations leverages the complementary nature of each segment and supports the ability of the Company’s independent retailers to compete in the grocery industry in the long-term. The model produces operational efficiencies, helps stimulate distribution product demand, and provides greater visibility and broader business growth options.
 SpartanNash’s mission is to leverage its expertise in food distribution and retail to develop, activate and provide impactful solutions that exceed expectations for customers, business partners and associates, and its vision is to be “A best-in-class business that feels local, where relationships matter.” In order to support these objectives, the Company’s priorities include strategies to improve the associate experience, to enhance the product offerings to customers, and to improve operational efficiency through achieving sustained improvements in gross margin and service levels.
 Food Distribution Segment 
 The Company’s Food Distribution segment uses a multi-channel sales approach to distribute grocery products to independent retailers, national retailers, food service distributors, e-commerce providers, and the Company’s corporate owned retail stores. Total net sales from the Company’s Food Distribution segment, including sales to corporate owned retail stores that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, totaled $5.7 billion for 2020. As of the end of 2020, the Company believes it is the fifth largest wholesale distributor, in terms of annual revenue, to supermarkets in the United States. 
 The Company is focused on growth in its Food Distribution segment, through expanded partnerships with existing customers, new business, and rounding out its assortment. The Company is also working to improve the reach and efficiency of its supply chain to drive improved profitability. 
 The Company’s Food Distribution segment supplies grocery products to a diverse group of independent retailers with operations ranging from a single store to regional supermarket chains, food service distributors and the Company’s corporate owned retail stores. As of January 2, 2021, the Company operated in all 50 states by leveraging a platform of 19 distribution centers, as well as internal transportation fleets and third-party shipping partners, servicing the Food Distribution and Military segments. The Company’s extensive geographic reach drives economies of scale and provides opportunities for independent retailers to purchase products at competitive prices in order to effectively compete in the grocery industry in the long-term. 
 The Company also services national retailers through a variety of platforms and has diversified its customer base through growth with these customers. These national retailers partner with the Company to centralize their supply of grocery products or product categories, and to leverage the Company’s broad geographic reach. Sales to one of the Company’s customers in the Food Distribution segment accounted for 17%, 17% and 16% of consolidated net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No other individual customer exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in any of the years presented.  
 The Company’s ten largest Food Distribution customers (excluding corporate owned retail stores) accounted for approximately 64% of total Food Distribution net sales for 2020. Approximately 89% of Food Distribution net sales for 2020 are covered under supply agreements with customers.

The Company’s Food Distribution segment provides a selection of approximately 68,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) of nationally branded and private brand grocery products and perishable food products, including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products, health and beauty care products and pharmacy. These product offerings, along with best-in-class services, allow independent retailers the opportunity to support the majority of their operations with a single supplier. The Company also provides a comprehensive menu of valued-added services designed to assist independent retailers in becoming more profitable, efficient, competitive, and informed, ranging from real estate and site surveys to a full suite of accounting, information technology and merchandising and marketing solutions. The Company is committed to sharing the expertise gained in its Retail operations with its independent customers.
 The Food Distribution segment competes directly with a number of traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems. In addition, the Company’s independent customers face intense competition from supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company partners with these customers to help them compete effectively. The primary competitive factors in the Food Distribution business include price, service level, product quality, variety and other value-added services.
 Retail Segment 
 As of January 2, 2021, the Company operates 156 corporate owned retail stores and 37 fuel centers in nine states in the Midwest, primarily under the banners of Family Fare, Martin’s Super Markets, D&W Fresh Market, VG’s Grocery and Dan’s Supermarket. Retail banners and store counts are fully detailed in Item 2, “Properties”. The Company’s corporate owned retail stores range in size from approximately 14,000 to 90,000 total square feet, or on average, approximately 44,000 total square feet per store.
 The Company’s neighborhood market strategy distinguishes its corporate owned retail stores from supercenters and limited assortment stores. Through e-commerce solutions, including Fast Lane and Groceries to GO, as well as third-party providers, the Company offered online grocery shopping and curbside pickup or delivery at 117 of its corporate owned retail locations as of January 2, 2021. This channel is highly valued by customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continuing to enhance and grow this platform is a key component of the Company’s strategy. The Company continues to make investments to support its online ordering systems, the speed and convenience of curbside pickup, and the efficiency and completeness of order fulfillment. 
 The Company’s corporate owned retail stores offer nationally branded and private brand grocery products, as well as perishable food products including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, including store prepared “grab and go” meal options, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, health and beauty care products and fuel. Sixty-seven of the Company’s stores contain franchised Starbucks or Caribou Coffee shops, which enhance the customer experience and help to drive traffic. Private brand grocery products typically generate higher retail margins while also improving customer loyalty by offering quality products at affordable prices.
 As of January 2, 2021, the Company offers pharmacy services in 97 of its corporate owned retail stores (87 of the pharmacies are owned) and operates one free-standing pharmacy location. The Company believes the pharmacy service offering in its corporate owned retail stores is an important part of the consumer experience. Most of the Company’s pharmacies offer certain free medications, along with low cost generic drugs, and meal planning solutions for preventative health and education for its customers. Influenza vaccinations and COVID-19 testing are available in certain pharmacies. The Company’s pharmacies will also offer COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021.
 The following chart details the changes in the number of corporate owned retail stores over the last five fiscal years:
  
 | 2016 | | 2017 | | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 
-------------------------------------------+------+-----+------+-----+------+------+------+----
Number of stores at beginning of year | | 163 | | 157 | | 145 | | 139 | 156
Stores acquired or constructed during year | | — | | — | | — | | 24 | 1 
Stores closed or sold during year | | 6 | | 12 | | 6 | | 7 | 1 
Number of stores at end of year | | 157 | | 145 | | 139 | | 156 | 156

 Early in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company made the decision to close two corporate owned retail stores in support of its initiatives related to retail store rationalization.   
 The principal competitive factors in the Retail business include the location and image of the store; the price, quality and variety of the fresh offering; and the quality, convenience and consistency of service. In addition to competing with traditional grocery stores, the Company competes with supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company monitors planned competitive store openings and uses established proactive strategies to respond to new competition both before and after competitive store openings. Strategies to react to competition vary based on many factors, such as the competitor’s format, strengths, weaknesses, pricing and sales focus.

Military Segment 
 The Company’s Military segment contracts with manufacturers and brokers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products, including dry groceries, beverages, meat, and frozen foods, primarily to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges. The Company’s Military segment, together with its third-party partner, Coastal Pacific Food Distributors (“CPFD”), represents the only delivery solution to service the Defense Commissary Agency (“DeCA” or “the Agency”) worldwide.
 DeCA operates a chain of 236 commissaries on U.S. military installations across the world that sells approximately $4.5 billion of grocery products annually. The Company distributes grocery products to 160 military commissaries and over 400 exchanges located in 39 states across the United States and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt. The Company’s distribution centers are strategically located among the largest concentration of military bases in the areas the Company serves and near Atlantic ports used to ship grocery products to overseas commissaries and exchanges. 
 The Company is also the DeCA exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand grocery and related products to all U.S. military commissaries. In accordance with its contract with DeCA, the Company procures the grocery and related products from various manufacturers and upon receiving customer orders from DeCA either delivers the products to the U.S. military commissaries itself or engages CPFD to deliver the products on its behalf. There are over 1,000 SKUs of private brand products in the DeCA system as of January 2, 2021. 
 DeCA contracts with manufacturers to obtain nationally branded products for the commissary system. Manufacturers either deliver the products to the commissaries themselves or, more commonly, contract with distributors such as SpartanNash to deliver the products. The Company obtains distribution contracts with manufacturers through competitive bidding processes and direct negotiations. As of January 2, 2021, the Company has approximately 250 distribution contracts representing approximately 600 manufacturers that supply products to the DeCA commissary system and various exchange systems. Generally, larger contracts or those subject to a request-for-proposal process have definitive durations, whereas smaller contracts generally have indefinite terms; and all contract types allow for termination by either party without cause upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party. The contracts typically specify which commissaries and exchanges to supply on behalf of the manufacturer, the manufacturer’s products to be supplied, service and delivery requirements, and pricing and payment terms. The Company’s ten largest manufacturer customers represented approximately 51% of the Company’s Military segment sales for 2020. 
 The Company’s strategies within the Military segment are focused on improving the profitability of its operations through partnering with DeCA and its manufacturer customers to identify growth opportunities and improve gross margins. The Company is also working to improve the efficiency of its supply chain through operational improvements, including identifying opportunities to optimize ordering, routes, and delivery schedules.
 The Company is one of fewer than five distributors in the United States with annual sales to the DeCA commissary system in excess of $100 million that distributes products via the frequent delivery system. The remaining distributors that supply DeCA tend to be smaller regional and local providers. In addition, manufacturers contract with others to deliver certain products, such as baking supplies, produce, delicatessen items, soft drinks and snack items, directly to DeCA commissaries and service exchanges. Because of the low margins in this industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale, which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases within the geographic area(s) a distributor serves. As a result, no single distributor in this industry, by itself, has a nationwide presence. Rather, distributors generally concentrate on specific regions, or areas within specific regions, where they can achieve critical mass and utilize warehouse and distribution facilities efficiently. In addition, distributors that operate larger non-military specific distribution businesses tend to compete for DeCA commissary business in areas where such business would enable them to more efficiently utilize the capacity of their existing distribution centers. The Company believes the principal competitive factors among distributors within this industry are customer service, price, operating efficiencies, reputation with DeCA and location of distribution centers.
 Supply Chain Network
 The Company’s distribution network is comprised of 19 distribution centers, which are utilized to service the Food Distribution and Military segments. The Company warehouses product through approximately 8.4 million square feet of distribution center space. The Company operates a fleet with 553 over-the-road tractors, 25 refrigerated straight trucks, 335 dry vans and 1,135 refrigerated trailers. The Company carefully manages the more than 73 million miles driven by its fleet and third-party carriers annually servicing military commissaries, exchanges, independent retailers, national retailers and corporate owned retail stores.
 The Company’s supply chain operations are focused on supporting growth and maximizing productivity through the optimization of its network and investment in technology. The Company continually evaluates its network and is contemplating or undertaking actions such as adding or consolidating locations and shifting volume between facilities as needed. System enhancements in the areas of forecasting and replenishment will support the strategic optimization of inventory, allowing for reductions in quantities on hand and space savings in the warehouses, while maintaining service levels and reducing shrink. The Company’s plan to consolidate transportation management information systems will also streamline operations and reduce miles traveled.

The Company is also investing in its workforce and has identified the areas of recruiting and training as some of the initiatives to improve supply chain performance and the overall associate experience. In the coming year, the Company plans to re-profile certain of its warehouses, and is in the process of developing dynamic slotting capabilities, in order to improve order selection efficiency and maximize space utilization. Process improvements are also underway in other areas of warehouse operations, including refining engineered labor standards to improve the productivity of the workforce. 
 Marketing and Merchandizing 
 During 2020, the Company leveraged data and insights to develop and implement strategies to respond to changes in consumer behavior in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic with products, meal solutions and marketing tactics in support of each of the Company’s segments. While impacts of COVID-19 are expected to be short term, the Company is proving its ability to use data and analytics to discern changing consumer needs and leverage these insights to drive performance.
 The Company’s Customer Growth strategy is focused on meeting changing customer needs and preferences through a data-based decision-making process, while also increasing customer satisfaction through quality service and convenience. The Company is using insights gained through its collaboration with dunnhumby to improve its positioning and assortment to better appeal to its customers. Key focus areas include improvement in customers’ perception of Company pricing, product assortment and the penetration of the Company’s private brands. As the Company works to better differentiate its Retail stores and implement its Customer Growth strategy, the Company has launched a new pricing strategy designed to highlight value and increase customer loyalty. The Company has developed processes to measure the activation of these strategies as well as their impacts. These measures are reviewed continuously to refine and evolve the strategies. The Company will continue to share its best practices across its independent customer base within the Food Distribution segment as it gains further insights. 
 The Company is selectively adding products and services to better meet customers’ changing needs and enhance their experience. During 2020, the Company undertook a complete review of the current private brand offering and go-to-market strategy. To build awareness and encourage associate engagement, the Company has transitioned from the private brands terminology to a proprietary, branded approach referred to as “OwnBrands”. This change has been executed as part of a broader plan to simplify the brand portfolio and build on the strength of the Company’s flagship brand, Our Family. 
 The Company has also been building tools and capabilities to enable relevant, personalized content across its digital, social media and mobile channels, including the use of chatbots with artificial intelligence, which provide immediate responses to customers’ frequently asked questions online. Additionally, the Company continues to focus on the growth of its e-commerce platforms and development of its fulfillment capabilities, which enable a highly personalized digital shopping experience, while driving operational efficiencies. These enhancements will contribute to the Company’s ability to build longer-term customer loyalty through convenience and value, maintain efficient marketing spend, improve its growth opportunities, and further strengthen its competitive position.
 Seasonality 
 The majority of the Company’s revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, in some geographies, corporate retail stores and independent retail customers are dependent on tourism, and therefore, are affected by seasons and weather patterns. 
Suppliers 
 The Company purchases products from a large number of national, regional and local suppliers of name brand and OwnBrand merchandise. No single supplier accounts for more than 5% of the Company’s purchases. The Company continues to develop strategic relationships with key suppliers and believes this will prove valuable in the development of enhanced promotional programs and consumer value perceptions. 
Intellectual Property 
 The Company owns valuable intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, and other proprietary information, some of which are of material importance to its business. 
 Technology 
 In 2020, the Company focused on digitizing efforts across all business segments, including the transition to a hybrid cloud model, where certain production environments are hosted in the cloud and disaster recovery environments are hosted in on-premise data centers. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company supported the shift of the corporate office workforce to a work-from-home environment, while maintaining workforce productivity. 
 Supply Chain. The Company began making meaningful upgrades to its transportation systems, including standardization of processes and rationalization of several disparate systems into a single integrated stack. Additionally, the Company completed the automation of its timekeeping, scheduling, and payroll management processes across its distribution network. These automation initiatives, combined with the workforce investments noted previously, are expected to contribute to improved hiring, retention and productivity.

Retail. During 2020, the Company made significant progress in the financial integration of its recently acquired Martin’s business. The Company is taking additional steps to modernize its retail applications footprint, beginning in 2021 with a comprehensive effort to upgrade and digitize its point-of-sale (“POS”) environment. The upgraded POS applications will include an integrated feature set which will enhance the retail experience both for SpartanNash and its independent customers. Additionally, the Company completed the implementation of a fresh item management solution for its corporate retail stores. This solution incorporates automated labeling, production planning, inventory and recipe management across all locations to support the fresh food operations within the corporate retail stores.
 
Marketing and Merchandizing: In 2020, the Company began the implementation of a cloud-based pricing and promotion automation solution. The new technology will provide a vendor portal and workflow management for promotional activities, as well as manage associated vendor billings.
 Administrative Systems, Infrastructure and Security. The Company has begun the development and implementation of tools to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of internal reporting and administrative functions. A centralized data analytics solution is being developed to consolidate the Company’s analysis and reporting platforms, introducing predictive data analytics capabilities to provide better business insights. Robotic process automation initiatives have been implemented in certain areas and additional areas are being evaluated for further automation, which will result in improved efficiency in repetitive, manual processes. The Company also successfully completed the deployment of a new Human Capital Management system which will act as the backbone of simplified digital human resources operations. During 2020, the Company also made other significant improvements to its networks and information security.
Human Capital
 The Company’s associates are critical to supporting the organization’s mission and values. The Company’s strategies are aligned to improve associate engagement and empowerment to foster an agile, highly accountable, performance-driven culture. As of January 2, 2021, the Company employed approximately 18,000 associates, 10,800 on a full-time basis and 7,200 on a part-time basis. 
Retention
 Attracting and retaining talent is imperative to accomplish the key initiatives of the Company. The Company’s primary initiatives in this area include ensuring a safe and desirable work environment, maintaining a competitive and compelling total rewards offer and investing in leadership and associate development. 
 While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the rate of turnover, specifically in the retail and distribution environments, the Company is committed to reducing turnover, with an established target reduction in the coming year.
 Safety
 Associate safety remains a top priority of the Company, particularly in the retail and distribution environments considering the effects of COVID-19 in the current year. The Company maintains robust policies and supports continuous training to ensure the safety of each associate and compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. The Company’s areas of focus include limiting incident rates, the frequency and severity of accidents and the cost of claims and settlements. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 The Company sponsors initiatives to differentiate its workforce with a focus on diversity and inclusion, to best reflect the communities it serves and to strengthen the representation of veterans, people of color, differently abled individuals and women in the workforce. The Company believes that valuing each associate’s talent and diverse perspective creates a fair and inclusive atmosphere for growth and success. 
 The Company also believes that it is best served by an executive leadership team and Board of Directors that have diverse perspectives, education, experience, skills, gender, race, and ethnicity, and will endeavor to seek out such candidates when searching for new leaders and directors. Of the eight current members of the executive leadership team, one member is a person of color and three members are female. Of the ten current members of the Board of Directors, two of the directors are persons of color and three of the directors are female.
 Engagement 
 The Company continually evaluates associate engagement and views the associated metrics as critical to the ability to attract and retain talent, contributing to many of the broader objectives of the Company. The results from annual associate engagement surveys are used to inform the Company’s priorities and provide valuable feedback on existing associate programs. During the last annual associate engagement survey completed in September, the Company achieved a 70% engagement rate, well above the industry average. The Company also launched a new corporate social media application in the current year, SpartanNash Go, as a tool to support engagement of associates across the organization. To-date, the Company’s adoption and engagement of the tool has exceeded expectations.

Compensation and Benefits
 The Company’s programs are designed to provide compensation and benefits packages that will attract, retain, reward, and inspire its associates to achieve a high level of performance, to challenge convention and turn problems into possibilities. Overall compensation and benefits are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain competitive with respect to industry benchmarks. The Company’s incentive programs are designed to align the associate’s financial interests with that of shareholders and other stakeholders. In addition, the Company periodically sponsors recognition and compensation initiatives for retail and distribution associates working on the front lines. These programs are designed to recognize the efforts of these workers for their commitment to serve customers and keep them safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to recognize their other outstanding achievements. Recently, the Company implemented a new human capital management system, which represents a key investment to provide resources related to compensation and benefits to associates.
Environmental Matters
 The Company may be responsible for remediation of environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liabilities relating to its stores, warehouses, and other buildings and the land on which they are situated (including responsibility and liability related to its operation of its fuel centers and truck garages and the storage of petroleum products in underground storage tanks). The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations, and in the past has conducted its operations, in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Also, the Company typically conducts an environmental review prior to acquiring or leasing buildings or raw land. However, the Company cannot always control or predict what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its facilities, and future changes in regulations may result in liabilities to the Company or increases in the cost of doing business.
Regulation 
 The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the conduct of its business, including those pertaining to the workforce and the purchase, handling, sale and transportation of its products. Many of the Company’s products are subject to federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA) regulation. The Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with the FDA, USDA and other federal, state and local laws and regulations governing its businesses.
