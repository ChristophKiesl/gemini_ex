 BUSINESS OUTLOOK
 During 2020 our annual revenue declined approximately $19.9 million or 1.6% from the revenue level achieved in 2019. This decrease in revenue for 2020 compared to 2019 reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on the Company and the world-wide economy. We continue to work towards our previously stated goals for 2025 of $1.0 billion in gross profit which represents $2.5 billion in revenue and a gross margin of 40%. Acquisitions remain a key part of our growth strategy to reach our revenue goal and in November 2020 we acquired Lite-On Semiconductor Corporation (“LSC”) and its subsidiaries.  The acquisition of LSC broadens our discrete product offerings, including providing us with a leadership position in glass-passivated bridges and rectifiers that will allow us to further extend our position in the automotive and industrial market spaces consistent with Diodes’ overall growth strategy.  Further, the acquisition expands our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity and provides us an opportunity to improve LSC’s profitability through operating and manufacturing improvements as well as increased factory utilization. 
We have a solid pipeline of designs and expanded customer relationships across all regions and product lines. The success of our business depends on, among other factors, the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, our customers’ demand for our products, the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations, the likelihood of customers not canceling or deferring existing orders, and the strength of consumers’ demand for items containing our products in the end-markets we serve. We believe the long-term outlook for our business remains generally favorable, despite the uncertainties in the global economy, as we continue to execute on the strategy that has proven successful for us over the years. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Outlook” in Part II, Item 7 and “Risk Factors – The success of our business depends on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets, and any weaknesses in these areas may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.  
 SEGMENT INFORMATION AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE DISCLOSURES 
 For financial reporting purposes, we operate in a single segment, standard semiconductor products, through our various design, manufacturing and distribution facilities. We sell product primarily through our operations in Asia, North America and Europe. See Note 16 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for addition information. 
OUR INDUSTRY
 Semiconductors are critical components used to manufacture of a broad range of electronic products and systems. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, continuous improvements in semiconductor processes and design technologies have led to smaller, more complex and more reliable devices at a lower cost per function. The availability of low-cost semiconductors, together with increased customer demand for sophisticated electronic systems, has led to the proliferation of semiconductors in diverse end-use applications. 
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 
 We believe our competitive strengths include the following: 
 Flexible, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing – Our manufacturing operations are a core element of our success, and we have designed our manufacturing base to allow us to respond quickly to changes in demand trends in the end-markets we serve. For example, we have structured our assembly and test facilities to enable us to rapidly and efficiently add capacity and adjust product mix to meet shifts in customer demand and overall market trends. Our manufacturing facilities located in Shanghai and Chengdu provide us with access to a workforce at a relatively low overall cost base while enabling us to better serve our leading customers, many of which are located in Asia. See “Risk Factors – During times of difficult market conditions, our fixed costs combined with lower net sales and lower profit margins may have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Integrated packaging expertise – Our expertise in designing and manufacturing innovative and proprietary packaging solutions enables us to package a variety of different device functions into an assortment of packages ranging from miniature chip-scale packaging to packages that integrate multiple separate discrete and/or analog chips into a single semiconductor product called an array. Our ability to design and manufacture multi-chip semiconductor solutions as well as advanced integrated devices provides our customers with products of equivalent functionality with fewer individual parts, and at lower overall cost, than alternative products. This combination of integration, functionality and miniaturization makes our products well suited for high-volume consumer electronic devices such as appliances, chargers, digital cameras, DVD and Blu-Ray players, global positioning devices, lighting, LED televisions, LCD panels, set-top boxes and consumer portables such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks. 
 Broad customer base and diverse end-markets – Our customers are comprised of leading direct sales customers as well as major electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers. Overall, we serve 334 direct sales customers worldwide and tens of thousands of additional customers through our 121 distributors. Our products are ultimately used in end-products in a number of markets served by our broad customer base, which we believe makes us less susceptible to market fluctuations driven by either specific customers or specific end-user applications.   
 Customer-focused product development – Effective collaboration with our customers and a commitment to customer service are essential elements of our business. We believe focusing on dependable delivery and support tailored to specific end-user applications has fostered deep customer relationships and created a key competitive advantage for us in the highly fragmented discrete, logic and analog and mixed-signal semiconductor marketplace. We believe our close relationships with our customers have provided us with keener insight into our customers’ product needs. This results in a stronger demand for our product designs and often provides us with insight into additional opportunities for new design wins in our customers’ products. See “Risk Factors – We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Management experience –The members of our executive team average over 30 years of industry experience, and the length of their service has created significant institutional insight into our markets, our customers and our operations. See “Risk Factors – We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.

OUR STRATEGY 
 Our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a leading global designer, manufacturer and supplier of high-quality application-specific standard semiconductor products, utilizing our innovative and cost-effective assembly and test (packaging) technology and leveraging our process expertise and design excellence to achieve above-market growth in profitability. 
 The principal elements of our strategy include the following: 
 Continue to rapidly introduce innovative discrete, logic and analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products – We intend to maintain our rapid pace of new product introductions, especially for high-volume, high-growth applications with short design cycles, such as  LCD and LED televisions and panels, set-top boxes, portables such as smartphones, tablets and notebooks along with other consumer electronics and computing devices, as well as added emphasis on products for the LED lighting market and the industrial and automotive markets. During 2020 and 2019, we continued to achieve many significant new design wins with our direct sales customers. Although a design win from a customer does not necessarily guarantee future sales to that customer, we believe that continued introduction of new and well-defined product solutions is critically important in maintaining and extending our market share in the highly competitive semiconductor marketplace. See “Risk Factors – Obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Expand our available market opportunities – We believe we have many paths to increasing our addressable market opportunity. From a product perspective, we intend to continue expanding our product portfolio by developing derivative and enhanced performance devices that target adjacent markets and end-equipment. We will continue to cultivate new and emerging customers within our targeted markets, further increasing our already broad customer base. As we focus on new customers, we try to expand our product portfolio penetration within these new, as well as existing, customers. As we expand our extensive range of high power efficiency and small form factor packages, we plan to introduce new and existing product functions in these new packages to allow an even greater market coverage. 
 Maintain intense customer focus – We intend to continue to strengthen and deepen our customer relationships. We believe that continued focus on customer service is important and will help to increase our net sales, operating performance and market share. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to closely collaborate with our customers to design products that meet their specific needs. A critical element of this strategy is to further reduce our design cycle time in order to quickly provide our customers with innovative products. Additionally, to support our customer-focused strategy, we continue to expand our sales force and field application engineers, particularly in Asia and Europe, during periods of growth. See “Risk Factors – We are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Enhance cost competitiveness – A key element of our success is our overall low-cost manufacturing base. While we believe our manufacturing facilities are among the most efficient in the industry, we will continue to refine our proprietary manufacturing processes and technology to achieve additional cost efficiencies. We have continued to make capital expenditures to enhance our existing manufacturing capabilities. 
 Pursue selective strategic acquisitions – As part of our strategy to expand our semiconductor product offerings and to maximize our market opportunities, we may acquire technologies, product lines or companies in order to enhance our product portfolio and accelerate our new product offerings. Since 2006 we have acquired a number of companies that enhanced our product portfolio, including Pericom Semiconductor Corporation (“Pericom”) in 2015. In 2019, we acquired from Texas Instruments a 200mm wafer fabrication facility and operations located in Greenock, Scotland (“GFAB”).  The acquisition of GFAB adds to our existing global footprint, but also provides expanded wafer capacity to support our product growth, in particular for the automotive market. In November 2020 we acquired Lite-On Semiconductor Corporation (“LSC”) and its subsidiaries.  The acquisition of LSC broadens our discrete product offerings, including providing us with a leadership position in glass-passivated bridges and rectifiers that will allow us to further extend our position in the automotive and industrial market spaces consistent with Diodes’ overall growth strategy.  Further, the acquisition expands our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity and provides us an opportunity to improve LSC’s profitability through operating and manufacturing improvements as well as increased factory utilization.
See “Risk Factors – Part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A and Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Annual Report for additional information.

For the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, our direct sales and EMS customers together accounted for 41%, 33% and 29%, respectively, of our net sales. One customer, a broad-based distributor serving thousands of customers, accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2019 and 2018, but not 10% of our outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 or 2019.  In addition, for information concerning our business with related parties, see “Business – Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” 
 We believe that our close relationships with our customers have provided us with deeper insight into our customers’ product needs. In addition to seeking to expand relationships with our existing customers, our strategy is to pursue new customers and diversify our customer base by focusing on leading global consumer electronics companies and their EMS providers and distributors. See “Risk Factors – Our customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of product sales and may demand to audit our operations from time to time.  A failure to qualify a product or a negative audit finding could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Subject to certain exceptions, our standard warranty extends for a period of one year from the date of shipment. Warranty expense has not been significant. Generally, our customers may cancel orders on short notice without incurring a penalty. See “Risk Factors – Our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. High volumes of order cancellation or reduction in quantities ordered could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.

easy access to our worldwide sales contacts and customer support and incorporates a distributor-inventory check to provide component inventory availability. 
 MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES 
 Historically we have operated two assembly and test facilities located in Shanghai, China, two in Chengdu, China and one in Neuhaus, Germany. We have two wafer fabrication facilities located in Shanghai, one 150mm and another capable of both 150mm and 200mm, a 150mm wafer fabrication facility located in Oldham, U.K. and GFAB, a 150mm and 200mm capable wafer fabrication facility located in Greenock, Scotland that we acquired in 2019.  With the acquisition of LSC in 2020 we added four wafer fabrication facilities, two in Taiwan and two in China, and three assembly facilities, two in China and one in Taiwan.
 In 2010, we entered into an agreement with the Management Committee of the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone (the “CDHT”). In connection with the agreement with CDHT, we formed a joint venture entity with a Chinese company, Chengdu Ya Guang Electronic Company Limited (“Ya Guang”), to establish a semiconductor assembly and test manufacturing facility in Chengdu, China. We currently own approximately 98% of the equity of the joint venture entity. The CDHT granted the joint venture entity a 50-year land lease, provides corporate and employee tax incentives, tax refunds, subsidies and other financial support. We believe this arrangement will be a long-term, multi-year project that will provide us additional capacity as needed. As of December 31, 2020, we have invested in this joint venture approximately $193.7 million, primarily for infrastructure, buildings and equipment-related capital expenditures. For the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total capital expenditures were approximately $75.8 million and $96.2 million, respectively. The majority of our capital expenditures are in China. 
 Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, aluminum and copper lead frames, gold and copper wire and other metals, molding compounds and various chemicals and gases. We also rely on equipment and finished product suppliers.  We are continuously evaluating our raw material costs in order to reduce our consumption while protecting and maintaining product performance. We have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead-times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. See “Risk Factors – We depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, manufacturing services, product and process development, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our reputation with customers, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in a facility we own in Plano, Texas. We also lease or own properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices, research and development centers, manufacturing facilities, warehouses and logistics centers. The size or location of these properties can change from time to time based on our business requirements. See “Properties” in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 BACKLOG 
 The amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent upon various factors, and orders are subject to cancellation or modification, usually with no penalty to the customer. Orders are generally booked from one month to greater than twelve months in advance of delivery. The rate of booking of new orders can vary significantly from month to month. We, and the industry as a whole, continue to experience a trend towards shorter customer-requested lead-times, and we expect this trend to continue. The amount of backlog at any date depends upon various factors, including the timing of the receipt of orders, fluctuations in orders of existing product lines, and the introduction of new product lines. Accordingly, we believe that the amount of our backlog at any date is not an accurate measure of our future sales. We strive to maintain proper inventory levels to support our customers’ just-in-time order expectations.  Our backlog of orders, based on expected ship date, was $618.3 million at December 31, 2020 and $278.7 million at December 31, 2019.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSES
 We generally rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, license agreements and policies to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, and to maintain our competitive position.   Despite these measures, we may not always succeed in protecting our intellectual property or preventing misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.  Other companies may independently develop similar technologies or seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property rights.  We acquired or licensed or sublicensed to numerous intellectual property rights in connection with our acquisitions over the years.  We have registered several of our trademarks in the U.S. and other countries, and seek to strengthen our brand to distinguish our products in the marketplace.   We maintain a patent portfolio comprised of both U.S. and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries.   We expect to continue to file patent applications in the U.S. and abroad covering technologies and products considered to be important to our business.  We do not believe any individual patent, group of patents, or the expiration thereof would materially affect the operation of our business.   For 
  6 -


proprietary technology or related know-how that is not covered by our patent strategy, we seek to protect them as trade secrets through contracts and policies to maintain their secrecy and confidentiality. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may become party to disputes involving intellectual property rights.  When we become aware of companies infringing our intellectual property rights, we seek to enforce our rights through appropriate actions.  We may receive claims of infringement or inquiries regarding possible infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, demands seeking royalty payments or other remedies, or cease and desist letters.  Depending on the situations, we may defend our position, seek to negotiate a license or engage in other acceptable resolution that is appropriate to our business. 
 We provide limited intellectual property indemnification for certain customers and may experience financial exposure related to intellectual property indemnity claims.  In certain situations, there are limits on our potential indemnification liability; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of potential payments, if any.  Although to date we have not paid any significant amounts for intellectual property indemnity claims, there can be no assurance that we will not face significant exposure in the future.
 From time to time, we may license our intellectual property rights in connection with the development or sale of our products.  We may license certain product technology from other companies, but we do not consider any particular licensed technology to be material to our operations or royalties paid by us to be material. We believe the duration and other terms of the licenses are appropriate for our current needs. See “Risk Factors – We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense, reduction in our intellectual property rights and a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Our foreign operations expose us to unique intellectual property technology risks compared to a company with fewer or no international operations.  For example, we are exposed to potential cyber security breaches that may target our employees or infrastructure outside the United States.  See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our International Operations” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a more detailed summary of the intellectual property technology risks associated with our international business operations.
 This Annual Report may include trade names and trademarks of other companies. Our use or display of other parties’ trade names, trademarks or products is not intended to, and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, the trade names or trademark owners. All trademarks appearing in this Annual Report not owned by us are the property of their holders.
 COMPETITION 
 Numerous semiconductor manufacturers and distributors serve the discrete, logic and analog semiconductor components market, making competition intense. Some of our larger competitors include Infineon Technologies A.G., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Texas Instruments, and Nexperia, formerly the Standard Products business of NXP Semiconductors N.V., many of which have greater financial, marketing, distribution, brand name recognition, research and development, manufacturing and other resources than we do. Accordingly, we, from time to time, may reposition product lines or decrease prices, which may affect our sales of, and profit margins on, such product lines. The price, features, availability and quality of our products, and our ability to design products and deliver customer service in keeping with our customers’ needs, determine the competitiveness of our products. We believe that our product focus, packaging expertise and our flexibility and ability to quickly adapt to customer needs affords us competitive advantages. See “Risk Factors – The semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.

 Our engineering and research and development groups consist of applications, circuit design, and product development engineers who assist in determining the direction of our future product lines. One of their key functions is to work closely with market-leading customers to further refine, expand and improve our product portfolio within our target product types and packages. In addition, customer requirements and acceptance of new package types are assessed and new, higher-density and more energy-efficient packages are developed to satisfy customers’ needs. 
 Product development engineers work directly with our semiconductor circuit design and layout engineers to develop and design products that match our customers’ requirements. We have the capability to capture the customers’ electrical and packaging requirements and translate those requirements into product specifications which can then be designed and manufactured to support customers’ end-system applications. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 As an international semiconductor company with a global footprint, Diodes recognizes the important role its human capital plays in a talent-based economy, and what the impact of effective and efficient human capital management has on its long-term strategic success and sustainable growth. Our employees are our most critical asset—they contribute to our financial success for the benefit of all our stakeholders, they are the source of great idea generation that fuels the engine of product innovation, and they are collaborators

and contributors to the success of the communities in which we live and work. Human capital management affects many aspects of our operations, including recruitment and talent acquisition, retention, training, workforce optimization, performance management, workplace safety, employee health and wellness, employee engagement, and diversity and inclusion. 
 Employee Communication - Developing two–way communications and deploying effective feedback mechanisms are critical components in our employee engagement process. We have an open door policy, and encourage employees to have regular conversations with their managers to share feedback and express concerns. We also solicit employee feedback informally through regular employee interactions. We hold our managers accountable for setting clear expectations and goals with their teams, for providing coaching, as well as identifying professional development opportunities for their teams, and for engaging in periodic performance reviews. We assist our managers with performance management tools as needed to help them effectively manage their teams and optimize workforce productivity. 
 Employee Retention, Training and Coaching - Employee retention is a critical element in our sustainable success. To maintain a stable workforce, we provide skill advancement training and coaching, where appropriate, to help our employees enhance their existing skillsets. With our support and preparation, our employees can continue to grow in their current role and maximize the value they contribute to their current teams. Where a suitable rotation opportunity arises, we provide skill expansion training to equip employees for these new positions. By honing their skills, our employees can leverage their institutional knowledge and experience to contribute to the overall success of the organization. The availability of rotational opportunities can also help keep our employees motivated and engaged. 
 Employee Safety - As an employer with a global workforce, we seek to provide safe working conditions and encourage our employees to engage in safe behaviors while completing their assigned job duties. We have programs to enhance the occupational health and safety of our employees and to promote employee wellness. These initiatives are designed yield positive business outcomes, such as less absenteeism, more motivated and engaged workforce, higher productivity, more consistent quality performance, and a better corporate image in our local communities—which in turn should help us attract talent and maintain a stable workforce. 
 Employee Demographics - We regularly review our workforce demographics and organizational structure to ensure that we have an efficient organization positioned to deliver cost-effective, high quality products to our customers and to serve the markets in which we operate. Diversity and inclusion considerations are embodied in many aspects of our operations, including pipeline opportunities.
  As of December 31, 2020, we employed 8,939 employees (including approximately 633 temporary labor or independent contractors). 7,915 of our employees were in Asia, 224 were in the U.S. and 800 were in Europe. The increase in our employee numbers during calendar year 2020 reflects, among other factors, the LSC acquisition in November 2020.  None of our employees in Asia or the U.S. are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and in Europe all our employees are covered by individual employment agreements with some collective bargaining agreements in place. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. See “Risk Factors – We may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing, finance and management/executive personnel required to operate our business successfully, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process in China and the U.K. where our wafer fabrication facilities are located, and in China, Taiwan and Germany where our assembly and test facilities are located. Any of these regulations could require us to acquire equipment or to incur substantial other costs to comply with environmental regulations or remediate problems. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our capital expenditures for environmental controls have not been material. See “Risk Factors – We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant expenses and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
