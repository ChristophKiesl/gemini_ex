ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated on March 4, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Since September 15, 2015, we have operated through a wholly-owned subsidiary RM Fresh Brands Inc. (“RM Fresh”), who services food and beverage retailers and distributors who are looking for innovative, trend-setting products across North America and in international markets. With a focus on sustainable, category changing consumables, RM Fresh acquired the rights to distribute an extensive portfolio of highly desirable brands, including Boxed Water, Cleansify, Uncle Si’s Iced Tea, Chef 5-Minute Meals, Gurkha Cigars, Shimla Foods, Aloe Gloe and Arriba Horchata. Through a network of sub-distribution partners across Canada, RM Fresh provides national product distribution and brokerage services. RM Fresh has an emerging focus on the United States and Middle East through the establishment of sub-distribution partners.
 
On August 31, 2016, in order to fund the ongoing operation and further development of RM, we consented to new third party investments into RM in the approximate total amount of $175,000, made in the form of cash and retirement of indebtedness owed by RM. As result of these new investments into RM, our ownership percentage of the company has been reduced to twenty percent (20%). In addition, we entered into a new Shareholder Agreement with RM, under which our shares in RM are subject to certain restrictions on transfer until such time as we declare a shareholder dividend of our RM shares following a going public transaction by RM, or in the alternative, for one (1) year after RM completes a going public transaction. Further, we disposed of an inter-company liability owed to us by RM in the amount of CDN$166,961.70. The liability was documented under a Demand Promissory Note issued to us by RM. We then assigned the note to an investor in RM in exchange for $3,000. Finally, we entered into a mutual Release agreement with RM. Under the Release, we released and discharged all liabilities owed to us by RM (with the exception of the Demand Promissory Note). RM in turn released us of all liabilities owing to RM and released us all ongoing contractual and financial responsibilities to RM, including our contractual obligation to further fund management fees or other expenses to be incurred by RM.
 
On June 28, 2017, Randall Letcavage entered into a stock purchase agreement for the acquisition of an aggregate of 286,720 shares of Common Stock of the Company, representing approximately 91% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company as of such date, from Rehan Saeed, the previous majority shareholder of the Company (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreements were fully executed and delivered, and the transaction consummated as of and at July 7, 2017. Consequently, Mr. Letcavage is now able to unilaterally control the election of our board of directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of our Company.
 
In addition, on June 28, 2017, Rehan Saeed submitted his resignation from all executive officer positions with the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and President, effective on the 10th day following the filing of a Schedule 14f-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On June 28, 2017, Randall Letcavage was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director, effective immediately.

Also on June 28, 2017, the board of directors of the Company acknowledged the $20,000 of third party (unaffiliated) debt held by two lenders which is and has been included in the Company’s filed and audited financial statements, and extended the repayment terms of the previously demand debt obtained the waiver of potential fees and penalties and granted conversion rights. As a result, the Company issued convertible promissory notes to the holders in the aggregate principal amount of $20,000 which in the aggregate allow the debt to be converted into a maximum of 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company following any business combination in which more than 51% of our shares are issued (the notes originally converted at $0.75 per share, and such conversion rate has adjusted based on later issuances and business combinations). The notes are assignable at the option of the holders. We understand that prior to the September 11, 2017, those notes were been assigned to five entities who each may convert the note held into 4.99% of our outstanding common stock on the date of conversion. In connection with the transactions described herein, debt held by Rehan Saeed was cancelled and waived.
