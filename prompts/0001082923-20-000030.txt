Our multi-carrier solutions also provide our customers with access to discounted carrier rates including USPS and UPS®. 
Consolidation Services
As part of our mailing and shipping business, we offer domestic and international shipping services through our consolidator partners, who group packages by destination and ship the packages directly or through partners. These services seek to take advantage of economies of scale, with the goal of yielding lower shipping costs for our customers.
Back-End Integrations
As part of our mailing and shipping services, we offer our back-end integration solutions where we provide the electronic postage for transactions to partners who manage the front-end users. Our solutions integrate directly into the most popular e-commerce platforms, allowing web store managers to completely automate their order fulfillment process by processing, managing and shipping orders from virtually any e-commerce source through a single interface without manual data entry. Managers can retrieve order data and print complete shipping labels for all types of packages.
We have integration partnerships with the USPS where we provide electronic postage for mailing and shipping transactions generated by certain USPS-branded programs. For example, we provide the electronic postage for Click-N-Ship®, a web-based service available at USPS.com that allows USPS customers to purchase and print shipping labels for certain domestic and international mail classes or packages at no additional mark-up over the cost of postage. 
Mailing & Shipping Supplies
As part of our mailing and shipping services, we offer mailing and shipping-focused office supplies to our customers through our online supplies stores. Our supplies stores are available within our mailing and shipping solutions and sell a variety of products including NetStamps labels, shipping labels, mailing labels, postage printers and scales. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Branded Insurance
As part of our mailing and shipping services, we offer branded insurance for packages to our customers so that they may insure their mail or packages in a fully integrated, online process that eliminates any trips to retail carrier locations or the need to complete any special forms. Our branded insurance is offered by certain brands including Stamps.com, Endicia, ShippingEasy, ShipStation, and ShipWorks as part of their solutions. Our branded insurance is provided by our insurance providers.
Customized Postage
We offer customized postage under the PhotoStamps® brand name. Customized postage is a patented form of USPS postage that allows consumers to turn digital photos, designs or images into valid USPS-approved postage. With this product, individuals or businesses can create customized USPS-approved postage using pictures of their children, pets, vacations, celebrations, business logos and more. Customized postage can be used as regular postage to send letters, postcards or packages. PhotoStamps is available from our www.photostamps.com website.
Revenue Model
Customers may pay us a monthly fee, based on a subscription plan which may be waived or refunded for certain customers, for which we provide them access to our platform. We have been, and in the future potentially could be, compensated directly by our carriers for shipping labels printed that meet certain requirements. We may earn revenue from customers when they purchase postage, print shipping labels or perform other transactions using our solutions. We may earn revenue that may take the form of some or all of the spread between the rate a customer pays and the rate the carrier or integration partner receives, either charged directly or paid by our partners. We may earn other types of revenue shares or other compensation from specific customers that have access to our platform or through integration partners.
Target Customers
We target different customer segments through our various brands and service plans within those brands. We target smaller offices, home offices, larger enterprises, e-commerce merchants and higher volume shippers including warehouses, fulfillment houses and omni-channel retailers. 
Our smaller office and home office customers are primarily mailers but also send some packages. These customers generally need a relatively basic set of mailing and shipping features and primarily use a version of our Stamps.com branded product.
Our larger enterprise customers are primarily mailers but also send some packages. These customers generally have multiple geographic locations and need a richer set of mailing capabilities such as multiple-user functionality, automated USPS mail forms, additional reference codes, enhanced reporting and controls. These customers primarily use a version of our Stamps.com branded product.
Our e-commerce merchant customers are primarily shippers who range in size from individuals to medium size businesses, sell through multiple channels and who ship in medium to higher volumes. These customers generally need a relatively robust set of shipping features including integrations with shopping carts, marketplaces and e-commerce tools; advanced order management features including inventory management, combined and split orders, order filters and alerts; sophisticated automation features such as custom hierarchical rules, batch processing, packing slips, customs forms and emails; robust product management features including product catalog support and product categorization support; and various other features including customer marketing, end-to-end package tracking, rate comparisons, returns labels and many more. These customers also generally need access to multiple carriers and discounted carrier rates. These customers primarily use versions of our Stamps.com, Endicia, ShippingEasy and ShipStation branded products.
Our higher volume shipping customers include warehouses, fulfillment houses and omni-channel retailers, and similar to our e-commerce merchant customers, generally need a relatively robust set of shipping features and need access to multiple carriers and discounted carrier rates. These customers primarily use versions of our ShipEngine, ShipStation, ShipWorks and MetaPack branded products.

2020 Business Strategy
Our 2020 business strategy includes the initiatives and plans listed below. These initiatives and plans are subject to change without notice based on our analysis of market and business conditions, and constitute “forward-looking statements,” and accordingly are subject to the cautionary statements, qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements we discuss at the beginning of Part I of this Report.
Mailing and Shipping Business
We plan to continue to execute our strategy to transform our business into a global multi-carrier and e-commerce solutions company in 2020. We will continue to pursue diversified carrier relationships, such as our partnership with UPS, while continuing to work closely with the USPS. This strategy also includes leveraging our portfolio of mailing and shipping solutions to drive growth. With the acquisitions of Endicia, MetaPack, ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks, we now have a full and diverse suite of solutions across these brands, and we believe that we have a complete product and robust solution that will meet the needs of our current and of our target domestic and international customers. 
We plan to continue to invest in the shipping part of our business where our customers include e-commerce merchants, warehouses, fulfillment houses, large retailers and other types of shippers. In particular, we plan to continue to expand the features and functionality of our solutions that will improve the value propositions of our solutions for shippers, add new partnerships and integrations, and offer enhanced support. We also plan to continue offering services such as our consolidation services program, which bundles international shipping with valuable customer benefits such as free package pickup, free insurance, upgraded delivery speeds, enhanced tracking, simpler customs procedures and other benefits.
We plan to increase our total sales and marketing expense in 2020 based on expected strong return on our investment from our mailing and shipping customers due to their high expected lifetime value relative to the expected cost of acquiring those customers.
Further, we plan to increase, optimize and refine our enterprise mailing customer lead generation and sales and marketing efforts. Our solutions targeted at enterprise customers continue to have a stronger customer value proposition compared to postage meters and our customers continue to be attracted to our enterprise solution versus a postage meter.
Customized Postage Business
In 2020, we plan to continue marketing customized postage, but with limited spending and expectations. In recent years, we reduced our consumer-focused marketing spending in order to lower our customer acquisition costs and improve our expected returns and profitability in the customized postage business. We plan to continue this strategy, which includes maintaining efforts to generate high volume business orders which have become a larger part of our customized postage business in recent years.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Competition
We compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access mailing and shipping carrier services, including retail mailing and shipping locations, carrier specific electronic solutions, multi-carrier and e-commerce solutions and traditional postage meters.
Retail Mailing and Shipping Locations
We compete with a variety of retail based mailing and shipping offerings from the USPS and private carriers including UPS and FedEx. The USPS’s offerings include retail post offices, self-service kiosks, contract post offices, community post offices and village post offices. The USPS also authorizes third parties to offer USPS products and services such as Hallmark stores, grocery stores, membership warehouse clubs and office supplies stores. Private carrier retail based offerings include retail stores including UPS stores and FedEx Office stores, and authorized third party offerings including grocery stores, membership warehouse clubs and office supplies stores.
We believe customers choose our products over retail based mailing and shipping options because of the convenience of our solutions, the breadth of features we offer, the quality of our support organization and ability to mail or ship from their home or business without making a trip to retail locations. We believe customers choose retail locations over our solutions because of the additional fees that we typically charge, the convenience of utilizing a retail location and/or the unavailability of certain carrier products through our solutions.
Carrier Specific Electronic Solutions
We compete with a variety of carrier specific electronic solutions offered in a variety of formats, including direct UI based solutions, direct API based solutions, and manifesting solutions. Direct UI based solutions of the USPS include USPS.com and USPS Click-N-Ship. The USPS also competes indirectly through authorized PC Postage vendors including Pitney Bowes with their pbSmartPostage and SendPro products. Direct UI based solutions of private carriers include ups.com®, UPS WorldShip®, FedEx.com and FedEx Ship Manager. 
Direct API based solutions of the USPS include USPS Web Tools and Click-N-Ship Business Pro which utilize the USPS’s electronic verification system (eVS) or ePostage systems for providing access to USPS without needing a PC Postage certification or partnering with a USPS approved PC Postage vendor. Indirect API based solutions for the USPS include Shippo’s and those of authorized PC Postage vendors including Pitney Bowes and EasyPost. Direct API based solutions are also offered by private carriers including UPS and FedEx.
Manifesting solutions are offered directly by carriers including USPS, UPS and FedEx.
We believe customers choose our solutions over the various carrier specific solutions because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the superiority of our UIs, the breadth of features that we offer and the quality of our support organization. We believe customers choose various carrier-specific solutions over our solutions because of the additional fees that we may charge, free implementation, hardware or supplies that may be offered and/or the convenience of using one of these other products based on the specific needs of their business.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Multi-Carrier and Other E-Commerce Solutions
We compete with a variety of multi-carrier and other e-commerce solutions. Our market-leading UI and API based multi-carrier offerings compete against other multi-carrier offerings including EasyShip, GlobalShip, ProShip, Shippo and others. Our multi-carrier offerings also compete with alternative e-commerce solutions including those available through online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay; e-commerce platforms such as Shopify; warehouse and transportation management systems such as Logistyx and BluJay; and other competitors who offer package manifesting, inventory management and/or listing management solutions individually or together as part of a more comprehensive solution. In Europe, MetaPack primarily competes with transportation and delivery management providers such as Centiro and Sorted.
We believe customers choose our multi-carrier e-commerce products over alternative solutions because of the superiority of our UIs and APIs, our extensive partner integrations, the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features we offer, the value of our product and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose other multi-carrier e-commerce solutions over our solutions because of the higher fees that we may charge, the convenience of utilizing an integrated multi-carrier shipping solution as part of an overall e-commerce product and the breadth and depth of features available in a larger enterprise level solution.
Traditional Postage Meters
We compete with small business oriented traditional postage meters including those offered by FP Mailing Solutions, Hasler, Neopost and Pitney Bowes in the U.S. market. We generally do not compete with higher volume postage meters generally found in dedicated mail rooms which can process mail faster than the speed of an office printer and which may also offer various automation services such as folding, inserting, sealing and weighing.
We believe that customers choose our solutions over small business oriented traditional postage meters because of our lower total cost of ownership and/or the greater visibility and financial controls we provide which are not readily available with postage meters. We believe customers choose traditional postage meters over our solutions because of the ease of use, speed, and/or convenience of those products.
Market Overview
As previously mentioned, we target different customer segments through our various brands and service plans within those brands. Trends in market data do not necessarily correspond to trends in our business. However, we believe the following information is relevant context in assessing our principal markets of the U.S. and Europe. 
Customers 
According to the most recent available statistics provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Businesses, and the Internal Revenue Service, respectively, there were approximately 6 million small businesses with 1 - 99 employees as of 2016 and approximately 26 million sole proprietorships in 2017. Our mailing and shipping solutions target the home office, home business, small office and small business customers. We believe that some portion of the small businesses and sole proprietorships in the United States are potential customers for our solutions. 
According to the most recent available statistics provided by Eurostat, it's estimated there were approximately 24.3 million enterprises in the non-financial business economy in the EU-28 in 2017, of which approximately 99% had fewer than 250 employees. We believe that some portion of these small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe are potential customers for our international solutions. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Carriers 
According to the USPS Fiscal 2019 Final Revenue, Pieces, and Weight by Classes of Mail and Special Services Report, the total USPS revenue was $71.3 billion during its fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. Of this amount, approximately $38.3 billion was represented by mail classes that are supported using our current solutions (First Class Mail, First Class Packages, International Mail, Media Mail, Parcel Select, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, and special services including Certified Mail, Return Receipt, USPS tracking and package insurance). The $38.3 billion in supported mail classes is comprised of (1) $11.3 billion in First Class mail; (2) $22.0 billion in shipping and package services; (3) $1.4 billion in international mail; (4) $0.9 billion in special services; and (5) $2.7 billion in ancillary and other mail services. We believe that some portion of the $38.3 billion in supported mail classes was generated by users who are potential customers for our solutions.
According to data derived from the UPS 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, UPS earned $46.5 billion of U.S. Domestic Package segment revenue on 4.7 billion packages shipped and $14.2 billion of International Package segment revenue on 807.8 million packages shipped. According to data derived from the FedEx 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the FedEx Q2 Fiscal 2020 Statistics Report, FedEx earned $13.7 billion of U.S. FedEx Express segment package revenue on 739.8 million packages shipped, $15.4 billion on International FedEx Express segment package revenue on 842.0 million packages shipped, and $20.5 billion on FedEx Ground segment revenue on 2.3 billion packages shipped. When taken together, we estimate that the top 3 U.S. carriers (UPS, FedEx and the USPS) have domestic and international package revenue of approximately $132.3 billion. And according to data derived from the 2018 Annual Report of Deutsche Post DHL Group (the largest global express carrier in Europe by market volume), we estimate there is approximately $2.4 billion represented by DHL Express International shipments originating in the U.S. and $11.0 billion originating outside the U.S. We believe some portion of the approximately $145.7 billion package revenue was generated by users who are potential customers for our solutions.
 E-Commerce Trends
We believe that underlying e-commerce trends are a factor in the trends affecting our customers and our business. According to quarterly U.S. Census Bureau Retail E-Commerce Sales reports, U.S. e-commerce sales for 2019 were estimated at $601 billion, an increase of 15.4% over e-commerce sales in 2018. E-commerce sales accounted for 11.0% of total U.S. retail sales in 2019 which was up from 9.9% of total retail sales in 2018. 
According to the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics, 2018 e-commerce sales by businesses in the UK non-financial sector reached £688 billion, growing 18% over 2017 sales estimated at £582 billion. This trend is seen across Europe, as Eurostat estimates the volume of European Union retail sales via either mail order houses or the Internet increased 11% in 2019 over 2018 (inclusive of UK sales).
The PC Postage Certification and Regulatory Approval Process
Our technology must meet strict U.S. government security standards. Our PC Postage products complete extensive USPS testing and evaluation in the areas of operational reliability, financial integrity and security to become certified for commercial distribution. The USPS certification process to become an USPS-approved PC Postage vendor is a standardized extensive process. The process includes testing and reviews by the USPS and an independent test laboratory, and certification of meeting Federal Information Processing Standards. While the USPS has no published timeline or estimated time to complete the process, it took the existing approved vendors years to complete. Stamps.com was approved in 1999 and Endicia was approved in 2000.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our Technology
Our systems are located in a combination of secure connected cloud infrastructure platforms and multiple geographically disparate high-security data centers. These systems create and process the data used to generate information-based indicia and third party carrier certified labels. Our proprietary technology processes postage purchases using secure technology that meets USPS and federal security requirements. Our services currently include Windows and Mac based clients, web-based applications and API Integrations that support a variety of shipping label and envelope options along with a wide range of printers. In addition, our applications employ an internally developed user authentication mechanism for additional security.
Our transaction processing servers are a combination of secure, commercially available and internally developed technologies that are designed to provide secure and reliable transactions. Our implementation of security system hardware meets government standards for security and data integrity. The database servers are designed and built with industry-leading database technologies for high availability and throughput. The performance and scalability of our PC Postage and carrier label systems are designed to allow many users to simultaneously process shipping transactions with a variety of carriers in real-time.
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, trade name and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our rights in our products, services, know-how and information. We have a portfolio of issued and pending U.S. and international patents. We also have a number of trade names and registered and unregistered trademarks. We plan to apply for more patents, trade names and trademarks in the future. Our issued in force and pending patents have a range of expiration dates from 2020 until 2037. 
We continually invest in development of new technologies, products and services and enhancements to existing features and functionality. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Research and Development” for the amount spent during each of the last three fiscal years on Company-sponsored research and development activities.
Revenue Information and Seasonality
During 2019, 2018, and 2017, we did not recognize revenue from any one customer that represented 10% or more of our total revenues.
See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,” for the percentage of total revenue contributed by categories of similar products or services that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Our product and insurance revenues are subject to seasonal variations with the first and fourth calendar quarters being typically seasonally stronger and the second and third calendar quarters being typically seasonally slower. Our service revenue is subject to seasonal variation driven by our growth in packages shipped where the fourth calendar quarter is typically seasonally stronger due to the holiday shipping season and to a lesser extent, by customer acquisition which is typically seasonally stronger in the first and fourth calendar quarters and typically seasonally slower in the second and third calendar quarters. Our customized postage revenue is typically seasonally stronger in the fourth calendar quarter due to the holidays but can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on high volume business orders.
