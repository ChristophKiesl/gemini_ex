ITEM 1. Business 
OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY 
At Vonage, our vision is to accelerate the world's ability to connect. We are observing a secular change in the way business is done, with a fundamental shift in how communications technologies are being leveraged in almost every industry. Through the Vonage Communications Platform, our strategy is to deliver a single leading cloud communications platform that powers our customers' and partners' global engagement solutions using our APIs, Unified Communications, and Contact Center innovations. We believe that the Vonage Communications Platform's products and services are well positioned to take advantage of emerging trends with sizable, growing total addressable markets as companies look to cloud-based communications solutions and API programming architectures as part of their digital transformation.
For our Consumer customers, we enable users to access and utilize our services and features, via their existing internet connections, including over 3G/4G, LTE, Cable, or DSL broadband networks. This technology enables us to offer our Consumer customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices. Our Consumer strategy is focused on the continued penetration of our core North American markets, which provide value in international long distance and target under-served segments. 
EVOLUTION OF VONAGE
Founded in 2001, Vonage was among the first companies to provide Voice over Internet Protocol technology offering feature-rich, low-cost home phone services. Through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, Vonage since has transformed from a VoIP-based residential service provider to a global leader in business cloud communications. 
Beginning in November 2013 and continuing through September 2015, Vonage acquired four unified communications-as-a-service companies which began its transformation into a buisness-to-business cloud communications company. In 2016 and 2018, Vonage expanded its offering into the API space with the completion of the acquisition of Nexmo, Inc., a global leader in communications platform as a service and TokBox Inc., an industry leader in WebRTC programmable video that enables developers and enterprises to integrate live video into existing websites, mobile apps and IoT devices with only a few lines of code. 
Also in 2018, Vonage completed the acquisition of NewVoiceMedia, an industry-leading cloud contact center-as-a-service provider. This acquisition enabled Vonage to combine its robust Unified Communications and API solutions with NVM's pure-play cloud contact center offerings, culminating in our ability to provide an end-to-end communication experience for an organization's team members and customers. 
In 2021, Vonage completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Jumper AI Ptd. Ltd., a leader in omnichannel conversational commerce solutions. The acquisition expanded Vonage's total addressable market and complemented its robust portfolio of APIs with a packaged AI-enabled conversational commerce offering.
On November 22, 2021, the Company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) ("Ericsson") and Ericsson Muon Holding Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") providing for the acquisition of the Company by Ericsson for approximately $6.2 billion in cash. The proposed transaction received the required approval of the Company's stockholders on February 9, 2022 and is expected to be consummated during the first half of 2022 following the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.

The Vonage Communications Platform includes our APIs, Unified Communications, Contact Center service offerings and products. The Vonage Communications Platform represents the Company’s strategic business as the source of future growth. Our Consumer segment includes our communications solutions for residential customers based on the Company's roots in providing VoIP communication services. Additional discussions of our reportable segments is included in Note 16, Industry Segment and Geographical Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables summarize our revenues for each of our operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:
Vonage Communications Platform
Our strategic business is the Vonage Communications Platform, which delivers a single leading cloud communications platform that powers our customers' and partners' global engagement solutions using our APIs, Unified Communications, and Contact Center innovations. The Vonage Communications Platform brings unique value to businesses by providing multiple communications channels - including video, voice, messaging, email, verification, and artificial intelligence - that integrate into the applications, products and workflows that our customers are already using. We believe this delivers both the power and the flexibility to our customers to address the growing need to transform their communications, connections and experiences for customers and enables the type of business continuity, remote work, and remote delivery of services that are now essential for team members. 
The following provides a more detailed description of the products and services within the Vonage Communications Platform:
APIs
Our APIs are fully programmable, embeddable and customizable, enabling software developers to build communications capabilities such as messaging and voice calling within their applications without having to build or maintain communications infrastructure.
Our APIs aim to remove the complexities of the global communications networks and deliver video, voice, chat, messaging, verification, and artificial intelligence capabilities that developers can easily embed into their applications with a low risk, pay-as-you-go business model that fosters innovation. Developers adopt our APIs via a low friction, self service model on our website where they start with a free trial account and pay for additional usage via prepaid accounts. Customers include digital native companies that are looking to disrupt an existing industry, enterprises undergoing digital transformation, and enterprise SaaS companies looking to enhance their products with embedded communications capabilities. 
The need for companies to jump between these modes of communication is being driven by today's customer. There is an increased need among businesses to provide their customers with the ability to connect and communicate on their customers' own preferred channels. In an increasingly digital world, this is what customers have come to expect. Our APIs enable businesses to implement these programmable capabilities quickly, with just a few lines of code, and without the need for in-house IT support or expertise.

Consumer 
For our Consumer segment, we enable customers to access and utilize our services and features via their existing internet connections, including over 3G/4G, LTE, Cable, or DSL broadband networks. This technology enables us to offer our Consumer customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices. Our home telephone services are offered to customers through several service plans with different pricing structures. The service plans include basic features such as voicemail, call waiting, and call forwarding as well as unique features such as Simulring, Visual Voicemail, Boomerang and Extensions. We also charge for local and international calling outside of plan limits. 

We have two primary Consumer offerings available in the United States: Vonage World and Vonage North America. Each of our Consumer calling plans provides a number of basic features including call waiting, caller ID with name, call forwarding, and voicemail. Vonage plans also include unlimited Vonage Visual Voicemail, which is “readable voicemail” delivered via email or SMS text message, Vonage Extensions, which extends the plan, and inbound calling, to additional phone numbers and devices, and selective call block, which allows users to block unwanted calls. We also offer, in some cases for additional fees, features such as area code selection, virtual phone numbers, and web-enabled voicemail. Additionally, we also provides similar product offerings to customers in both Canada and the United Kingdom.
NETWORK OPERATIONS 
Our network uses our customer’s existing or Vonage procured high-speed broadband Internet service to allow calls over the Internet either from a standard telephone through a Vonage-enabled device or through soft phone software or mobile client applications. Our Unified Communications services are not dependent on any specific type or provider of Internet service, and our customers are free to change their Internet service provider in response to a competitive alternative, or because they have moved to a different location. For many of our Business Enterprise customers, our Unified Communications services are delivered over the Company's private, nationwide, fault tolerant, secure IP MPLS network under multi-year contracts to provide the high level of interconnection quality and the ability to offer service level agreements, or SLA, guaranteeing certain levels of voice service performance.
Our network is scalable and geographically distributed for robustness, high availability, and reliability across multiple call processing sites, using regional data interconnection points, where calls to non-Vonage customers are interconnected with the public switched telephone network. We periodically assess the locations of its regional data connection points in connection with efforts to improve the quality of and efficiency in delivering our service. Our interconnections with the public switched telephone network, or IP/SIP networks, are made pursuant to commercial agreements we have with several telecommunications providers. Under these agreements, we transfer calls originated by customers to other carriers who connect the call to the called party or connect peer to peer. We have a varying degree of settlement arrangements with our carrier partners for indirect third party or direct termination of calls. The calls are routed from our network to other carriers’ interconnected circuits at co-location facilities in which the Company leases space. This method of connecting to the public switched telephone or IP/SIP networks allows us to expand capacity quickly, as necessary to meet call volume, and to provide redundancy within the network. 
Because Vonage’s system is standards based and not constrained to use any specific broadband service provider to connect to our customers, we can centrally manage and share resources across our customer base to minimize capital investment when entering new markets.
MARKETING 
In connection with our transformation from a consumer telecommunications company to a business-focused SaaS provider, beginning in 2020 we introduced a rebranding of the Company and began a focused pivot to drive relevancy in our key business markets. Our marketing objective is to help drive growth, revenue, and relevancy across our business markets. Vonage employs an integrated multi-channel approach to marketing, whereby we evaluate and focus efforts on efficient marketing vehicles to accomplish its goals with the greatest return on investment. To do this, we make use of both broad-reaching and highly-targeted media channels. 
For VCP customers, our primary source of lead acquisition is digital marketing in the form of search engine marketing, digital advertising, social media advertising, and affiliate programs. We also utilize database marketing and lead aggregators to source business leads and use direct marketing and account-based marketing to help source leads and create interest in our solutions. For Consumer customers, we have a highly optimized acquisition approach and focus mainly on digital advertising channels.
7     VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021




We make use of marketing research to gain insights into brand, product, and service performance, and utilize those learnings to improve our messaging and media plans. Market research is also leveraged in the areas of testing, retention marketing, and product marketing to ensure we bring compelling products and services to market for our customers.
The Vonage brand is a meaningful factor for customers as they consider business services. We continue to invest in the equity of our brand in order to retain and expand our customer base and to position Vonage as a technology leader that delivers innovative, unified communication services and APIs to help businesses around the world accelerate digital transformation for a fundamentally new way of doing business. 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

We utilize our team of sales agents (or field sales team), primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects to market and sell our business services.

This allows customers to self-provision their accounts with the aim of improving the customer experience while reducing customer acquisition costs.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Vonage currently owns over 250 issued U.S. patents as well as a number of foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. The Company routinely reviews technological developments with technology staff and business units to identify the aspects of Vonage technology that provide us with a technological or commercial advantage and seek intellectual property and patent protection as appropriate to protect such key proprietary technology in the United States and internationally, based on our assessment in light of applicable law. The Company's policies require our employees to assign intellectual property rights developed in the scope of or in relation to, company business and to treat proprietary know-how and materials as confidential information.
8     VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2021




Vonage has acquired multiple U.S. and foreign patents, and obtained licenses to numerous other patents. The Company owns numerous United States and international trademarks and service marks and have applied for registration of trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad to establish and protect brand names as part of intellectual property strategy. 
COMPETITION 
In connection with its cloud communications products, Vonage faces competition from the traditional telephone and cable companies as discussed below, as well as from vendors of premises-based solutions or hosted solutions including the following:
•Independent cloud service providers;
•Premises-based business communication equipment providers;
•Hosted communication services providers;
•Traditional technology companies; and
•Emerging competitors in technology companies.
As the cloud communications market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies accelerates, Vonage may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumers rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include cloud communications.
Vonage faces strong competition from traditional telephone companies, cable companies, wireless companies, alternative communication providers, direct unified communications providers, legacy consumer VOIP businesses, large technology incumbents, and collaboration providers in the consumer, mobile, SMB and enterprise markets. Because most of the Company's target customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers, success is dependent upon our ability to attract these customers away from their existing providers. The principal competitive factors affecting our ability to attract and retain customers are price, call quality, brand awareness, customer service, network and system reliability, service features and capabilities, scalability, usability, simplicity, mobile integration and the unique ability to deliver APIs to business customers in addition to our Unified Communications and Contact Center Communications offerings.
There is a continuing trend toward consolidation of competitive companies, including the acquisition of alternative communication providers by Internet product and software companies with significant resources. In addition, certain of our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services, leveraging their collective competitive positions. Vonage is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies, which could give rise to significant new competition.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. At Vonage, we believe our culture is our human capital competitive advantage that empowers us to win in the marketplace. We believe the substantial skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our employees. These beliefs are built on a core set of values: accountability, collaboration, trust, and excellence. Vonage leaders strive to foster an environment that empowers team members to drive results, delight customers, and inspire teams.
There are several ways in which we attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent, including:
•Strategic Approach to Work-Life Balance, Diversity, and Inclusion. As part of our strategic plan, we have implemented flexible remote working and parental leave for all employees, have mandatory unconscious bias and culture training for all employees, implement company-sponsored networking events for female employees, and have milestones in place to achieve gender pay parity. Objectives and key results for our senior executives also include metrics on diversity, pay equity, voluntary terminations, and internal mobility. We have also established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee that is focused on promoting race, gender, and ethnic diversity throughout the organization.
•Investments in Employee Training and Development. In order to foster internal promotion and development, we continue to implement accelerated leadership development and emerging leadership programs to a diverse set of employees throughout the organization. We also continue to implement development and training programs for all employees including product and sales, Code of Conduct, conflicts of interest, information security and cybersecurity, anti-harassment and anti-bribery, and insider trading prohibitions.
