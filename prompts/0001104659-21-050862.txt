Item 1.Business
Corporate History and Background
We were incorporated on October 22, 2018 as RMG Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
On October 5, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), with RMG Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and Romeo Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Romeo”). On December 29, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the business combination with Legacy Romeo was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Romeo, with Legacy Romeo surviving as the surviving company and as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name to Romeo Power, Inc.
Overview
We are an industry leading energy storage technology company focused on designing and manufacturing lithium-ion battery modules and packs for commercial electric vehicles. Through our energy dense battery modules and packs, we enable large-scale sustainable transportation by delivering safe, longer lasting batteries that have shorter charge times and longer life. With greater energy density, we are able to create lightweight and efficient solutions that deliver superior performance and provide improved acceleration, range and durability compared to battery packs provided by our competitors. Our modules and packs are customizable and scalable and are optimized by our proprietary battery management system (“BMS”). We believe we produce superior battery products compared to our competitors by leveraging our technical expertise and depth of knowledge of energy storage systems.
At our 7 GWh-capable state-of-the-art 113,000-square-foot production facility in Los Angeles, California, we are able to innovate, develop and manufacture battery modules and packs in high volumes. We are battery cell agnostic so we can harness the best of current battery technologies, while being flexible enough to adopt next generation battery technologies when they are ready to meet our stringent standards and customer requirements. Our founders were former leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon, Apple, Bosch and Samsung, and our highly skilled team is experienced with multiple prolific vehicle launches and deep knowledge across all core engineering disciplines including electrical, thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrochemistry. With over 60 battery-specific engineers, we have researched, developed, and deployed energy dense and space-saving battery pack designs, proprietary thermal management, and a smart, built-in BMS to support a wide range of customers with products featuring next-level range, performance and durability.
Currently, we primarily focus on two key markets in mobility energy technology: North American Class 6-8 commercial trucks and buses, and European commercial and high-performance vehicles through the BorgWarner JV (as defined below), of which we own a 40% interest. We have also collaborated with Heritage Environmental Services, Inc. (“HES”), to focus on sustainability and reuse applications of our batteries, and we have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Ecellix Inc., to cooperate in the development, validation and launch of next-generation battery technology. These relationships help us to de-risk our business model, scale our business, and deliver value to our customers.

Since 2016, we have been designing and building battery modules, and we provide enabling battery technology to key customers in the automotive industry. We are not manufacturers of vehicles directly subject to regulatory requirements applicable to vehicles; rather, our role is supplying the vehicle manufacturers with the most appropriate battery modules and battery technology for their specific vehicle designs and intended uses. The advantage we bring to the vehicle manufacturers with whom we partner is the ability to design lighter batteries with higher energy density and output, as described further below. While our customers are subject to specific regulatory requirements for vehicle safety standards, such regulations do not directly apply to us; our products are designed to integrate into vehicles required to meet these standards. Our business is working with vehicle manufactures to provide them with the preeminent energy storage technology that works in their vehicles.
As the era of fossil fuel powered vehicles continues to decline, our mission is to lead the way towards electrification of the global transportation industry and be the commercial electric vehicle energy provider of today and tomorrow, driving change to move people and goods efficiently with zero emissions.
Industry & Market
Total Addressable Market
Our energy technology has positioned us to lead the electrification of the global commercial vehicles market. Globally, the total addressable market (“TAM”) for commercial vehicles (in all weight classes) and buses is estimated to be approximately $665 billion with over 17 million vehicles sold annually with steady growth expected to continue as global economic growth fuels the need for more commercial vehicles. In North America and Europe, the TAM for the same vehicles is estimated to be approximately $225 billion with over 7 million vehicles sold annually (IHS Markit Data, 2019).
Shift to Zero-Emission Vehicles
A variety of regulatory developments driven by consumer and societal pressures to reduce CO2 emissions are helping drive rapid adoption of zero-emission vehicles, thus accelerating the electrification of commercial vehicles. As a result, global electric vehicle sales are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19% from 2020-2040, while internal combustion engine (“ICE”), sales are projected to decrease by 5% over the same period (Morgan Stanley Research, 2020).

● | California’s Air Resources Board proposed the world’s first zero-emission sales mandate on commercial trucks, including 40% of trucks sold to be zero-emission by 2035 and 100% by 2045.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As of July 2020, 15 states in the United States have announced plans to make every new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sold within their borders fully electric by 2050.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The European Union Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/631, which introduced CO2 emission performance standards. Per this regulation, between 2025-2029, the fleet-wide average CO2 emissions must be 15% lower compared to 2019 levels and by 2030, they must be 30% lower compared to 2019 levels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logistics and OEM Commitments to EV
Similarly, the world’s largest logistics and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) have also committed to electric fleets, as electrification enables a reduction in total cost of ownership for logistics players:

Our modular battery design allows for mass production and easy application into an array of vehicles. Our batteries are designed around vehicle class requirements and, accordingly, are end-market agnostic.

Battery Management System
Our proprietary BMS is designed, tested and validated in-house. It offers a complete solution for monitoring and controlling complex battery systems for automotive applications, making it one of the most holistic systems in the market today. Our battery packs utilize a BMS that manages the modules and packs to ensure they operate at optimal performance while safely maintaining ideal operating conditions.
Our BMS can be customized to suit each customer’s specific application using our proprietary management algorithm to enable rapid charge or discharge of the battery while optimizing performance and longevity.
Our battery modules and packs are single-cell fault-tolerant. This means that in the outlying case, where for some reason a certain battery exhibits a thermal incident, the thermal incident will not propagate to the neighboring cells. Based on system requirements, our BMS can be programmed to shut off the system completely after a cell-related incident, or to keep operating safely in an actively derated fashion until servicing is conducted.
Non-recurring Engineering
We provide non-recurring engineering services to our customers as they look to implement a flexible solution across their entire fleets. Such services include design, prototype and testing services. We provide similar services to the BorgWarner JV for its customers.
Other Product Pipeline
Beyond the current battery modules, our R&D efforts continue to drive higher energy density, specific energy, continuous power, and safety. In addition to the current technology offered to the market, we have several products in development, which will demonstrate further advanced innovation in safety, reliability and energy density (both gravimetric and volumetric) characteristics.
Joint Venture with BorgWarner
In May 2019, Legacy Romeo joined forces with a subsidiary of Tier 1 automotive supplier BorgWarner to form a joint venture named BorgWarner Romeo Power LLC (the “BorgWarner JV”). Our strategic alliance with BorgWarner is intended to give us, through our ownership interest in the joint venture, an opportunity to benefit from BorgWarner’s manufacturing expertise, superior purchasing power with our existing suppliers, and longstanding relationships with many of our target customers. We believe this strategic alliance will potentially allow us, through the joint venture, to accelerate our reach into new markets, particularly in Europe and Asia, without the need to expend substantial capital developing 

11



new production facilities. Furthermore, we believe partnering with a highly regarded supplier can de-risk our production plan by leveraging BorgWarner’s global production resources through the BorgWarner JV to scale production operations worldwide while maintaining the highest levels of product quality.
The BorgWarner JV is owned 40% by Legacy Romeo and 60% by a subsidiary of BorgWarner, and the respective rights of Legacy Romeo and BorgWarner in respect of the BorgWarner JV are set forth in a Joint Venture Operating Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) and an Intellectual Property License Agreement (the “IP License”). Those agreements:

● | allocate rights to exploit Legacy Romeo’s current and future intellectual property rights (“Romeo IP”) between Legacy Romeo and the BorgWarner JV based on geography and vehicle type;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide a license to Legacy Romeo and BorgWarner of the BorgWarner JV’s intellectual property rights;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require the BorgWarner JV to pay Legacy Romeo a royalty for products sold by the BorgWarner JV, subject to Legacy Romeo satisfying minimum expenditure targets for mobility R&D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | grant BorgWarner and the BorgWarner JV rights of first refusal to manufacture products in Legacy Romeo’s field if Legacy Romeo proposes to expand its manufacturing capacity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide BorgWarner broad commercial rights to commercialize Romeo IP (or the option to acquire those rights for a payment) under circumstances involving the insolvency of Legacy Romeo, an event of default under any debt instrument, termination of the JV Agreement due to a breach or engagement with competitors of BorgWarner or the BorgWarner JV by Legacy Romeo;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | govern the management and funding mechanisms of the BorgWarner JV;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | include put and call options regarding the membership interests in the BorgWarner JV, as well as other customary provisions related to transfers or issuances of such interests;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obligate Legacy Romeo to provide engineering services to the BorgWarner JV to support customer applications; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | grant BorgWarner a first-priority security interest in our interest in the BorgWarner JV to secure the performance of Legacy Romeo’s obligations under any agreement relating to the BorgWarner JV or BorgWarner’s investment in Legacy Romeo.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We learned on February 15, 2021 of BorgWarner’s intention to acquire control of AKASOL AG, a competitor of ours, and we are currently evaluating what such acquisition will mean for the BorgWarner JV.
Allocation of Rights Under Romeo IP
Under the IP License, Legacy Romeo is licensed to commercialize the Romeo IP solely in connection with:

● | stationary applications worldwide; and
--+---------------------------------------


● | on-road vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight rating (“GVWR”) greater than 20,000 lbs., certain recreational vehicles, and specialty market applications, in each case that are manufactured and sold in North America.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legacy Romeo’s right under the IP License to manufacture products that would exceed the planned 6.8 GWh annual production capacity of our current manufacturing facility is subject to rights of first refusal in favor of the BorgWarner JV and BorgWarner.

12



The BorgWarner JV has the right under the IP License to commercialize Romeo IP in certain fields and territories other than those granted to Legacy Romeo (e.g., all mobility applications that are manufactured and sold outside of North America and all on-road vehicles having a GVWR of 20,000 lbs. or less that are manufactured and sold in North America).
Royalty
Each year, the BorgWarner JV must pay Legacy Romeo a royalty for use of Romeo IP (the “Romeo IP Royalty”), subject to Legacy Romeo satisfying minimum expenditure targets for mobility R&D.
The Romeo IP Royalty is a function of the BorgWarner JV’s revenue. In any fiscal year, the Romeo IP Royalty will be:

● | 3% of the first $100 million of the BorgWarner JV’s revenue, plus
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 1% of the next $400 million of the BorgWarner JV’s revenue, plus
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | 0.75% of the next $500 million of the BorgWarner JV’s revenue, plus
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 0.5% of the next $4 billion of the BorgWarner JV’s revenue, plus
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | 0.25% of any additional BorgWarner JV revenue.
--+-----------------------------------------------

To date, the BorgWarner JV has not had any revenue.
R&D; Technology Transfer
BorgWarner is entitled to direct, prioritize and approve Legacy Romeo’s R&D activities focused on mobility applications. Further, BorgWarner is entitled to approve Legacy Romeo’s overall R&D budget.
Rights of First Refusal
If Legacy Romeo proposes to expand manufacturing in its lines of business other than stationary applications (i.e., commercial vehicles having a GVWR greater than 20,000 lbs., recreational vehicles and/or specialty items) to an extent that would cause total manufacturing production (including stationary applications) to exceed our projected 6.8 GWh manufacturing capacity, the BorgWarner JV will have a right of first refusal to incorporate that manufacturing expansion into its business.
If Legacy Romeo proposes to expand its stationary application business by selling outside of North America or by growing that business to an extent that would cause total production (including mobility applications) to exceed its current production capacity at any time during the period that BorgWarner and Legacy Romeo are both members of the BorgWarner JV and continuing for three years thereafter, BorgWarner will have a right of first refusal to partner with Legacy Romeo under a structure that is similar to the BorgWarner JV under the JV Agreement, with details to be negotiated by the parties.
In the event the BorgWarner JV and BorgWarner do not exercise their respective rights of first refusal, the JV Agreement and the IP License arguably could be interpreted by BorgWarner to limit Legacy Romeo’s rights under the IP License to our projected 6.8 GWh manufacturing capacity.
Management of the BorgWarner JV
The BorgWarner JV is managed by a board of directors (the “JV Board”) comprised of three members, two of whom are appointed by BorgWarner and one of whom is appointed by Legacy Romeo. All decisions are made by a majority vote of the members of the JV Board, except for certain specified material actions involving the BorgWarner JV that require 

13



unanimous approval, including approval of annual budgets, selling or purchasing material assets, business combinations, assigning or licensing material intellectual property, insolvency and equity and debt issuances.
Capital Calls
The JV Board may from time to time determine that the BorgWarner JV requires additional capital and, in that event, may issue capital calls as frequently as twice per year. The amount of such calls must be consistent with the annual budget, which must be approved by both Legacy Romeo and BorgWarner, but is not otherwise limited. While Legacy Romeo has no obligation to participate in any capital call, if we decline or lack the funds required to participate in any capital call (within 150 days of receiving notice), BorgWarner may purchase our equity allocation at the per-unit price of equity when the BorgWarner JV was formed. The JV Board determined the capital needs of the BorgWarner JV for 2021 to be an additional $10.0 million. Legacy Romeo contributed its pro rata share of $4.0 million on January 21, 2021.
Put and Call Options
BorgWarner will have the right to purchase our entire interest in the BorgWarner JV at any time after June 28, 2022. The purchase price will be the value of our interest as determined by a mutually agreed independent appraiser using standard valuation methodologies taking into account a discount for lack of marketability (“Market Value”).
Additionally, commencing when the BorgWarner JV has its first significant and profitable business award in accordance with the BorgWarner JV’s financial model mutually agreed to by BorgWarner and Romeo, which has not yet occurred (or, if sooner, 18 months after the formation of the BorgWarner JV in the event the JV Board has determined not to terminate the JV Agreement), BorgWarner will have the right to put its membership interest in the BorgWarner JV to Legacy Romeo. The purchase price will be 90% of the Market Value of the interest if the put right is exercised on or prior to June 28, 2021, 95% if the put right is exercised after June 28, 2021 and on or prior to June 28, 2022 and 100% if the put right is exercised after June 28, 2022.
If BorgWarner or any of its affiliates directly competes with the BorgWarner JV in a manner that is materially adverse to the BorgWarner JV at any time prior to June 28, 2024, the price at which BorgWarner may exercise its call option will be the Market Value of our interest plus 20% if it is exercised after June 28, 2022 and on or prior to June 28, 2023, and 10% if it is exercised after June 28, 2023 and on or prior to June 28, 2024.
Transfer Restrictions, Preemptive Rights, Tag Along / Drag Along Rights
We may not transfer our interest in the BorgWarner JV, except that we may pledge our interest to a lender (subject to BorgWarner’s security interest).
Each of BorgWarner and Legacy Romeo has preemptive rights and the right to tag along with any sale by the other of its interest in the BorgWarner JV. BorgWarner further has the right to drag Legacy Romeo along with any sale by BorgWarner of its interest in the BorgWarner JV.
Application Engineering Services Agreement
We entered into an Application Engineering Services Agreement (the “AESA”) with the BorgWarner JV, under which we are obligated to provide to the BorgWarner JV services with respect to the design, testing and validation of battery pack and module products manufactured by the BorgWarner JV to meet the requirements of its customers. The amount that the BorgWarner JV will pay us for any project under the AESA will be set forth in the applicable statement of work. The BorgWarner JV will own all intellectual property rights in any new work product produced under the AESA.
Collaborative Arrangement with Heritage
We have also formed a collaborative arrangement with Heritage Battery Recycling, LLC (“HBR”), an affiliate of HES, to focus on sustainability and reuse applications of our battery technologies.

Pursuant to an agreement with HBR, dated October 2, 2020 (the “Heritage Agreement”), HBR has agreed to design, build and operate a system for redeploying, recycling or disposing of lithium-ion batteries (the “System”) to be located at HES’s facility in Arizona, and we have contributed $35 million to HBR to fund the building, operation, maintenance and repair of the System. Such agreement also provides that our batteries will receive first priority at the System for processing, subject to certain conditions, and we have committed to use HBR as our exclusive provider of lithium-ion battery recycling and disposal services, subject to certain exceptions.
HBR will own and operate the System. We will receive 30% of the profit generated by the System during the term of the Heritage Agreement, which consists of an initial term of ten years with automatic one-year renewals. In the event of an operating shortfall, we would fund 30% and HBR would fund 70% of such shortfall. The Heritage Agreement does not specify when the System is to be completed or start generating revenue. The initial contract duration is for a period of ten years from December 29, 2020, and the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms indefinitely. While the arrangement is in effect, it establishes a strategic collaboration with HES for the collection of our battery packs for recycling and gives our customers priority at the recycling facility.
If HBR decides to develop any future lithium-ion battery processing facilities in North America or Europe, we would have a right of first offer to participate in any such facility under terms to be agreed upon by the parties, provided that we commit to funding at least 30% of the cost of such facility.
We have also committed to fund up to $10 million to purchase ten BEV trucks and the charging infrastructure for a one-year pilot program to determine the feasibility of transitioning HES’s or its affiliates’ fleet of trucks from diesel powered vehicles to BEVs that each utilize battery packs not smaller than 150 kWh. If such pilot program is successful, the parties would enter into an agreement for the procurement through us of at least 500 BEVs on terms acceptable to HBR, HES and us. The participants in the pilot program have been selected, and the parties are beginning to work towards an agreement to support the pilot program.
Other Strategic Partnerships
In January 2021, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Republic Services, Inc. (“Republic”) to collaborate on the development of our battery technology for use in Republic’s electric garbage trucks. Republic is the second largest provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, disposal, recycling, and environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue.
In February 2021, we announced that we have entered into an MOU with Ecellix Inc., to cooperate in the development, validation and launch of next-generation battery technology. The MOU outlines the expectations for the two companies to negotiate in good faith to formalize a material supply agreement, partnership pricing, and a future equity investment. The MOU also forms a Steering Committee that will develop specific technical goals and objectives that will govern and drive the development of the partnership. These relationships are important in de-risking our business model, scaling the business, and delivering value to customers.
Intellectual Property and Technology
Our success depends in part on the innovations generated by our R&D group, on that group’s ability to continue to innovate effectively, and on protecting those innovations using patents, trade secrets and copyrights.
Intellectual Property
All of Legacy Romeo’s current and future intellectual property (with the exception of certain trademarks) has been assigned to Romeo Systems Technology, LLC, an intellectual property holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Romeo (“Romeo IP Holdco”). Romeo IP Holdco licenses Legacy Romeo’s intellectual property back to Legacy Romeo, the BorgWarner JV and BorgWarner Inc. as described above. See the section entitled “Business—Joint Venture with BorgWarner.”

Patents
We currently have one issued patent in the United States, five pending United States patent applications, with six invention disclosures based on which applications for additional patents may be prepared.
Additionally, we have three applications for patent pending in each of the European Patent Office, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and China and one Patent Cooperation Treaty application pending that is not yet in the national phase.
Trade Secrets
We protect our trade secrets and other confidential business information of any type by requiring our employees, contractors, customers and others who develop intellectual property (including confidential information) in the course of their work for us or to whom we disclose our confidential information to execute non-disclosure agreements, and we have implemented security protocols to protect our systems.
Copyrights
The software components of our BMS are protected by our copyrights from unauthorized adaptation, duplication or distribution.
Research and Development
The primary areas of focus of our R&D efforts have been thermal management for enhanced performance, longevity and safety; micro-laser welding manufacturing processes for higher throughput and more efficient use of floor space; BMS configurability to quickly and efficiently integrate our battery packs into customer platforms; and unique battery state monitoring and control algorithms for enhanced performance and safety.
Thermal Management
Our patent pending extruded cold plate is exceedingly thin and lightweight, yet sufficiently rigid to serve as a structural member. Its unique design has enabled us to increase the energy density and safety of our batteries and to manufacture them at lower cost. In addition, our proprietary bonding materials enhance thermal control effectiveness and electrical safety.
Our R&D teams are also working on entirely new thermal management technology for possible use in future generations of our products. Our patent pending innovations include the use of a cooling rod inside the battery cell and a vapor chamber and wick to draw heat using phase change technology. These initiatives are intended to enhance further the performance and safety of our next-generation products.
Micro-Laser Welding
Our patented micro-laser welding technology eliminates the need to extrude and solder wires. This technology greatly simplifies assembly processes, enabling us to configure our assembly lines for new products quickly and efficiently while increasing throughput and using floor space more efficiently. It also facilitates the efficient commercialization of product variations by shortening the development time for new system voltage configurations.
BMS
Our BMS is highly configurable, accommodating systems that are as small as 12 volts to as large as 1,000 volts. As a result, we are able to integrate our battery packs into customer platforms quickly and efficiently, without rebuilding or redesigning.

16



Additionally, our engineers have developed unique estimation and control algorithms that improve mileage through more accurate battery state monitoring and optimized charge and discharge cycles. They also enhance safety by early detection and remediation of hazardous conditions.
Customers and Backlog
We currently serve sixteen customers in North America. Our existing customers include leaders in the electric vehicle sector, as well as companies committed to reducing the overall environmental impact and fuel costs of their owned and operated truck and bus fleets. Our customers include commercial and high-performance electric vehicle manufacturers, fleet operators, and automobile and recreational vehicle manufacturers. We supply automotive OEMs and fleet customers. Several of our customers have diverse vehicle offerings spanning multiple weight classes, or they operate across continental boundaries. In those cases, batteries may be supplied by the BorgWarner JV as well as directly by Romeo.
Our customers value safety, serviceability, and energy density. Our systems are the safest as a result of the cell selection and the material configuration in the module and pack. We have single cell or multiple cell fault tolerance, which means during an incident, when a cell or multiple cells go into a thermal runaway, the propagation is contained. We also have the highest energy density in the market today, and, due to our BMS software and modular design specifications, we are able to service our packs for specific module replacements instead of full pack replacement. In addition, by design, our electronics and junction box are serviceable and easy to access.
We also have the capabilities to tailor our modular products to our customers’ application. An example of one application-specific important feature is the ability to recover energy during braking for trucks. The combination of cell selection, together with our thermal management interface, allows us to recover max load braking for 10 continuous minutes—the highest in the industry—and represents the scenario of a truck going down a mountain to reach the coastline.
Target Customers
Our business targets large truck and bus fleet customers with established sustainability goals, as well as fleets operating along dedicated routes located in regions offering strong incentives for delivering zero-emission vehicles. We also are seeking to expand our market share in the European commercial electric vehicle and high-performance, luxury electric vehicle industry through the BorgWarner JV.
Key Customers
Our current customers are located in North America. Our key customers include the following:
Nikola Motor Company
Nikola Motor Company (NASDAQ: NKLA) (“Nikola”) is a leading hybrid commercial truck manufacturer based in Phoenix, Arizona. We have a supply agreement dated August 28, 2020, to provide battery modules and packs, both custom and off-the-shelf, for Nikola’s electric trucks. The agreement requires us to develop a custom battery pack design using our off-the-shelf modules and battery management system. It also requires us to manufacture battery packs based on such custom design with the support of the BorgWarner JV. The term of the agreement runs until three years after we complete such design and commence commercial production of the custom battery packs. Nikola is committed to purchase approximately $243 million of battery modules and packs, subject to our compliance with customary quality and delivery requirements. The agreement does not specify financial penalties or minimum payment amounts if Nikola fails to satisfy its purchase commitment. If Nikola were to breach its minimum purchase commitment (for reasons other than our serious quality control deficiencies or failure to perform our obligations under the agreement), then we would have customary remedies for breach of contract, subject to an agreed limitation on damages of amounts paid or payable under the agreement in the 12 months before such breach occurs.

17



Lightning Systems
Lightning Systems, Inc. (“Lightning”) designs and manufactures zero-emission all-electric powertrains for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, including delivery trucks, shuttle buses, passenger vans, chassis-cab models, and city transit buses. We have a supply agreement dated July 13, 2020, to supply off-the-shelf battery modules and packs across Lightning’s electric vehicle portfolio. The initial term of the agreement runs through December 31, 2024, with automatic one-year renewals unless either party decides not to renew. Lightning is committed to purchase approximately $56 million of battery modules and packs during the initial term, subject to our successful conclusion of customary tests of our products. If Lightning’s orders fall short of its commitment, it would be required to pay a make-whole payment based on the amount of its shortfall.
Lion Buses Inc.
Lion Buses Inc. (“Lion”) is a leading battery electric bus and truck manufacturer based in Saint-Jérôme, Canada. On November 2, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lion to supply it battery modules and packs, with a minimum purchase commitment of approximately $234 million of battery modules and packs during the five-year initial term of the agreement. Lion’s purchase obligation is conditioned on Lion completing a customary technical and manufacturability assessment, commonly known as a failure mode and effects analysis (“FMEA”). The FMEA was completed in early 2021. We committed to using our best commercial efforts to have our fleet manager partners purchase Lion vehicles.
BorgWarner JV
The BorgWarner JV is a joint venture between us and a subsidiary of Tier 1 automotive supplier BorgWarner to manufacture and sell battery packs and modules to manufacturers of electric commercial vehicles outside North America and of other electric vehicles globally. Under our agreements with BorgWarner and the BorgWarner JV, we provide engineering services to support R&D activities and are entitled to receive royalties based on products sold by the BorgWarner JV. Consequently, the BorgWarner JV is considered to be one of our key customers. See the section entitled “Business— Joint Venture with BorgWarner” for a more complete summary of the terms of the BorgWarner JV.
Customer Concentration
Historically, we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, BorgWarner JV engineering services revenue accounted for 35% of our total revenue, and Nikola and Hexagon Purus AS accounted for approximately 28% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Agility Fuel Systems LLC and Zume, Inc. together accounted for approximately 74% of our total revenue, and the BorgWarner JV engineering services revenue accounted for 23% of our total revenue. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to contribute a significant portion of our sales in the near future although over time we expect greater customer diversification. Our ability to maintain close relationships with these top customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business.

18



Customer Backlog
We define contracted revenue (or “backlog”) as revenue expected to be received under our existing customer contracts from sales of battery packs, modules, battery management system software and services not yet built and delivered or provided. As of December 31, 2020, we had a backlog of approximately $555 million. For $312 million out of the $555 million of backlog related to minimum quantity purchase commitments, if the customers do not follow through on their minimum purchase commitments, we would receive a maximum of $293 million under certain make-whole provisions included in these contracts. For the remaining $243 million of backlog related to minimum quantity purchase commitments included in these contracts, if the customers do not follow through on their minimum purchase commitments, we would seek damages through customary remedies for breach of contract. The portion of our backlog as of December 31, 2020, that is expected to be recognized in the twelve-month period following December 31, 2020 is approximately $23.4 million. The remaining backlog balance of approximately $532 million is expected to be recognized between 2022 and 2024. The difference between our backlog and our minimum revenue that would be received in satisfaction of take or pay minimum order commitments reflects that our backlog does not represent a guarantee that our customers will complete purchases of our products and services in the quantities that we anticipate, and some of our contracts allow our customers to purchase in smaller quantities with certain minimum order penalties. Backlog includes the total value of our existing customer contracts and includes products that are within the scope of the license granted to the BorgWarner JV, based on the types of customer vehicles in which the products will be used. To the extent that those products are fulfilled by the BorgWarner JV, or pursuant to an agreement with the BorgWarner JV, we may not recognize the full amount of such contracted backlog as revenue. All contracted revenue amounts also assume continued performance of our contractual obligations and satisfaction of customary testing and quality required under each customer contract.
Competition
The energy technology and energy storage industry is highly competitive, and new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances, and shifting customer demands are causing the industry to evolve towards zero-emission solutions. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market include, but are not limited to:

● | total cost of ownership (“TCO”);
--+---------------------------------


● | safety, reliability and quality;
--+---------------------------------


● | gravimetric and volumetric energy density;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | product performance and uptime;
--+--------------------------------


● | charging characteristics;
--+--------------------------


● | technological innovation;
--+--------------------------


● | comprehensive solution from a single provider;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | ease of integration; and
--+-------------------------


● | service options.
--+-----------------

Similar to traditional OEMs in the passenger vehicle market, incumbent commercial transportation OEMs are burdened with legacy systems and the need to generate sufficient return on existing infrastructure, which has created a reluctance to embrace new zero-emission drivetrain technology. This reluctance creates opportunity for us and has allowed us to gain a significant head start against our competition. We believe the global push for lower emissions combined with vast technological improvements in fuel cell and battery-electric powertrain technologies have encouraged well-established vehicle manufacturers to begin investing in zero-emission vehicle platforms.

19



Our key competitors include battery pack producers like AKASOL AG and Kreisel Electric. The strong vertical position of cell suppliers like Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) and Samsung SDI reinforces the value of our cell agnostic strategy. We believe that we are positioned to compete favorably in the market for electric vehicle battery packs. Although we do not have the same name recognition or operating histories as many of our competitors, we are free from the burden of legacy infrastructure and design. We have the benefit of a head start and the advantage of beginning from a blank slate, which is critical when introducing revolutionary technology.
Our competitive advantages include the highest energy density, longest range, and fastest charge time. Our battery packs have high stability and superior thermal management. Our high volume of U.S.-based manufacturing, and competitive TCO are also key differentiators in the market.
Our high safety requirements are a significant strategic advantage and a major selling point against the competition. Our safety methodology is verified both internally, and by independent external entities like Underwriters Laboratories. Further, our design capabilities, advanced proprietary technology, and the flexibility to manufacture to design allows us to supply customers with exactly what they need at a low cost.
Suppliers
Our products use parts that are sourced from suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key components of our battery products, in particular battery cells. We also work closely with suppliers to develop novel materials or configurations for specifically desired functionality within our system design. Certain components purchased from suppliers are common across our product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.
The price we pay for battery cells depends on a number of factors, including material grades of chemistry selected for cell recipe, volumes, long-term commitment, logistics and shipping, and tariffs. The cost of battery cells also depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. Costs for these raw materials have increased due to higher production costs and demand surges in the EV market which may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through our products or services. See the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Current Market Conditions" for additional information.

Sales and Marketing
We have the technology, manufacturing knowledge and determination to maximize our market share in the United States, Mexico and Canada. We have similar aspirations within the BorgWarner JV for Europe and Asia. We take an insight-driven, strategic approach to our go-to-market strategy. Sales activities are generally carried out by our full-time sales employees. We believe that our relationships with existing customers are strong, both with the incumbents and new entrants in the commercial vehicle market. As our customers’ product pipeline expands, these entities will continue to be a source of organic growth. We will hire additional sales staff throughout 2021 to increase substantially our presence at battery technology expos and provide regular thought leadership in industry publications.
Research and Development
Our R&D activities primarily take place at our manufacturing facility in Vernon, California.
The primary areas of focus for R&D include, but are not limited to, thermofluidics, materials science, stress engineering, cell chemistry, process technology, dissimilar metal joining, electronics, algorithms and safety. We undertake significant testing and validation of our products in order to ensure that we will meet the demands of our customers. We expect our R&D expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in R&D activities to expand our product offering for both the U.S. and the European markets.

Government Regulation
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
Facility Operations
We operate from a single, dedicated electric vehicle battery pack manufacturing facility located in Vernon, California. Operations at our Vernon, California facility are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials. To conduct our operations, we have to obtain environmental, health, and safety permits and registrations and prepare plans. We are subject to inspections and possible citations by federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety regulators. In transit, lithium-ion batteries are subject to rules governing the transportation of “dangerous goods.” We have policies and programs in place to assure compliance with our obligations (for example, machine guarding, hot work, hazardous material management and transportation). We train our employees and conduct audits of our operations to assess our fulfillment of these policies.
We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances. Under the law, we can be liable even if we did not cause a release on real property that we lease. We believe we have taken commercially reasonable steps to avoid such liability with respect to our leased Vernon facility. Our facility is located in the city of Vernon, California, which is well known for its long industrial history. As with many sites in Vernon, there is onsite contamination below our facility in the form of soil vapors. However, there is currently no requirement to investigate or remediate this onsite contamination. Since we began operations at the Vernon facility in 2017, we have no reason to believe that our operations contributed to the contamination or otherwise caused any onsite releases. Liability to address these historical conditions rests primarily with the landlord of the Vernon facility and companies that originally released contaminants causing the soil vapors. However, as noted above, we could be held liable in certain limited circumstances as the lessee and operator of the Vernon facility. Ultimately, we do not believe that these soil vapor conditions represent a material risk.
Product Stewardship
We recognize that large-scale global adoption of lithium-ion batteries will require cost-effective recycling processes. Accordingly, we have a product stewardship program that addresses both ease of disassembly of our battery packs and collection. Balancing necessary ease of battery disassembly with safety and durability requirements, our battery packs’ layered design and low content of adhesives make separation processes less complex and recycling more cost effective. Romeo battery packs can have a “second life” as refurbished batteries or for use in stationary storage application for which reduced performance capability is acceptable.
We have also formed a collaborative arrangement with HBR, an affiliate of HES, for the collection of our battery packs for recycling. HES has a long history of recycling all types of batteries. See the section entitled “Business—Collaborative Arrangement with Heritage.”
Buy America
The U.S. “Buy America” requirements impose price differentials or prohibitions on procurement of products purchased under certain U.S. government programs. The price differentials or prohibitions apply to products that are not produced in the U.S. or that do not contain U.S. components making up at least 50% of the total cost of all components in the product. Our products are designed and manufactured in the U.S. and qualify as “domestic origin” for purposes of “Buy America” requirements, which offers us an advantage to supply to customers who are subject to such requirements.
