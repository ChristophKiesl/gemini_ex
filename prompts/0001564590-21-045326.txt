 Impact of COVID-19
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak, governmental authorities implemented numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. In certain countries in which we operate, governments took swift and effective measures to stem the spread, while in other countries in which we operate governments were slow to react or missed opportunities to effectively contain the spread. Although some of these restrictions and other containment measures have since been lifted or scaled back, ongoing surges of COVID-19 have resulted in the re-imposition of certain restrictions and containment measures and may lead to other restrictions being re-implemented in the future in response to efforts to reduce the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants.
 The health and wellbeing of our workforce is our highest priority.  Many of our employees have worked from home since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic in order to minimize the potential risk of spread of COVID-19 in our office environment.  As the broad roll out of vaccines continues in various countries in which we operate, many employees have returned to the office environment on a part- or full-time basis.  As more employees return to the office, we will continue to adhere to return to work protocols, based on guidance from local and global health organizations and applicable laws and regulations.
 While the severity and duration of business disruption to our customers and suppliers due to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain, we expect that the ongoing global vaccination programs will moderate the overall severity and duration and remain cautiously optimistic the most significant impact has passed.  If more infectious COVID-19 variants become resistant to the existing vaccines, however, we could experience renewed and sustained business disruption.  To date, we have not incurred significant disruptions to our business or a materially negative impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition from the COVID-19 outbreak, and continue to believe our business will not be severely impacted as steps continue to be taken globally to mitigate the spread, vaccinate large portions of the population and achieve herd immunity.
 We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of the impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition and may take further actions altering our business operations and managing our costs and liquidity that we deem necessary or appropriate to respond to this fast moving and uncertain global health crisis and the resulting global economic consequences.

 Capacitive Fingerprint Sensing Technology.  Our fingerprint sensing technology simplifies the system or application authentication process by substituting the user’s fingerprint for the login name and password. Our capacitive fingerprint sensing technology provides for fingerprint authentication by scanning and matching an image of a user’s fingerprint, as well as initial fingerprint enrollment.  Our sensing technology also incorporates spoof detection and includes many implementation choices including the back of the phone or PC, button integration, touchpad integration, and under glass.
 Capacitive Position and Force Sensing Technology.  Our Position Sensing technology provides a method for sensing the presence, position, and contact area of one or more fingers or a stylus on a flat or curved surface.  Our technology works with very light touch, supports full multi-touch capabilities, and provides highly responsive cursor navigation, scrolling, and selection.  It uses no moving parts, can be implemented under plastic or glass, and is extremely durable.  Our technology can also track one or more fingers in proximity to the touch surface. Our Force Sensing technology senses the direction and magnitude of a force applied to an object.  The object can either move when force is applied, like a typical joystick used for gaming applications, or it can be isometric, with no perceptible motion during use, like our TouchStyk, ForcePad, or ClearForce.  The primary competition for this technology is resistive strain gauge technology.  Our electronic circuitry determines the magnitude and direction of an applied force, permits very accurate sensing of tiny changes in capacitance, and minimizes electrical interference from other sources.  Our capacitive force sensing technology can be integrated with our position sensing technology.
 Capacitive Active Pen Technology.  This technology allows us to develop a pen that can be used for input on a capacitive touchscreen.  As well as generating a signal that allows the touchscreen to track the pen, additional data, such as the pen applied force and pen button states, are also communicated to the touchscreen device.  Information can also be communicated from the touchscreen to the pen.
 Multi-touch Technology.  This technology allows us to create capacitive touch products that simultaneously track the presence, position, and other characteristics of multiple objects in contact with or in close proximity to a flat or curved touch surface.  It enables, for example, the recognition of multi-finger gestures, the tracking of a stylus position while the user’s palm is also in contact with the touch surface, and the simultaneous interaction of multiple users with the same touch surface.
 Display Systems and Circuit Technology.  This technology enables us to develop optimized human experience semiconductor product solutions with improved compatibility with their application environments. This technology consists of mobile and large format display semiconductor expertise, including the following functional blocks:

The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions.
 12

Sales and Marketing
 We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers.  We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers.  Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions.  Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process.
 As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed 189 sales and marketing professionals.  We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the U.S., Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Japan, and Europe.  In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors that are primarily located in the U.S., China, Korea and Taiwan.
 International sales constituted over 98% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. Approximately 68%, 78%, and 78% of our sales in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major notebook computer and mobile product applications OEMs.  Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars.  This information should be read in conjunction with Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.
 Manufacturing
 We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships.  We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications.  The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom interface products or processed as our ASIC-based solution.
 After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers.  During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom human experience solution or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good.  The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products.
 We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment.  
 Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements.  As a result of recent supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we have entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers.  Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply.  We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available.  In some cases, we have alternative sources of suppliers to mitigate supplier risk; however, in the current environment, all of them could be constrained.  We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any one source of supply.
 Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order.  In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue.  We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations.  In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand declines.
