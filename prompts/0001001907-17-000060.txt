Our Business Units

Astro Scientific

Astro Scientific is a technology incubator that commercializes innovative technologies. Subsidiaries 1st Detect and Astrogenetix currently reside in Astro Scientific:

1st Detect

1st Detect develops, manufactures, and sells chemical analyzers for use in the airport security, military, and breath analysis markets. Our chemical analyzers can identify chemicals with more accuracy and precision than competing analyzers given their extreme sensitivity and specificity. By leveraging a concept from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a preliminary design initiated by an engagement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) to develop a mass spectrometer for the International Space Station, the Company developed a chemical analyzer that enables real-time analytics that we believe to be significantly smaller, lighter, faster, and less expensive than competing analyzers. The majority of revenue in 1st Detect comes from working as a subcontractor on government contracts. The Company works with prime contractors in adapting our technology to be used in enhancing the government’s detection capabilities for a variety of applications.
Astrogenetix

Astrogenetix is applying a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the International Space Station to develop vaccines and other therapeutics. NASA has engaged the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland (“UMD”), one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, to aid in the filing of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application of a vaccine for Salmonella. NASA is collaborating with UMD, meaning little investment is required of Astrogenetix at this stage. Once an IND is filed, we will be seeking partnership with a pharmaceutical company to complete the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval process and to ultimately commercialize the vaccine.
Astral Images

Astral Images sells film-to-digital conversion, high-dynamic range conversion, image enhancement, defect removal, and color correction services. Astral uses its powerful artificial intelligence (“AI”) algorithms to provide automated conversion of television and feature 35mm and 16mm films to the new 4K/HDR format, the standard for the latest generation of digital film distribution to the home. Due to a significant shift in the film scanning industry, most film assets will need to go through an upgrade to the new standard to remain relevant for over-the-top distribution (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.) as television manufacturers sell more 4K/HDR televisions and consumer demand for such content accelerates. Astral is positioned to be a leader in the digital conversion of feature films, film-based television series, sporting events shot on film, film libraries, and film archives. Astral has introduced to the digital conversion market Black ICE™ for the conversion of black and white film, Color ICE™ for the conversion of color film, and HDR ICE™ for the conversion of color film or digital video to the new HDR format. Astral’s platform technology is also being designed to launch a targeted solution that will convert photographs, negatives, and slides to a digital format while employing its AI algorithms to restore the image to its original condition in automation.
Business Strategy

Astro Scientific
1st Detect
Due to the high-speed performance, analytical capability, and flexibility of our product, our best opportunities involve government programs in aviation security, the military, breath analysis, and in applications where real-time or in-situ monitoring is required. 
There are currently approximately 25,000 ion mobility spectrometry (“IMS”) instruments installed today, with most nearing their end of life. As the current generation of IMS technology is replaced, we are positioning the Company to be the best next-generation solution for this market. We have partnered with an incumbent provider of IMS instrumentation to airports to deliver an instrument to the Transportation and Security Administration (“TSA”) with far greater capabilities than IMS. Together with our partner, we were awarded a grant for the Air Cargo and Next Generation Checkpoint program with the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (“DHS S&T”), whereby we delivered the mass spectrometer portion of the instrument. We recently completed the first phase of the program and our technology was well received by TSA, but there is no guarantee of subsequent phases. We have therefore launched efforts internally to create a full product solution for the TSA called the Tracer 
6

1000 MS-ETD as we work toward having the world’s first Explosives Trace Detector (“ETD”) driven by a mass spectrometer. With mass spectrometry being the gold standard of chemical detection, a mass spectrometry-based ETD will significantly reduce the number of false positives and allow for a much more expansive library of compounds of interest as compared to IMS-based ETDs.
The military is also looking to enhance its chemical detection capabilities and, on September 11, 2014, we announced that, together with Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”), one of the leading providers of instrumentation to the military, we were awarded a grant for the NGCD program with the Department of Defense’s (“DOD”) Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (“JPEO-CBD”) for one of the three variants in the Next Generation Chemical Detector (“NGCD”) program called the Multi-Sample Identifier/Multi-Sample Identifier Collector variant. The first stage of the three stage program was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. If we win the procurement, the military will procure an estimated 770 units to be used for the following purposes:

• | Evaluating the presence of chemicals after suspected chemical release incidents;


• | Continuously evaluating surface contamination following a chemical release to characterize contamination levels;


• | Evaluating the presence of contamination at a sample site; and


• | Confirming decontamination of potentially contaminated personnel and equipment.

 Our portion of the contract was successfully completed and delivered to the government; however, Battelle has indicated that they do not plan to pursue the next phase of the program. We are currently evaluating our options for remaining in the competition.
In addition, we have partnered with UTHSA in the development of the BreathDetect 1000, a mass spectrometry-based instrument that is being used to analyze human breath in real-time, enabling detection of bacterial infections in the respiratory tract within minutes. We have entered pre-clinical trials working with cystic fibrosis patients at UTHSA, focusing on identifying HAP, one of the biggest and most expensive problems in hospitals with over 150,000 cases reported annually. Such identification can significantly enhance the physicians’ ability to treat patients correctly. With current diagnosis methods, physicians wait up to three days for the lab to identify the organism, and another two days to receive the antibiotic resistance profile. In the meantime, they prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, leading to the urgent public health threat of antibiotic resistance and contributing to the re-emergence of deadly diseases such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”). The appropriate real-time diagnosis can lead to immediate administration of the appropriate antibiotics, reduce antibiotic resistance, decrease the length of hospital stays, and most importantly, save lives. 
While most of our activities have been focused on delivering on the TSA, military, and breath analysis programs, there is significant opportunity in the industrial and commercial markets as well. Such markets are large and diverse, often requiring customized solutions to satisfy customer needs. Significant effort is therefore only reserved for customer-funded joint development programs or programs with large markets where our technology has a unique differentiator.
Astrogenetix
Astrogenetix is applying a fast-track, on-orbit discovery platform using the International Space Station to develop vaccines and other therapeutics. NASA has engaged the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland, one of the leading vaccinology institutions in the world, to aid in the filing of an IND application of a vaccine for Salmonella. NASA is collaborating with UMD, meaning little investment is required of Astrogenetix at this stage. Once an IND is filed, we will be seeking partnership with a pharmaceutical company to complete the FDA approval process and to ultimately commercialize the vaccine.
Astral Images
Astral Images was launched to commercialize identified government-funded satellite image correction technologies. Along with the acquisition of certain established defect correction technologies, first funded by IBM and Kodak, we believe that Astral is positioned to be a leader in the automated image correction and enhancement industry. We aim for Astral to offer compelling innovative technology solutions that deliver high-quality images and derive high levels of efficiencies through its powerful AI platform to an industry that traditionally relies on expensive manual labor for image correction and enhancement that can be inconsistent and fraught with errors and omissions. Our efforts are currently focused on educating content owners on our industry-leading technology, which includes our digital conversion and enhancement software and our HDR software, Astral HDR ICE™, as the industry prepares to expend a considerable amount of resources on converting their film assets to the new 4K/HDR standards.

Customers, Sales, and Marketing

Astro Scientific
1st Detect

1st Detect’s customers include government agencies, research organizations, and industrial companies. Customers have either purchased or leased our instrumentation to evaluate the core technology in connection with exploring joint development of a customized solution or an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) distribution relationship with 1st Detect. Efforts continue to be focused on the development of the DHS S&T and NGCD products, developing the breath analysis market, and acquiring additional joint development partners.
Astrogenetix

Astrogenetix does not currently sell products to the market. Instead, its efforts are focused on filing an IND application with the FDA for a Salmonella vaccine.
Astral Images
Astral’s target customers are content creators and owners such as film studios, libraries, archives, and content processors such as post-production entities and distribution networks. Astral is positioned to leverage the demand generated for 4K/HDR content by the release of the new 4K/HDR standard and the growth in sales of next-generation 4K/HDR televisions. Consumers are increasingly demanding content that is optimized for their new televisions, but the conversion of content lags the sale of televisions capable of displaying that content, similar to what we saw with the proliferation of HDTV and 3D. In order to remain relevant in over-the-top distribution (Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc.), content owners will need to convert their content to conform to the new standards.
Astral’s platform technology is also being designed to launch a targeted solution that will convert photographs, negatives, and slides to a digital format while employing its advanced AI algorithms to restore images to their original condition in automation. Customers will include consumers that possess the over one trillion photographs that are fading and deteriorating in attics, basements, and storage cupboards in the United States.
Competition

Astro Scientific

1st Detect

Competition with 1st Detect’s mass spectrometer comes from traditional mass spectrometers and from other chemical sensors based on different technologies, primarily IMS.
There are several vendors that compete directly with 1st Detect’s mass spectrometer. However, 1st Detect products combine a number of attributes in a single product not currently available in other products. 1st Detect’s competitive advantages include:

• | Our technology allows for near instantaneous results with laboratory-quality sensitivity, specificity, and performance. This compares to traditional mass spectrometers that are very expensive, can take up to several hours for a single analysis, and require a cumbersome clear-out and recalibration process between analyses.

9


• | Our price point is significantly less than a traditional mass spectrometer, becoming the first instrument that can provide superior mass spectrometry results at a price point similar to technologically inferior IMS instruments, which can only detect a limited number of chemicals and are prone to false results.


• | The 1st Detect offering is significantly smaller, lighter, and much more portable than most other mass spectrometers. Our mass spectrometer can operate from an automobile’s cigarette lighter port, while traditional mass spectrometers are permanently situated on a table in a laboratory and require 500 watts or more to operate.


• | Our tandem mass spectrometry capability that is integrated with our standard software further improves the specificity of our instrument without the need for additional hardware. This feature isolates specific chemicals of interest so they can be further fragmented in the trap to provide a secondary confirmation of an analysis. Such a feature is usually only available in very expensive laboratory instruments.


• | Sinusoidal Multiplexed Array in Real Time (“SMART”) is a feature that eliminates dominant chemicals that may be masking weaker chemicals of interest.


• | We provide “all of the data, all of the time.” This attribute allows customers to review the historical results of their manufacturing process, enabling them to quickly identify sources of contamination, unexpected reduced quality of product, and unusual excursions that are often unanticipated. Competitive offerings generally lack this important ability.


• | Developed as a platform technology, 1st Detect is able to be adapted to a wider variety of applications than most competing purpose-built instruments.

Astrogenetix

There are many developers of vaccines, including most large pharmaceutical companies and many smaller biotechnology firms. However, there are no known competitors to Astrogenetix’s microgravity vaccine development platform. With the International Space Station’s designation as a national laboratory and with emphasis on providing a research platform through 2020, competition from foreign governments, academia, and commercial companies is anticipated.
Astral Images
Astral Images faces significant competition from several vendors in the scanning and restoration services industry. Our competitors are independent scanning boutiques at one end of the spectrum, and at the other end, fully-integrated post-production houses offering a breadth of services, including scanning and restoration. However, the level of automation provided by our AI algorithms gives us compelling cost advantages while maintaining the high image quality customers have come to expect. Our solutions are scalable, cost effective, and more consistent when compared to competitors’ traditional manual approaches.
Astral’s competition for restoration of photographs, slides, and negatives comes from photography specialty stores and photograph digitization companies. Such companies employ a laborious and expensive process whereby scanners are used to convert the images to a digital format, and, if the company offers restoration, it is done manually using photo editing software.

Certain Regulatory Matters

We are subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We are also beholden to certain regulations designed to protect our domestic technology from unintended foreign exploitation and regulate certain business practices. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and consequential financial liability. Our operations are also subject to various regulations under federal laws regarding the international transfer of technology, as well as to various federal and state laws related to business operations. In addition, we are subject to federal contracting procedures, audit, and oversight. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and technology export requirements has not had and, we believe, will not have in the future, material effects on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Federal regulations that impact our operations include the following:

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act establishes rules for U.S. companies doing business internationally. Compliance with these rules is achieved through established and enforced corporate policies, documented internal procedures, and financial controls.

Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. This act authorizes the President of the United States to take punitive action against individuals or organizations known to be providing material aid to weapons of mass destruction programs in Iran. 

Federal Acquisition Regulations. Goods and services provided by us to U.S. Government agencies are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”). These regulations provide rules and procedures for invoicing, documenting, and conducting business under contract with such entities. The FAR also subjects us to audit by federal auditors to confirm such compliance.
Truth in Negotiations Act. The Truth in Negotiations Act was enacted for the purpose of providing full and fair disclosure by contractors in the conduct of negotiations with the U.S. Government. The most significant provision included in the Truth in Negotiations Act is the requirement that contractors submit certified cost and pricing data for negotiated procurements above a defined threshold.

Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management

We maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and manage our risks through a program of compliance, awareness, and insurance, which includes maintaining certain insurances and a continued emphasis on safety to mitigate any risks.
Employees Update

As of June 30, 2017, we employed 42 regular full-time employees, none of which were covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
