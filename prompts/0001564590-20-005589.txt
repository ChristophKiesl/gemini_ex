Item 1. Business Overview
BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 CIT Group Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively “we”, “our”, “CIT” or the “Company”), is a bank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company (“FHC”) with $46 billion of earning assets and total deposits of $35 billion at December 31, 2019. CIT was formed in 1908 and provides financing, leasing and advisory services principally to middle-market companies and small businesses in a wide variety of industries, primarily in North America. CIT also provides banking and related services to commercial and individual customers through our banking subsidiary, CIT Bank, N.A. (“CIT Bank”), which includes over 60 branches located in Southern California and its online bank. Visit cit.com.
 CIT is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). CIT Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("OCC").
 On January 1, 2020, we acquired Mutual of Omaha Bank (“MOB”), the savings bank subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company and Omaha Financial Holdings, Inc. (“OFHI”). CIT paid approximately $1 billion as consideration, comprised of $850 million in cash and approximately 3.1 million shares of CIT Group Inc. common stock (valued at approximately $141 million at the time of closing). Total assets acquired were approximately $8.4 billion and deposits were approximately $7.0 billion. Because the acquisition closed on January 1, 2020, balances and results of operations of MOB are not included in CIT’s reported financial results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of or for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2019 Form 10-K”). See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (“Item 8”), Note 29 — Subsequent Events and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) for additional information.
 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 As of December 31, 2019, we manage our business and report our financial results in two operating segments: Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking, and a non-operating segment, Corporate. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we modified our business segment reporting. The former segment Non-Strategic Portfolios (“NSP”), which included a nominal amount of loans held for sale at December 31, 2019, is now reported in Corporate. We also modified reporting of select asset balances and financial statistics at the division level in Commercial Banking. Our factoring business, Commercial Services, which was reported in the Business Capital division, is now reported in the Commercial Finance division. In addition, an equipment financing portfolio consisting mostly of large ticket leases was transferred from Business Capital to Commercial Finance. Also, in Consumer Banking, Other Consumer Banking was renamed Consumer and Community Banking. All segment data included in this 2019 Form 10-K has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

 COMMERCIAL BANKING
 Commercial Banking provides a range of lending, leasing and deposit products, as well as ancillary products that include interest rate risk management and foreign exchange products, and services, including factoring, cash management, capital markets, asset management, and advisory services, primarily to small and medium-sized companies, as well as to the rail industry. Revenue is generated from interest earned on loans, rent on equipment leased, fees and other revenue from lending and leasing activities, banking services, and capital markets transactions, along with commissions earned on factoring and related activities. We source our commercial lending business primarily through direct marketing to borrowers, lessees, manufacturers, vendors and distributors, and through referral sources and other intermediaries. Periodically we buy participations in syndications of loans and lines of credit and purchase loans on a whole-loan basis. 
 Commercial Banking is comprised of four divisions, Commercial Finance, Business Capital, Rail, and Real Estate Finance.
 Description of Divisions
 Commercial Finance provides a range of commercial lending, leasing and deposit products, as well as ancillary services and products, including cash management, capital markets and advisory services, primarily to small and middle market companies in a wide range of industries, including aerospace & defense, aviation, communication, power and energy, entertainment, gaming, healthcare, industrials, maritime, restaurants, retail, services and technology. Loans offered are primarily senior secured loans collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, transportation equipment and/or intangibles, and are often used for working capital, plant expansion, acquisitions or recapitalizations. These loans include revolving lines of credit and term loans and, depending on the nature and quality of the collateral, may be referred to as collateral-backed loans, asset-based loans or cash flow loans. Loans are originated through relationships with private equity sponsors, or through direct relationships, led by originators with extensive experience in their respective industries. We also provide asset management services for which we collect management fees and partner in joint ventures. 
 In addition, through our Commercial Services business unit, we provide factoring, receivable management, and secured financing to businesses (our clients, who are generally manufacturers or importers of goods) that operate in several industries, including apparel, textile, furniture, home furnishings and consumer electronics. Factoring entails the assumption of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable arising from the sale of goods by our clients to their customers (generally retailers) that have been factored (i.e., sold or assigned to the factor).
 Business Capital provides leasing and equipment financing to small businesses and middle market companies in a wide range of industries on both an indirect and direct basis through integrated vendor platforms. In our indirect business, we assist manufacturers and distributors in growing sales, profitability and customer loyalty by providing customized, value-added finance solutions to their commercial clients. In our direct financing and leasing business, we provide financing solutions for our borrowers and lessees. Additionally, through Small Business Solutions, our on-line credit lending platform, we provide small business unsecured loans and equipment financing. Our lending platform allows small businesses to access commercial loans and leases, including both capital and operating leases, through a highly automated credit approval, documentation and funding process. 
 Rail offers customized leasing and financing solutions on a fleet of railcars and locomotives to railroads and shippers throughout North America. Railcar types include covered hopper cars used to ship grain and agricultural products, plastic pellets, sand, and cement; tank cars for energy products and chemicals; gondolas for coal, steel coil and mill service products; open hopper cars for coal and aggregates; boxcars for paper and auto parts, and centerbeams and flat cars for lumber. The rail portfolio is discussed further in the Concentrations section of the MD&A.
 Real Estate Finance provides senior secured commercial real estate loans to developers and other commercial real estate professionals. We focus on properties with a stable cash flow, provide financing to reposition existing properties, and originate construction loans to highly experienced and well capitalized developers. The division also includes a portfolio of acquired multi-family commercial mortgage loans in run-off.
Key Risks
 Key risks faced by the divisions include credit, business, market and asset risk. Credit risks associated with secured financings relate to the ability of our borrower to repay our loan and the value of the collateral underlying the loan should our borrower default on its obligations. Business risks include the demand for services that is broadly affected by the overall level of economic growth and is more specifically affected by the overall level of economic activity in CIT's target industries. Changes in supply and demand of products and services affect the pricing CIT can earn in the market. New business volume in Commercial Banking is affected by CIT's ability to maintain and develop relationships with its equity sponsors, clients, vendor partners, distributors and resellers. Commercial Banking is also exposed to market risk related to its syndication activity, which could expose CIT to risk arising from the inability to sell loans to other lenders, resulting in lower fee income and higher than expected credit exposure to certain borrowers.

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


The products and services provided by Commercial Services involve two types of credit risk: customer and client. A customer is the account debtor and obligor on trade accounts receivable that have been factored with and assigned to the factor. The most prevalent risk in factoring transactions for Commercial Services is customer credit risk, which relates to the financial inability of a customer to pay undisputed factored trade accounts receivable. A client is the counterparty to Commercial Services on any factoring, financing, or receivables purchasing agreement to sell trade receivables to Commercial Services, and generally is a manufacturer or importer of goods. While less significant than customer credit exposure, client credit risk relates to a decline in the creditworthiness of a borrowing client, their consequent inability to repay their loan, and the possible insufficiency of the underlying collateral (including the customer accounts receivable) to cover any loan repayment shortfall. 
 Commercial Services is also subject to a variety of other risks, including operational risk, due to the high transaction volume, business risks related to competitive pressures from other banks, boutique factors, and credit insurers, and seasonal risks due to retail trends. These pressures create risk of reduced pricing and factoring volume for CIT. In addition, client de-factoring can occur if retail credit conditions are benign for a long period and clients no longer demand factoring services for credit protection.
 The primary risks for Rail are asset risk (resulting from ownership of the railcars and related equipment on operating lease) and credit risk. Asset risk arises from fluctuations in supply and demand for the underlying rail equipment that is leased. Rail invests in long-lived equipment, railcars and locomotives, which have economic useful lives of approximately 40-50 years. This equipment is then leased to commercial end-users with lease terms of typically three to five years. CIT is exposed to the risk that, at the end of the lease term, the value of the asset will be lower than expected, resulting in reduced future lease income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value.
 Asset risk is generally recognized through changes to lease income streams from fluctuations in lease rates and/or utilization. Changes to lease income occur when the existing lease contract expires and is renewed at a lower rate or the asset comes off lease, and the business seeks to enter a new lease agreement. Asset risk may also change depreciation, resulting from changes in the residual value of the operating lease asset or through impairment of the asset carrying value, which can occur at any time during the life of the asset. Asset risk is primarily related to the Rail division, and to a lesser extent, Business Capital and Commercial Finance.
 Credit risk in the leased equipment portfolio results from the potential default of lessees, driven either by obligor specific or industry-wide conditions and is economically less significant than asset risk for Rail, because in the operating lease business there is no extension of credit to the obligor. Instead, the lessor deploys a portion of the useful life of the asset. Credit losses manifest through multiple parts of the income statement including loss of lease/rental income due to missed payments, time off lease, or lower rental payments than the existing contract due to either a restructuring with the existing obligor or re-leasing of the asset to another obligor, as well as higher expenses due to, for example, repossession costs to recover, refurbish, and re-lease assets.
 CONSUMER BANKING
 Consumer Banking includes Retail Banking, Consumer Lending, and SBA Lending, which are grouped together for purposes of discussion as Consumer and Community Banking, and LCM. We source our Consumer Lending business primarily through our branch network and industry referrals, as well as direct digital marketing efforts. Periodically we purchase loans on a whole-loan basis. We source our SBA loans through a network of SBA originators. We also make community development investments and loans that support the construction of affordable housing in our communities.
 Consumer and Community Banking offers consumer mortgage lending and deposit products to its consumer customers. The division offers conforming and jumbo residential mortgage loans throughout the United States. Mortgage loans are primarily originated through CIT Bank branches and retail referrals, employee referrals, internet leads, direct marketing and a correspondent lending channel. Additionally, loans are purchased through whole loan and portfolio acquisitions. Consumer Lending includes product specialists, internal sales support and origination processing, structuring and closing. Retail Banking is the primary deposit gathering business of CIT Bank and operates through a network of retail branches in Southern California and an online direct channel. We offer a broad range of deposit and lending products along with payment solutions to meet the needs of our clients (both individuals and small businesses), including checking, savings, money market, individual retirement accounts, and time deposits.
 The division also originates qualified SBA 504 loans and 7(a) loans. SBA 504 loans generally provide growing businesses with long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets, such as land and buildings. SBA 7(a) loans provide working capital, acquisition of inventory, machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures, the refinance of outstanding debt subject to any program guidelines, and acquisition of businesses, including partnership buyouts.
 LCM includes portfolios of SFR mortgages that are being run-off or sold. Certain of these loans were covered by loss sharing agreements (“LSAs”) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) against certain future losses sustained on these loans. Covered Loans were previously acquired by OneWest Bank, N.A. in connection with the LSAs for the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB (“IndyMac”) (expired March 2019), First Federal Bank of California, FSB (“First Federal”) (expired December 2019), and La Jolla Bank, FSB (“La Jolla”) (expiring February 2020).

Key Risks
 Key risks in Consumer Banking include credit, collateral and geographic concentration risk. Similar to our commercial business, credit risks associated with secured consumer financings relate to the ability of the borrower to repay its loan and the value of the collateral underlying the loan should the borrower default on its obligations. Our consumer mortgage loans are typically collateralized by the underlying property, primarily single-family homes. Therefore, collateral risk relates to the potential decline in value of the property securing the loan. A majority of the loans are concentrated in Southern California, resulting in geographic concentration risk related to a potential downturn in the economic conditions or a potential natural disaster, such as earthquakes, mudslides, or wildfires, in that region. 
 
See Risk Factors in Item 1A. and the Risk Management section in the MD&A for further discussions on risk.
 CIT BANK, N.A.
 CIT Bank is regulated by the OCC.
 CIT Bank raises deposits through its branch network of over 60 locations in Southern California, its online bank (visit cit.com), from retail and institutional customers through commercial channels, and, to a lesser extent, broker channels. CIT Bank's existing suite of deposit products includes checking, savings, money market, individual retirement accounts and time deposits.
 CIT Bank provides lending, leasing and other financial and advisory services, primarily to small and middle-market companies across select industries through its Commercial Finance, Rail, Real Estate Finance, and Business Capital divisions. The Bank also offers residential mortgage lending and deposits to its customers through its Consumer and Community Banking division. To help fulfill its community reinvestment act (“CRA”) obligations, CIT Bank provides equity investments, loans to support affordable housing and other community development activities, as well as grants and service-related activities, throughout its assessment area in Southern California.
 CIT Bank's loans and leases are primarily commercial loans, consumer loans and operating lease equipment. CIT Bank's operating lease portfolio consists primarily of leased railcars and related equipment.
 At year-end, CIT Bank remained well capitalized, maintaining capital ratios above required levels.
 See discussion in Item 8, Note 29 — Subsequent Events, regarding the acquisition of MOB.
 INFORMATION SECURITY
 Information security, including cybersecurity, is a high priority for CIT. Recent highly publicized events have highlighted the importance of cybersecurity, including cyberattacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies and other organizations that resulted in the compromise of personal and/or confidential information, the theft or destruction of corporate information, and demands for ransom payments to release corporate information encrypted by so-called “ransomware.” A successful cyberattack could harm CIT’s reputation and/or impair its ability to provide services to its customers.
 CIT has developed policies and technology designed to (i) protect both our own and our clients’ information from cyberattacks or other corruption or loss, (ii) reasonably assure the continuity of CIT’s business in the event of disruptions of CIT’s or its vendors’ critical systems, and (iii) comply with regulatory requirements relating to the protection of customer information (see Regulation – Privacy Provisions and Customer and Client Information below). For additional information on CIT’s cybersecurity and business continuity programs, see the Risk Management section of the MD&A below. 
 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 At December 31, 2019, there were no assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. Discontinued operations are discussed in Note 2 — Discontinued Operations in Item 8.
 
EMPLOYEES
 CIT employed 3,609 people at December 31, 2019. Based upon the location of the Company's legal entities, as of December 31, 2019, 3,572 were employed in U.S. entities and 37 in non-U.S. entities.
COMPETITION
 We operate in highly competitive markets. Our competitors include global and regional commercial banks and community banks, as well as captive finance companies, leasing companies, business development companies, and other non-bank lenders. In most of our business lines, we have a few large competitors that have significant market share and many smaller niche competitors. Many of our competitors have substantial financial, technological, and marketing resources.

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


Our customer value proposition is primarily based on financing terms, industry expertise, transaction structuring, technology driven solutions, and client service. From time to time, due to highly competitive markets, we may (i) lose market share if we are unwilling to match product structure, pricing, or terms of our competitors that do not meet our credit standards or return requirements or (ii) receive lower returns or incur higher credit losses if we match our competitors’ product structure, pricing, or terms. We tend not to compete on price, but rather on industry experience, asset and equipment knowledge, and customer service.
REGULATION
 We are regulated pursuant to U.S. federal banking laws, regulations and policies. Such laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers and the federal Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), as well as to minimize risk to the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of our shareholders or non-depository creditors. Bank regulatory agencies have broad examination and enforcement power over BHCs and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions, and require divestitures. BHCs and banks, as well as subsidiaries of both, are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound. CIT is a BHC and elected to be treated as an FHC, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). CIT Bank is chartered as a national bank by the OCC and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. CIT and CIT Bank are subject to certain limitations on our activities, transactions with affiliates, and payment of dividends, and certain standards for capital and liquidity, safety and soundness, and incentive compensation, among other matters. The principal regulator of CIT and its non-bank subsidiaries is the FRB and the principal regulator of CIT Bank and its subsidiaries is the OCC. Both CIT and CIT Bank are subject to the jurisdiction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
 Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of other governmental agencies and self-regulated organizations. CIT Capital Securities LLC is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), a self-regulated organization. CIT Asset Management LLC is a registered investment adviser subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC. Our insurance operations are primarily conducted through The Equipment Insurance Company and CIT Insurance Agency, Inc. Each company is licensed to enter into insurance contracts and is subject to regulation and examination by state insurance regulators.
 In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was signed into law. Among other changes, the EGRRCPA amended provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) to increase the threshold for applicability of the enhanced prudential standards for BHCs from $50 billion to $250 billion. The EGRRCPA’s increased threshold took effect immediately for BHCs with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion, including CIT. As a result, certain of the enhanced prudential standards required under Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act are not applicable to CIT.
 Banking Supervision and Regulation
 Permissible Activities
 As a BHC, CIT may engage in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, performing servicing activities for subsidiaries, and engaging in activities that the FRB has determined, by order or regulation, are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. As an FHC, CIT may also may engage in or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature as long as the FHC continues to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs, including that the FHC and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.”
 A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well-capitalized” if it satisfies the requirements discussed below under “Prompt Corrective Action.” A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well-managed” if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination. If an FHC ceases to be well-capitalized and well-managed, the FHC must enter into a non-public confidential agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the FHC returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any new non-banking financial activities permissible for FHCs or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not timely return to compliance, the FRB may require divestiture of the FHCs depository institutions. BHCs and banks must also be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state. An FHC will also be limited in its ability to commence non-banking financial activities or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities if any of its insured depository institution subsidiaries fails to maintain a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as described below under “Community Reinvestment Act.”
 Activities that are “financial in nature” include securities underwriting, dealing and market making, advising mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. “Complementary activities” are activities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness issue. CIT is primarily engaged in activities that are permissible for a BHC, and conducts only limited business involving the expanded activities available to an FHC.

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


Capital Requirements
 The Company and the Bank are subject to risk-based requirements and rules issued by the FRB, OCC, and FDIC (the “Basel III Rules”) that are based upon the final framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) for strengthening capital and liquidity regulation. Under the Basel III Rules, the Company and the Bank apply the Standardized Approach in measuring their risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and regulatory capital. 
 Under the Basel III Rules, the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum capital ratios for common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The Basel III Rules also include a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, composed entirely of CET1 capital, in addition to the minimum capital to RWA ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to RWA above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s "eligible retained income" (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income).
 As of January 1, 2020, CIT is required to maintain the following risk-based capital ratios:
  
 | Minimum Capital Requirements — January 1, 2020
 | CET 1 | | Tier 1 Capital | | Total Capital
Stated minimum ratios | 4.5 | % | | 6.0 | % | 8.0 | %
Capital conservation buffer | 2.5 | % | | 2.5 | % | 2.5 | %
Effective minimum ratios | 7.0 | % | | 8.5 | % | 10.5 | %

 The Company and CIT Bank meet all capital requirements under the Basel III Rules, including the capital conservation buffer. The table in the MD&A (Regulatory Capital section) presents CIT's and CIT Bank's capital ratios.
 The Company and CIT Bank are also required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to a quarterly average of non-risk weighted total assets) of 4%. The Company and CIT Bank are not subject to the Basel III Rules’ countercyclical buffer or the supplementary leverage ratio.
 The Basel III Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, goodwill, other intangible assets, and deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards net of any related valuation allowance. Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”), DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and investments in non-consolidated financial institutions must also be deducted from CET1 to the extent that they exceed certain thresholds. In November 2017, the federal bank regulators revised the Basel III Rules to extend the transitional treatment of certain DTAs, MSRs, investments in non-consolidated financial institutions and minority interests for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, until April 1, 2020, when the revisions to simplify the regulatory capital treatment of those items take effect.
 The Company and CIT Bank, as non-advanced approaches banking organizations, made a one-time, permanent election under the Basel III Rules to exclude the effects of certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) included in shareholders’ equity under U.S. GAAP (for example, mark-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio) in determining regulatory capital ratios. 
 Under the Basel III Rules, certain off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are converted into RWA, that, together with on-balance sheet assets, are the base against which regulatory capital is measured. The Basel III Rule defined the risk-weighting categories for BHCs and banks that follow the Standardized Approach based on a risk-sensitive analysis, depending on the nature of the exposure. Risk weights range from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to as high as 1,250% for such exposures as certain tranches of securitizations or unsettled security/commodity transactions. In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a rule revising the scope of commercial real estate mortgages subject to a 150% risk weight.
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee's Standardized Approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company or CIT Bank. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and CIT Bank will depend on whether, and the manner in which, it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
 Current Expected Credit Losses Transitional Provisions
 In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which revises the methodology for estimating credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


cost (including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities), net investments in finance leases, available for sale debt securities and unfunded loan commitments. Under this guidance, the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model is based on lifetime expected credit losses, rather than incurred losses, and requires the recognition of these lifetime losses in the allowance for credit losses, or other liabilities for unfunded loan commitments, on the balance sheet at the time of origination or purchase. The Company has adopted this new guidance, effective as of January 1, 2020.
 In December 2018, the federal bank regulators issued a final rule to allow financial institutions to phase in the day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-13. A financial institution that elects to phase in the day-one adverse effects of CECL adoption will phase in the impact to its regulatory capital calculations over a three-year period beginning on the first day of the fiscal year in which the financial institution adopts CECL. The Company has elected to phase in the regulatory capital impact over the allowable three years. See Note 1 - Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8 for additional information on this accounting pronouncement.
 Regulatory Expectations for Capital Planning
 Under Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the EGRRCPA, the FRB has promulgated regulations and issued guidance imposing enhanced prudential supervision requirements on BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more. As a BHC with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion, CIT is not subject to these enhanced prudential standards, including capital planning and stress testing requirements under the FRB’s “Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review” (“CCAR”) process. However, the FRB has indicated that the capital planning and risk management practices of financial institutions with assets of less than $100 billion will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process.
 CIT is required to maintain a comprehensive and effective capital planning process in accordance with SR Letter 09-4, “Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions, and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies” (“SR 09-4”). Under SR 09-4, a BHC is expected to inform and consult with the FRB before (i) declaring and paying a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns, (ii) redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the BHC is experiencing financial weakness, or (iii) redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such instrument during the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. BHCs are expected to advise the FRB sufficiently in advance of such capital action to provide reasonable opportunity for supervisory review and possible objection. The FRB reviews our capital planning process as part of its regular supervisory process.  
 In July 2019, the FRB eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the capital rules for repurchase or redemption of common stock. In certain circumstances, CIT’s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under the regulations or policies of the FRB. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to prior supervisory approval.
 Liquidity Requirements
 In line with international liquidity standards established by the Basel Committee to ensure that banking entities address both short-term and long-term funding needs, the federal banking agencies set minimum liquidity requirements for large banking organizations, including minimum levels of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets. In 2014, the federal banking regulators adopted a joint final rule implementing a liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), calculated as the ratio of a banking entity’s high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over 30 consecutive calendar days, for large and internationally active U.S. banking entities. The final rule applied a modified version of the LCR requirements to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of greater than $50 billion but less than $250 billion. 
 On July 6, 2018, following approval of the EGRRCPA, the FRB issued a statement to provide guidance on how it would administer certain regulations and reporting requirements that the EGRRCPA immediately affected. Among other actions, the FRB stated that it would not require bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets to comply with the LCR requirements. In October 2019, the federal bank regulators issued final rules under the EGRRCPA for tailoring the criteria for determining the applicability of capital and liquidity requirements for large U.S. banking organizations (the “Tailoring Rules”). Under the Tailoring Rules, banking organizations with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Company, are not subject to the LCR.
 Nevertheless, the federal bank regulators have indicated that the capital planning and risk management practices of financial institutions with assets of less than $100 billion will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. The Company and CIT Bank intend to maintain a liquidity risk management and monitoring process designed to ensure appropriate liquidity to meet expected and contingent funding needs under both normal and stress environments, subject to the regular supervisory review process. See “MD&A – Risk Management – Liquidity Risk”.
 Acquisitions
 Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or BHCs. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for (i) the acquisition by a BHC of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of a bank, savings association, or BHC, (ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings association by any subsidiary of a BHC other than a bank, or (iii) the merger 
 8
 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


or consolidation of any BHC with another BHC. Prior regulatory approval is also generally required for mergers, acquisitions and consolidations involving other insured depository institutions. In reviewing acquisition and merger applications, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect of the transaction, financial and managerial issues, including the capital position of the combined organization, convenience and needs factors, including the applicant's CRA record, the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities, and the transaction's effect on the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In addition, a FHC must obtain prior approval of the FRB before acquiring certain non-bank financial companies with assets exceeding $10 billion.
Dividends
 CIT Group Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from CIT Bank and CIT’s other subsidiaries. Its primary sources of cash are interest on intercompany loans to its subsidiaries and dividends from its subsidiaries.
 It is the policy of the FRB that a BHC generally pay dividends on common stock out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year, and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, and the BHC is not in danger of failing to meet its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. A BHC should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure on the capital of bank subsidiaries, or that may undermine the BHC’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank.
 The ability of CIT to pay dividends on common stock may be affected by various factors, including regulatory capital requirements. Capital and non-capital standards established for depository institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, as amended (“FDICIA”) may limit the ability of CIT Bank to pay dividends to CIT. The right of CIT, its stockholders, and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries is further subject to prior claims of creditors of CIT Bank and CIT’s other subsidiaries.
 OCC regulations limit CIT Bank’s ability to pay dividends if the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred) declared in any current year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the total net income for the current year to date plus any retained net income for the prior two years, less the sum of any transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to fund the retirement of any preferred stock. If a dividend in either of the prior two years exceeded that year’s net income, the excess will not reduce the net income for the three-year period described above, provided the amount of excess dividends for either of the prior two years can be offset by retained net income in the current year minus three years or the current year minus four years.
 Volcker Rule
 Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule,” prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds and other private funds that are offered within specified exemptions to the Investment Company Act, known as “covered funds,” subject to certain exemptions. In August 2019, the OCC and the FDIC approved revisions to the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule (the “2019 Final Rule”), effective January 1, 2020, with mandatory compliance by January 1, 2021. The FRB, SEC, and CFTC are also expected to approve the revisions. The revisions implement the compliance programs requirements based on the trading size of an institution’s trading operations, which builds on the relief granted by the EGRRCPA.
 The 2019 Final Rule established three tiers of banking entities, based on the dollar amount of trading assets and liabilities (excluding obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or its agencies and certain U.S. government owned or sponsored enterprises). Each banking entity must establish its compliance program based on whether it has significant trading assets and liabilities ($20 billion or more), moderate trading assets and liabilities ($1 billion or more but less than $20 billion), or limited trading assets and liabilities (less than $1 billion). Banking entities with limited trading assets and liabilities, such as CIT, have a rebuttable presumption of reliance, are not subject to CEO attestation requirements, and may implement the prohibitions and other requirements of the permitted trading activity into their existing internal policies and procedures.
 In January 2020, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC (the “Volcker Rule regulators”) issued a proposal to clarify and amend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions with respect to covered funds. The ultimate impact of any amendments to the Volcker Rule regulations will depend on, among other things, further rulemaking and implementation guidance from the Volcker Rule regulators.
 Orderly Liquidation Authority
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority ("OLA"), a resolution regime for systemically important non-bank financial companies, including BHCs and their non-bank affiliates, under which the FDIC may be appointed receiver to liquidate such a company upon a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury (Treasury), after consultation with the President of the United States, with support by a supermajority recommendation from the FRB and, depending on the type of entity, the approval of the director of the Federal Insurance Office, a supermajority vote of the SEC, or a supermajority vote of the FDIC, that the company is in danger of default, that such default presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability, and that the company should be subject to the OLA process. This resolution authority is similar to the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, with certain modifications to reflect differences between depository institutions and non-bank financial companies and to reduce disparities between the treatment of creditors' claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and in an OLA proceeding compared to those that would exist under the resolution model for insured depository institutions.
 9
 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


An Orderly Liquidation Fund will fund OLA liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the Treasury and risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, any non-bank financial company supervised by the FRB, and certain other financial companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. If an orderly liquidation is triggered, CIT could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund. We do not yet have an indication of the level of such assessments. 
Prompt Corrective Action
 FDICIA, among other things, establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The following table sets forth the required capital ratios to be deemed “well capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” under regulations in effect at December 31, 2019.

 | Prompt Corrective Action Ratios — December 31, 2019
 | Well Capitalized(1) | | Adequately Capitalized
CET 1 | 6.5 | % | | 4.5 | %
Tier 1 Capital | 8.0 | % | | 6.0 | %
Total Capital | 10.0 | % | | 8.0 | %
Tier 1 Leverage(2) | 5.0 | % | | 4.0 | %
(1) A "well capitalized" institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
(2) As a standardized approach banking organization, CIT Bank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective on January 1, 2018. 

 CIT Bank's capital ratios were all in excess of minimum requirements for well capitalized at December 31, 2019.
 FDICIA requires the applicable federal regulatory authorities to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum requirements. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions as the capital category of an institution declines. Undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized depository institutions are required to submit a capital restoration plan to their primary federal regulator. Although prompt corrective action regulations apply only to depository institutions and not to BHCs, the holding company must guarantee any such capital restoration plan in certain circumstances. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank’s assets at the time it became “undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply. The parent holding company might also be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill that guarantee. In the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors.
 Regulators take into consideration both risk-based capital ratios and other factors that can affect a bank's financial condition, including (i) concentrations of credit risk, (ii) interest rate risk, and (iii) risks from non-traditional activities, along with an institution's ability to manage those risks, when determining capital adequacy. This evaluation is made during the institution's safety and soundness examination. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters.
 Brokered Deposits
 An insured depository institution, such as CIT Bank, generally is prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits unless the institution is well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described above, or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the FDIC. In addition, less than well-capitalized banks are subject to restrictions on the interest rates they may pay on deposits. In December 2019, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that is designed to bring the brokered deposits regulations in line with modern deposit taking methods and that may reduce the amount of deposits that would be classified as brokered. The impact on the Bank from any changes to the brokered deposit regulations will depend on the final form of the proposed rule and cannot be predicted at this time.
Source of Strength Doctrine and Support for Subsidiary Banks
 FRB policy and, after the Dodd-Frank Act, the BHC Act requires BHCs such as CIT to serve as a source of strength and to commit capital and other financial resources to subsidiary banks. This support may be required at times when CIT may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations. If CIT is unable to provide such support, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of CIT Bank and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. Any capital loans by a BHC to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank, including intercompany loans from the BHC to its subsidiary banks and senior and subordinated debt securities issued by the subsidiary banks to the BHC. If a BHC commits to a federal bank regulator that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source of strength authority or in 
 10
 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment.
Enforcement Powers of Federal Banking Agencies
 The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have broad enforcement powers with respect to an insured depository institution and its holding company, including the power to (i) impose cease and desist orders, substantial fines and other civil penalties, (ii) terminate deposit insurance, and (iii) appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject CIT or CIT Bank, as well as their officers and directors, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties.
FDIC Deposit Insurance
 Deposits of CIT Bank are insured by the DIF up to $250,000 for each depositor. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions, including CIT Bank.
 The FDIC uses a two scorecard system, one scorecard for most large institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as CIT Bank, and another scorecard for "highly complex" institutions with over $50 billion in assets that are directly or indirectly controlled by a U.S. parent with over $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that is combined to produce a total score, which is translated into an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC utilizes a bank's capital level and CAMELS ratings (a composite regulatory rating based on Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk) and certain financial measures designed to assess an institution's ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score translates to an initial base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply increasing scale. For large institutions, such as CIT Bank, the initial base assessment rate ranges from three to thirty basis points (0.03% – 0.30%) on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from one and a half to forty basis points (0.015% – 0.40%) on an annualized basis. The total base assessment rate is multiplied by the institution’s assessment base, which is the average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, to determine the FDIC assessment fees.
 The FDIC will, at least semi-annually, update its income and loss projections for the DIF and, if necessary, propose rules to further increase assessment rates. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), the FDIC may terminate an institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 Transactions with Affiliates
 Transactions between CIT Bank and its subsidiaries, and CIT and its other subsidiaries and affiliates (“Affiliate Transactions”), are regulated pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB's Regulation W. These laws and regulations limit the types and amounts of Affiliate Transactions, including loans and other extensions of credit. Extensions of credit include credit exposure arising from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and derivative transactions. These laws and regulations also restrict certain other Affiliate Transactions that may otherwise take place, such as the purchase of existing loans or other assets. Affiliate Transactions generally must be on an arms-length basis and, in the case of extensions of credit, be secured by specified amounts and types of collateral. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between CIT Bank and its subsidiaries.
 During 2015, 2016 and 2018 CIT Bank purchased railcars from non-bank subsidiaries of CIT. The aggregate covered value of the railcar transfers to CIT Bank was $809 million at December 31, 2019. Several non-bank subsidiaries of CIT have entered into transactions to sell assets to CIT Bank from time to time. Each of these transactions by CIT Bank with non-bank subsidiaries of CIT constitute transactions with affiliates and are subject to the volume, asset quality, deal terms and other limits set forth in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W. 
 Safety and Soundness Standards
 FDICIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe safety and soundness standards, by regulations or guidelines, as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies have adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material 
 11
 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “Prompt Corrective Action” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution
 If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power:

• | to transfer any of the depository institution's assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution's creditors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to enforce the terms of the depository institution's contracts pursuant to their terms; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities, including the claims of the FDIC as the guarantor of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever seeks to repudiate any debt obligations of CIT Bank, the debt holders would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than CIT Bank's depositors.
 Consumer Protection Regulation
 Retail banking activities are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by national banks are subject to federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to numerous laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, applying to all debts incurred prior to commencement of active military service (including credit card and other open-end debt) and limiting the amount of interest, including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges (other than bona fide insurance) that is related to the obligation or liability, as well as affording other protections, including with respect to foreclosures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, requiring disclosures regarding the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process and governing transfers of servicing, escrow accounts, force-placed insurance, and general servicing policies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such laws.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Deposit operations also are subject to consumer protection laws and regulation, such as:
  
• | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which require disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs electronic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customer' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services, including remittance transfers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CIT and CIT Bank are also subject to certain other non-preempted state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers. Additionally, CIT Bank is subject to a variety of regulatory and contractual obligations imposed by credit owners, insurers and guarantors of the mortgages we originate and service. This includes, but is not limited to, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA"), and the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"). We are also subject to the requirements of the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP") and other government programs in which we participate.

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision ("CFPB")
 The CFPB is authorized to interpret and administer, and to issue orders or guidelines pursuant to, any federal consumer financial laws, as well as to directly examine and enforce compliance with those laws by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as CIT Bank. The CFPB has jurisdiction over CIT, CIT Bank, and other subsidiaries with respect to matters that relate to these laws and consumer financial services and products and periodically conducts examinations.
 The CFPB has adopted a number of significant rules that require banks to, among other things: (a) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” requirement and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage”; (b) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence; and (c) comply with additional rules and restrictions regarding mortgage loan originator compensation and the qualification and registration or licensing of loan originators.
 The CFPB and other federal agencies have also jointly finalized rules imposing credit risk retention requirements on lenders originating certain mortgage loans, which require sponsors of a securitization to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of assets collateralizing asset-backed securities. Residential mortgage-backed securities qualifying as "qualified residential mortgages" will be exempt from the risk retention requirements. The final rule maintains revisions to the proposed rules that cover degrees of flexibility for meeting risk retention requirements and the relationship between "qualified mortgages" and "qualified residential mortgages." These rules and any other new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB could require changes to the Company's mortgage origination business, result in increased compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of such business.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA requires depository institutions like CIT Bank to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) individuals and communities within its assessment area. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for depository institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings, which are made available to the public. In order for a FHC to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the FHC must have received a rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of applications to acquire, merge, or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office, and such record may be the basis for denying the application. CIT Bank received a rating of "Satisfactory" on its most recent published CRA examination by the OCC dated August 6, 2018 and released December 5, 2019.
 In December 2019, the OCC and the FDIC proposed a rule that would seek to expand the types of activities that qualify for CRA credit; revise how banks delineate their CRA assessment areas; and establish new standards for evaluating banks with more than $500 million in assets, including, among others, the number of qualifying retail loan originations to LMI individuals. The impact on CIT Bank from any changes to the CRA regulations will depend on the final form of the proposed rule and how it is implemented and applied.
 On November 1, 2019, as part of the process to acquire MOB, CIT announced a Community Benefits Plan developed in collaboration with the California Reinvestment Coalition (“CRC”) and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (“NCRC”). Through the plan, CIT Bank agreed to $7.75 billion in CRA qualified lending and investments over a four-year term, covering the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023. Of the $7.75 billion commitment, $6.5 billion over the four-year plan period will be within California for statewide CRA lending and investments, with sub-targets for specified small business and mortgage lending. Outside of California, the Bank has committed $1.25 billion over the four-year term in CRA qualified lending and investments to communities where the bank will have physical branches. The Plan sets forth additional goals for supplier diversity, and the addition of a new branch in California, which will serve LMI customers in a neighborhood of color.
 Incentive Compensation
 The federal banking agencies issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act discussed below.
 In 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC proposed rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including CIT and CIT Bank). These rules have not yet been adopted.

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and Economic Sanctions
 In the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, imposes significant obligations on financial institutions, including banks, to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing, including requirements to implement AML programs, verify the identity of customers that maintain accounts, file currency transaction reports, and monitor and report suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Financial institutions are subject to Customer Due Diligence requirements, issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), to identify and verify the identity of natural persons, known as beneficial owners, who own, control, and profit from legal entity customers when those customers open accounts. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. The Company has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the U.S., as well as sanctions based on United Nations and other international mandates.
Anti-corruption
 The Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Company is also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions in which it may do business, which often prohibit commercial bribery, the receipt of a bribe, and the failure to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules, and regulations.
Privacy Provisions and Customer and Client Information
 Certain aspects of the Company’s business are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of customer information, including those adopted pursuant to Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the U.S., and various laws in other jurisdictions in which it may do business. Federal banking regulators, as required under the GLBA, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties, requiring disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allowing consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. Federal financial regulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for cross-selling products and services between those affiliated companies.
 In addition, privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus, and several states have recently enacted consumer privacy laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to personal information. For example, in June 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”). The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including for information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA. In October 2019, the California Attorney General adopted regulations to implement the CCPA. In addition, similar laws have and may be adopted by other states where the Company does business. The impact of the CCPA and other state privacy laws on the Company’s business is yet to be determined.
 Other Regulations
 In addition to U.S. banking regulation, our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by other federal, state, and various foreign governmental authorities. Additionally, our operations may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions. This oversight may serve to:

• | regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements, if any, in various jurisdictions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulate customers' insurance coverages;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | require disclosures to customers;
--+----------------------------------


• | govern secured transactions;
--+-----------------------------


• | set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower's credit experience and other data collection.

 CIT ANNUAL REPORT 2019


Our Aerospace, Rail, Maritime, and other equipment financing operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In the U.S., our equipment financing and leasing operations, including for aircraft, railcars, ships, and other equipment, are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards promulgated by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, the Maritime Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, state agencies regulate some aspects of rail and maritime operations with respect to health and safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law.
 Each of CIT's insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in the states in which it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things: licensing companies and agents to transact business; establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and the solvency standards that must be met and maintained; regulating certain premium rates; reviewing and approving policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements; approving changes in control of insurance companies; restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments. Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities.
 Changes to laws of states and countries in which we do business could affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
 Accretable Yield reflects the excess of cash flows expected to be collected (estimated fair value at acquisition date) over the recorded investment of Purchase Credit Impaired (“PCI”) Loans and Investments and is recognized in interest income using an effective yield method over the expected remaining life. The accretable yield is affected by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, changes in prepayment assumptions and changes in expected principal and interest payments and collateral values. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and related ASUs, on January 1, 2020, the concept of PCI was eliminated, thereby eliminating the concept of Accretable Yield.
