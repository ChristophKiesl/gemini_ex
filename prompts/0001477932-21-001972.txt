Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes," "project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Our Potential Advantages
 
Our brands offer a new take on hemp products. Humbly Hemp snacks are positions to bring hemp into the daily routine of the "everyman". Our branding and market position take the stigma and fear out of hemp, creating an approachable product for anyone to enjoy. ENDO Brands advantage in the market is our unique formulation, price point, high quality. We are one of the first in the CBD industry to have a testable, full spectrum CBD water product. Our in-house formulation allows us to create our proprietary CBD ingredient and infuse our products at a fraction of the cost of other brands.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution Strategies
 
Marketing Plan
 
Multi-Channel Marketing: We promote through multiple channels to build brand awareness for our initial products. 
 
Online Marketing: We tailor an online marketing campaign to attract the two market segments mentioned earlier in the target market segment. This position will assure that we are promoting to the most viable group of consumers. However, most major online platform do not allow the advertising of CBD infused products for sale so we are limited in what we can promote.
Instagram: Our goal on IG for our brands is to build an obsessed fan base and an engaged community. Hemp education is a vital part of these channels, we will utilize this channel to show the “lifestyle” using our products as well as unique info on our products and drive traffic to our stores.
Twitter: We will use Twitter to inform our customers and investors about the company and to drive traffic to our website that will convert into purchases. 
 
Facebook: Facebook has gone from being a publishing channel for brands, to now a landing page of brand identity. We will utilize Facebook as a cornerstone of our online identity. We will be careful about being "too promotional" and we will be aiming for content that people will share. 
Consumer Outreach & Education: The most important factor in the marketing of our products will be consumer education on the benefits of hemp and CBD.

Sales Plan

The ability to get our products into distributors having access to so many retail locations is a big win for our brands.
