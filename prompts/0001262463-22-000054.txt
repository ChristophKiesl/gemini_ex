Item 1. Business
Overview
 Healthtech Solution Inc. (“Healthtech” or the “Company”) is a life sciences company dedicated to building impactful solutions for people and the healthcare system through an innovative portfolio model approach that fosters the maturation of subsidiary companies with products ranging in development from early stage through commercial growth. We are agnostic to the clinical solution because we believe that to accomplish our mission of improving lives that all options should be on the table, including therapeutics, devices, diagnostics, and digital technology. In fact, we hypothesize that some of the most promising breakthroughs will occur at the interface of these traditional silos, which has already begun to occur. Examples include drug delivery innovation combining advanced therapeutics and devices, human-machine interfaces combining medical devices with digital technology, and companion diagnostics that determine the ideal patient candidate for new therapeutics. Healthcare, illness, and injury are multifactorial, and we believe the solutions often need to be multi-pronged to succeed.
 Our business model begins with the identification of target subsidiary companies through our broad network of relationships in academia and industry that continually provide access to new opportunities. Upon thorough due diligence and confirmation of a mutual fit for both Healthtech and the potential portfolio company, we bring the company and/or its technology into a Healthtech subsidiary where we will provide funding and operational support to achieve value enhancing milestones and accelerate the organization’s mission. Upon achieving the targeted value inflection, we will work closely with our subsidiaries to prepare for their independent launch and spin-out. At spin-out, equity is returned in a hybrid structure that results in immediate disbursement of spin-out equity to Healthtech’s shareholders as well as a portion returned to the parent company for re-investment in new opportunities. Through this approach, Healthtech shareholders continually gain exposure to early-stage life science technologies that are approaching the steepest portion of their value creation curve through an investment structure that is devoid of the “carry” typically imposed by a traditional private equity/venture capital fund. Furthermore, we roll up our sleeves and provide significant operational and leadership support to our portfolio companies, increasing their chances of success and decreasing their capital requirements. We believe this multiplies the impact of the funding provided to each subsidiary compared to the traditional passive investing model – and so do our portfolio companies.

Currently, there are three subsidiaries in the Healthtech family: Healthtech Wound Care, Inc. (“HWC”), Medi-Scan Inc. (“MediScan”), and RevHeart Inc. (“RevHeart”). We intend to complete further transactions that will build synergies across the organization, creating a diverse portfolio of assets that still allows us to leverage skillsets and costs amongst our first partners.
 Our Portfolio Subsidiaries
 Healthtech Wound Care, Inc.
 In January 2022, Healthtech Wound Care, Inc. (“HWC”) acquired the assets of Predictive Biotech, Inc. (“PBI”) that were related to PBI’s business of developing novel wound care products for acute and chronic wounds. HWC’s plan is to use those assets as the foundation for HWC’s program of identifying and developing a pipeline of human cell and tissue product (HCT/Ps) candidates that we believe have novel mechanisms of action and immediate clinical potential in accordance with applicable federal regulations.
 Prior to the January 2022 asset sale, PBI had developed AmnioBind, a placental membrane allograft designed to act as a covering or barrier for the protection of burns and non-healing wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. The product is provided in multiple sizes to be applied directly to clean, debrided wounds where bacterial burden and offloading have been addressed. The base material for AmnioBind is collected from live, healthy, births from appropriately screened donors. The collected placental tissue is washed, dehydrated, cut, packaged, and sterilized for commercial distribution. AmnioBind is processed in compliance with US CFR Title 21 Part 1271 and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and regulated as a human cell and tissue product. This regulatory status was confirmed in writing on August 23, 2021, by the Tissue Reference Group of the Food and Drug Administration. PBI applied for and was granted a Q-code (Q-4225, per square cm) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, effective 4/1/2022. A provisional patent covering the manufacturing steps and clinical uses for AmnioBind was filed in September, 2021. The patent filing process is expected to be completed in Q2, 2022.
 As part of the January asset sale, PBI assigned to HWC the right to market AmnioBind for HWC’s own account as well as control over PBI’s own marketing of AmnioBind and other wound care products that may be developed. PBI also assigned to HWC control over the future development of wound care products, whether developed by HWC or PBI.
 Increasing numbers of patients with chronic and acute wounds are resulting in a growing demand for wound care products globally. An estimated 2.5% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and others. As a result, the adoption rate of wound care products, including traditional therapies, bioactive therapies (including skin substitutes and growth factors) and others, is increasing. Technological advancements in bioactive therapies, such as reduction in overall duration and cost of treatment, have further attracted the patient population to these products. The global wound care market is projected to grow from USD 18.51 billion in 2022 to USD 28.23 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period.

Predictive Biotech intends to further elucidate the efficacy mechanism of action of AmnioBind in a clinical study in which AmnioBind (in addition to standard of care) is compared to a commercially available product and standard of care alone. AmnioBind, along with standard of care, is expected to significantly reduce treatment times of patients when compared to standard of care alone.
 
The Wound Care Market and Placental Tissue 
 
Skin conditions, which include but are not limited to wounds, can be devastating to patients. There are an estimated 500,000 burns treated in the United States each year, and globally this statistic increases to 11 million injuries per year. The overall mortality rate for burn injury has been estimated to have been 4.9% between 1998-2007 and medical costs for burn treatments approach $2 billion per year. In addition, chronic wounds constitute a large patient base and healing rates remain below 50%. These non-healing chronic wounds are estimated to affect 7 million people in the United States. Patients who suffer from these skin conditions can benefit from rapid treatments that result in at least partial closure and protection of the wounds.
 
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major health complication that will affect up to 15% of individuals with diabetes mellitus over their lifetime. The treatment of DFUs is an extremely challenging scenario, as these ulcers may be recalcitrant to SOC treatments, thus increasing the risk of infection and sequelae such as amputations. It is estimated that approximately 15% of all DFUs will result in a lower extremity amputation and develop concomitant medical complications that are associated with increased mortality rates.
 
DFUs not only have a detrimental effect on a patient’s quality of life, but also pose a significant burden on healthcare facilities and the public and/or private payers who support these facilities. Waycaster et al. noted a recent economic evaluation of Medicare beneficiaries which concluded that the United States spent $32B USD in 2014 on 8.2 million patients This equates to approximately $4,000 USD per patient.
 Human amniotic membrane has been used in the treatment of wounds since the early 20th century. Numerous potential applications of this tissue have been investigated since then. Studies have demonstrated that amniotic membranes have anti-inflammatory effects, are antimicrobial, demonstrate anti-scarring, maintain an anti-adhesive activity, are non-immunogenic with low antigenicity, have analgesic properties, and promote re- epithelialization. One noted application is for use in patients with DFUs. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Laurent et al. concluded that “[h]uman amnion/chorion membrane + standard of care treatment heals DFUs significantly faster than standard of care alone.”

Facilities for Wound Care Operations
 
PBI’s laboratory facility is register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a Human Cell and Tissue Establishment, FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI): 3012707547. The facility includes two (2) ISO Class 7 cleanrooms containing twelve (12) ISO Class 5 Biological Safety Cabinets. The equipment and facilities are inspected and validated semiannually by independent contractors to ensure that all are functioning correctly. PBI’s facility conforms to current Good Tissue Practices (21 CFR 1271.150), current Good Manufacturing Practices and is ISO 13485 certified. These facilities will be used in manufacturing AmnioBind and other products for commercial use and for experimental use in Investigational New Drug Applications. Since the sale of assets in January 2022, the lab facility has operated under the direction of HWC.
 
MediScan, Inc.
 MediScan is a company developing advanced ultrasound imaging and artificial intelligence (“AI”) based image analysis software. Within the past few years, medical professionals have realized the wide-spread versatility of handheld ultrasound devices. Point-of-care ultrasound (“POCUS”) and handheld systems now represent a rapidly growing portion of sales of ultrasound technology in the United States and worldwide. Ultrasound devices with the AI-based software applications MediScan is developing have the potential to enable healthcare professionals to more efficiently triage and prioritize workflows due to enhanced visualization and/or computer-assisted analysis of suspected findings.
 MediScan is developing its AI-based software for analysis of ultrasound images of the chest (primarily lung) and musculoskeletal (“MSK”) system. The software is being trained with validated ultrasound images using AI algorithms. Once sufficiently trained for each targeted disease or injury pattern, we expect that the AI-based software will be capable of analyzing images and studies for suspected diseases or injuries to assist with triage and prioritization in point-of-care settings. These systems will not alter the images and will not be intended to be used as a diagnostic device, at least initially. As training of each system is completed, resulting in proof-of-concept data, MediScan will define and design the necessary validation studies to pursue regulatory clearance for each application, while continuing to enhance the capabilities within each organ or tissue system. In addition to the lead development programs focused on chest and MSK ultrasound software analysis, we are evaluating other organ systems, disease states, or tissues that could benefit from a similar point-of-care (“POC”) solution based on unmet needs and workflow challenges with current solutions. In parallel, we are developing a cloud-based software system capable of converting two-dimensional analog grayscale ultrasound images into a digital three-dimensional high-definition color format with the goal of expanding the visual image available to the healthcare provider (“HCP”).
 MediScan has filed two provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office listed below, and through its ongoing research efforts, MediScan expects to develop additional technology and application methods of strategic value to the Company, for which it may seek patent protection.

We intend to market our imaging technology through the Software as a Service ("SaaS") model. SaaS is a business model where the software system is held in the cloud and accessed by a local computer, tablet or smartphone via the internet. The healthcare industry is adopting the SaaS model for clinical information systems (such as PACS, EHR, telehealth applications, treatment planning software) and nonclinical information systems (such as billing, revenue cycle management, and supply chain management).
 Understanding that not every healthcare system and practice has adopted widespread use of the SaaS model, we are further attracted to POCUS solutions, which have less barriers to entry to facilitate for SaaS models compared to the traditional imaging solutions that are contained within large hospital systems and imaging centers, that may be reluctant to on-board numerous single algorithms that are now gaining FDA clearance. The Canadian Association of Radiologists highlighted this sentiment stating, “Ultimately, the driver of clinical adoption may reside in the implementation and availability of AI applications integrated into the PACS system at the reading station.” Within the last three years since that white paper was written, the field of AI in medicine has accelerated, now with numerous AI-based software assistants cleared by the FDA, and new solutions to large scale integration blossoming in the form of medical AI algorithm marketplaces. AI marketplaces and larger multimodal AI infrastructure have the potential to accelerate the adoption of AI in medicine by creating a model that mirrors “app stores” - algorithms that provide the greatest value can compete.
 We believe the market opportunity for AI-based medical image analysis is large, that it will grow rapidly over the next ten years, and that regulatory and industry solutions are now developed to the point of making the commercialization and adoption of medical AI-based software feasible. In regard to the handheld POCUS probes and devices alone, the global portable ultrasound market size is projected to reach $3.9 billion in 2026, according to Fortune Business Insights. The market stood at $1.8 billion in sales in 2019 with a projected CAGR of 13.6% from 2020 to 2026. North America accounted for $733 million in sales in 2019 and is expected to remain the market leader.
 The global ultrasound image analysis software market, separate from the POCUS hardware market described above, is projected to reach between $2.9 and $4.5 billion by 2025. Both markets are expected to synergistically drive each other, with increasing adoption of POCUS hardware due to AI image analysis reducing expertise to perform POCUS. Furthermore, these projections may already be underestimating the adoption of POCUS devices due to the acceleration of use throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, where POC solutions that limited patient movement and provided information allowing for rapid triage became necessities.
 Within the last three years, numerous AI-based software assistants have been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). New solutions to large scale integration of these narrowly focused algorithms are becoming available as “medical AI algorithm marketplaces”. These marketplaces may be able to aggregate the growing number of algorithms, and seamlessly integrate them into radiologists’ or healthcare systems’ workflows. The currently available medical AI algorithm marketplaces and more advanced infrastructure solutions being designed by large companies could lower the barriers to entry for new products with highly focused niche applications.

RevHeart, Inc.
 RevHeart is a discovery stage company focused on novel approaches to correct cardiac rhythm abnormalities using electromagnetic waveforms in an innovative approach called entrainment, building from advances gained in other disease states. Entrainment, which is currently used in tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), works by linking the patient’s abnormal heart rhythm together with a normal heart rhythm, and gently encouraging the abnormal rhythm to revert to a more normal rhythm. As part of these efforts, RevHeart is developing software technology that compares a healthy heart rhythm electronic signal with a damaged heart’s signal, and subsequently derives an electronic signal representing the potentially curative waveform. Then, through a monitored feed-back mechanism, the curative electronic signal would be introduced to the patient to achieve a reversion to the healthy heart rhythm. RevHeart plans to develop the software and prototype of the device capable of testing the hypothesis that entrainment can convert abnormal electrocardiogram (“ECG”) waveforms into normal ECG waveforms through iterative corrective signals.
 RevHeart has filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office listed below, and through its ongoing research efforts, RevHeart expects to develop additional technology and application methods of strategic value to the Company, for which it may seek patent protection.

All cardiac rhythm abnormalities could potentially benefit from the RevHeart device and entrainment, such as atrial fibrillation (“AFib”) and conduction system diseases. AFib is projected to affect between 6 and 12 million people in the United States by 2050. According to Markets and Markets, the cardiac monitoring and rhythm management devices market is projected to reach $26. billion worldwide by 2025 with a projected CAGR of 4.0% from 2020 to 2025, with the United States occupying the largest share of the market.
 
Our Portfolio Investment
 
As noted above, our business plan contemplates that we will acquire Portfolio Subsidiaries in their early stages of development, nurture them until they are market-ready, then transfer our control via spin-out or otherwise, while retaining a minority interest in the newly-independent company as a Portfolio Investment. At present, we hold one Portfolio Investment, a 5.5% interest in the equity of Varian Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Varian”),
Varian Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Varian is an emerging biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, targeted oncology therapies with transformational potential for cancer patients. Varian’s strategy is to identify, license and develop a pipeline of therapeutic candidates that they believe have novel mechanisms of action and transformative clinical potential, and then to bring the requisite scientific and clinical resources together to move them forward in the promise of safer and more effective cancer treatments.

Varian is developing VAR-101/102, a high-potency, specific, atypical Protein Kinase C iota (“aPKCi”) inhibitor in two formulations. Recently, numerous scientific publications have identified aPKCi as an oncogene, whose presence and activation has been implicated in the development and growth of multiple forms of human cancer including basal cell carcinoma (“BCC”), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”), pancreatic, non-small cell lung cancel (“NSCLC”), acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and others. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in VAR-101/102, an aPKCi inhibitor, has demonstrated dose dependent anti-tumor activity in murine and human BCC cell lines, as well as other cancer models. Varian intends to develop VAR-101 in a topical formulation for BCC which has the potential to offer optimal clinical utility in BCC as a surgical neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. VAR-102, an oral formulation of the active aPKCi inhibitor, lends itself to broader applications in multiple tumor types. Varian believes that VAR-101 and VAR-102, if approved, could represent significant medical and commercial opportunities. Varian has agreements in place with contract manufacturers and research organizations, and consulting groups, for API synthesis, formulation and non-clinical studies to progress the development of VAR-101 and VAR-102 in IND enabling activities.
 In May 2021 Healthtech Solutions acquired all of the equity in Varian. Between May 2021 and November 2021, Healthtech Solutions contributed approximately $900,000 to fund the ongoing operations of Varian, while Healthtech management and the Varian management team jointly pursued the financing that Varian requires to become market-ready. In November 2021, the parties agreed to sever the relationship: Healthtech Solutions returned 94.5% of the equity in Varian to its original owners. Healthtech Solutions now holds the remaining 5.5% equity interest in Varian as its initial Portfolio Investment.
 
Regulatory Requirements
 HWC’s AmnioBind product has received all necessary regulatory clearance to be marketed for wound care indications. MediScan’s imaging APP, therefore, is the only product in our portfolio at this time for which regulatory approval will be required. The following discussion, therefore, focuses on the regulations that will be applicable to the imaging APP. As we expand our portfolio, however, other aspects of federal and state regulation of products for medical application will become relevant.
FDA Medical Device Regulation
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States, as well as medical devices manufactured in the United States and exported to international markets. Medical devices must be shown to be safe and effective for their intended use, and data demonstrating safety and effectiveness that is provided to the FDA must be adequate to enable the agency to make regulatory decisions related to marketing approval.
 Under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), the FDA classifies each medical device into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. Class I medical devices are deemed to pose the lowest risk to the patient. We anticipate that MediScan’s imaging APP will be reviewed as a Class I device since it consists of software and there are no patient-facing components (i.e. nothing touches the patient and there is no energy transfer to the patient). In addition, our imaging APP is not completely novel, and there are legally marketed devices that can be used as predicate devices. The safety and efficacy of our imaging APP can be assured through the use of general and special controls, and the technology used is sufficiently similar that risks and benefits of the technology can be evaluated using prior knowledge.

We anticipate that the FDA will require primarily software-based testing, which will compare the accuracy and consistency of clinical interpretations using the product versus interpretations using an alternative imaging modality, with limited requirements for clinical testing. It will be necessary to provide data related to software validation and verification. From the perspective of FDA, software validation and verification are required under the Quality System Regulations. Validation determines if the product works as intended for the end user; verification confirms that the software, as coded, functions properly. Software validation establishes, using objective evidence, that the device specifications conform with user needs and intended uses, and is demonstrated by identifying user needs and testing against those needs to ensure that the product requirements and software specifications result in a software product that meets those needs. Validation testing is typically conducted through use cases or clinical testing.
 Verification testing confirms that the output of the software matches inputs and confirms using objective evidence that the specified requirements have been fulfilled. Accurate and detailed product requirements and design specifications are necessary to permit efficient verification testing. Testing should confirm that the product both performs as intended, and in the way anticipated. Verification testing will also include verification of adequate design for purposes of assuring the cybersecurity of the device.
 Class I medical devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny and need only comply with the FDA’s General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality Systems Regulations, or QSR, as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions. Unless specifically exempted in the regulations, General Controls require most companies that intend to market a Class I medical device, such as our imaging APP, to gain clearance for marketing through the 510(k) process.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for MediScan’s imaging APP, we will be required to submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed medical device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a previously cleared medical device used for the same indications. Typically, data must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating similar technology and clinical and non- clinical performance, electromagnetic compatibility, software validation, and when appropriate, biocompatibility characteristics. FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months. On average the review time is approximately six months, but it can take significantly longer than twelve months in some instances, as the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 We anticipate that a separate 510(k) clearance will be required for each usage class for which we market our imaging APP - i.e. an application for lung scans, an application for heart scans, an application for tendon scans, etc. However, each application will build on what was demonstrated in prior applications, and so the time and expense required will reduce as we gain a body of approvals.

After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) notice, or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the FDA may levy significant regulatory fines or penalties on the manufacturer.
 Any of the devices that we are developing for use in treatment of cardiomyopathy will be classified as Class III devices, which are those devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared medical device. Class III medical devices require a Pre-Market Approval ("PMA") before commercialization. This is the most stringent regulatory review and requires substantial development of clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before the FDA permits the device to be marketed. The Filing Fee payable to the FDA for a PMA is $365,657; the Small Business Fee is $91,414 (as compared to $12,432 and $3,108 for submission of a 510(k) application). In addition, to the extent that we are seeking approval for a medical diagnostic or therapeutic product that would be classified as biologic or pharmaceutical product, FDA guidelines will require that we partner with an FDA-approved biological or pharmaceutical company to perform the requisite studies. Such a partnering arrangement may require that we license our technology to the partner for regulatory and marketing purposes.
 It is important to note that, because the FDA’s determination is based on its evaluation of the data and regulatory decision-making regarding safety, effectiveness and compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements, approval of a marketing application is not assured.
 Healthcare Regulation in General
 Our future business operations and activities in the U.S. may be directly or indirectly subject to certain federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information, and state and federal laws designed to guard against healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, those described below.

11
--


● | HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, established comprehensive requirements related to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. It governs patient privacy practices of healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses (or “covered entities”), as well as their respective business associates to the extent that they perform services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. HIPAA also mandates notification in the event of a breach and regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions. Covered entities and business associates may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, as well as enforcement by state attorneys general, for violations of HIPAA or its implementing regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HIPAA also imposes federal criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. 
● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
● | The federal Civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government, alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. 
● | The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 
● | Analogous state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid, other state programs, or, in some states, private third-party payors. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. These state laws, which may be even more stringent than the HIPAA requirements, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and are often not preempted by the federal requirements.

These and other regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. We will also be subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), will monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.
 We plan to gain access for our products to the E.U. market. In the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements (EU MDR). Implementation of the new requirements is scheduled to commence in May 2021.
 The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to obtain approvals for our products.
