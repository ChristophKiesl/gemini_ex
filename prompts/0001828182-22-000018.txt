Item 1. Business.
Overview
Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading healthcare platform that leverages advanced analytics, technology, and nationwide healthcare provider networks to create and power value-based payment programs. Our mission is to transform how care is paid for and delivered so that people can enjoy more healthy, happy days at home. By activating the home as a key part of the care continuum, we are helping lessen dependence on facility-centric care, preventing costly adverse events and facilitating holistic condition management across settings of care. Our customers include health plans, governments, employers, health systems and physician groups. We believe that we are a market leader in two fast-growing segments of the value-based healthcare payment industry: payment models based on individual episodes of care and in-home health evaluations (“IHEs”). Payment models based on individual episodes of care organize or bundle payments for all, or a substantial portion of, services received by a patient in connection with an episode of care, such as a surgical procedure, particular condition or other reason for a hospital stay. IHEs are health evaluations performed by a clinician in the home to support payors’ participation in Medicare Advantage and other government-run managed care plans. Our episode payment platform managed $4.62 billion of spend under the Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI-A”) program in 2021. Our mobile network of providers conducted over 1.9 million IHEs for individuals participating in Medicare Advantage and other managed care plans in 2021. We believe that these core businesses have enabled us to become integral to how health plans and healthcare providers successfully participate in value-based payment programs, and that our platform lessens the dependence on facility-centric care for acute and post-acute services and shifts more services towards alternate sites and, most importantly, the home.
Value-based payment programs are rapidly transforming how governments, employers, and health plans pay for and manage healthcare services. The objective of these initiatives is to improve patient outcomes while lowering the overall cost of healthcare services. We believe that our differentiated data assets, proprietary analytics capabilities, comprehensive cloud-based software platforms, and healthcare provider networks enable success in the two dominant forms of value-based payments: population-based payment programs and episode-based payment programs. Medicare Advantage is one of the largest population-based payment initiatives and the Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (“BPCI”) initiative is one of the largest episode-based payment programs. We have leading positions serving both of these fast-growing sectors, as measured by our volume of IHEs and the program size of our episodes business, respectively.
Our solutions support value-based payment programs by aligning financial incentives around outcomes, providing tools to health plans and healthcare organizations designed to assess and manage risk and identify actionable opportunities for improved patient outcomes, coordination and cost-savings. Through our platform, we coordinate what we believe is a holistic suite of clinical, social, and behavioral services to address an individual’s healthcare needs and prevent adverse events that drive excess cost. Our business model is aligned with our customers as we generate revenue only when we successfully engage members for our health plan customers and generate savings for our provider customers.
We have two operating segments: Home & Community Services and Episodes of Care Services. We serve 46 Medicare Advantage health plans ranging from the largest national organizations to smaller regional and provider-owned entities. We also serve thousands of healthcare provider organizations ranging from large integrated delivery systems to midsize and small urban and rural entities. 
Our Solutions
Home & Community Services
In our Home & Community Services segment, we offer a variety of solutions to help manage the health of our customers’ members in their homes.
In-home health evaluations and related services
We believe we have the largest mobile network of credentialed providers in the United States, which we deploy into the home primarily to conduct IHEs and to perform select diagnostic services. Through our IHEs, we create a comprehensive, documented record of the clinical, social, and behavioral needs of our health plan customers’ medically complex populations and seek to further engage them with the healthcare system. Working with data from our health plan customers, our operating platform and advanced data analytics seek to identify the highest priority individuals for an in-home evaluation. We then engage with those members to schedule visits to perform IHEs. While in the home, our providers perform IHEs with the assistance of our longitudinal patient records and our proprietary clinical workflow software with its integrated device hub. Our software guides clinical workflows as well as in-home diagnostic screenings, yielding a rich patient report of approximately 240 data points. The duration of our IHEs is up to 2.5 times longer than the average visit with a primary care physician (“PCP”). While performing these evaluations, we also seek to engage individuals more closely with the healthcare system. For example, the evaluation results of IHEs are provided to individuals’ PCPs. We believe sharing these results helps to fill gaps in care, while encouraging individuals who do not regularly visit their PCP to schedule a visit.
In addition to providing health plans with insights into member health without taking members out of the home, the reports our IHEs produce form the basis of the Medicare Risk Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) scores, which are required for health plans to effectively participate in value-based and risk-adjusted government programs like Medicare Advantage and affect the premiums health plans receive for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. The data we gather is used by health plans to improve their Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) scores and Medicare Advantage Star Ratings (“Star Ratings”). We conducted over 1.9 million IHEs (including virtual IHEs) in the year ended December 31, 2021.
Telehealth through virtual IHEs
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in close coordination with our customers, we accelerated our telehealth initiatives by launching virtual IHEs (“vIHEs”) in the second quarter of 2020. vIHEs primarily take place via videoconference. vIHEs have allowed us to engage with high-need, vulnerable individuals during a critical time, ensuring that our health plan customers maintain detailed insights into their members’ health and are able to coordinate services accordingly. Leveraging our technology and engagement tools, our staff and clinical network successfully completed more than 0.5 million vIHEs, or 38% of total IHEs completed in 2020, using a combination of audio and video connectivity in 2020. Although, the volume of vIHEs declined in 2021 compared to 2020, we continued conducting vIHEs throughout 2021 and approximately 17% of total IHEs completed in 2021 were virtual in response to the dynamic COVID-19 pandemic and to meet the changing needs of our clients.
Social determinants of health
We bring community-based organizations (“CBOs”) together into outcomes-focused networks that are designed to address social determinants of health (“SDOH”). In 2019, we started utilizing telephonic outreach and comprehensive, in-home evaluations to directly identify the social determinants of an individual’s health, such as food insecurity, slip and fall risk, access to transportation, social isolation, and the financial resources to afford 
medications. For certain customers, we combine this assessment with IHEs and refer to this combined product as an IHE+. Beginning in 2020, we began referring individuals directly to CBOs in our network leveraging our platform as a system of record for referral workflow and data capture. For our health plan customers, we believe this feature adds an advanced SDOH component to an already high-value IHE product and helps us to drive increased member engagement.
Episodes of Care Services
In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we develop provider networks, build software and deliver services that support the organization and financing of healthcare around a patient’s episode of care. Our customers include the payors offering episode of care programs, as well as the providers who participate in such programs when delivering healthcare services.
We operate a large episode-based program, with $4.62 billion of spend under management in 2021. Our programs, platforms and networks drive care redesign to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. We believe we accomplish these goals by reducing variations in care delivery, identifying cost saving opportunities and propelling recovery homeward. In so doing, we help to improve the coordination of care among clinicians, facilities and individuals along the care continuum. For example, the BPCI-A episodes we managed which were initiated in the last quarter of 2020 resulted in approximately 15% greater discharges home (including home health) from acute-care facilities and approximately 10% lower readmissions when compared to the historical performance of our provider partners for similar episodes. In 2021 and 2020, we generated savings of approximately $260 million and $381 million, respectively, while seeking also to improve key measures of patient outcomes. The year-over-year decrease in savings was primarily due to the negative impact of COVID-19. 
The complexity and risk associated with episode of care programs leads payors and healthcare providers to seek expertise in the many disciplines required to achieve success in these programs. Our episodes of care capabilities include:
•We own libraries of episode definitions and also work with open source versions of episode definitions to implement and develop clinical episodes. We are able to implement surgical or medical episodes, such as those for knee replacements, colonoscopies, pregnancy and newborn deliveries, as well as condition-centric episodes, including those addressing chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, and behavioral health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse disorders. 
•We have data analytics capabilities that enable us to analyze payment data from multiple sources in order to provide payors and providers with information about clinical episode initiation, real-time status and episode of care program performance for an individual patient, a participating provider’s practice and a payor’s overall program. 
•We use episode definitions to analyze data and help determine a fair benchmark price for a specific episode. We are able to utilize a payor or provider’s historical claims data and benchmark data, and trend that data forward to make predictions about future costs for individual episodes at the individual provider level. 
•We can help payors determine where and how episodes of care can improve care coordination, reduce expenditures and improve outcomes for their members, and we can help design an episode of care program, develop pricing, recruit and contract with participating providers, provide protocols for launching a program and engage directly with contracted providers on care optimization. 
•We have a field-based organization that recruits healthcare provider organizations into episode of care programs and then helps them implement care redesign and manage episode of care programs. 
•We have a proprietary suite of software tools, called Signify Connect, which includes our Episode Connect software that supports health systems and physician organizations in managing their episode of care programs. This platform includes workflow tools that identify patients using predictive analytics, assist with the creation and implementation of care coordination plans, facilitate communication between providers across a patient’s care team and enable providers to manage and track a patient’s care during an episode of care. 
•We have decision support tools to support providers when important decisions are being made upon discharge from an acute care facility on the next site of care. Our decision support tools are grounded in clinical information, at the individual episode level, to help healthcare providers transition patients to the optimal next care setting. For our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care services, we also have decision support tools that support decision making around appropriate sites of care, such as whether a particular procedure should be performed at an acute-care hospital or an ambulatory surgery center. 
•We have an expansive analytics platform that includes a real-time dashboard that delivers information at the aggregate level as well as at the patient level, and a wide range of reports that enables users to configure how they want to see the data available from Episode Connect and the other data sources that populate our longitudinal view of individual patients. 
•We offer comprehensive administrative services that support the back-office activities required to launch and manage episode of care programs. 
In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we offer a variety of solutions to help our customers participate in episode-based programs.
Medicare Bundled Payment for Care Improvement
We are the largest convener participant in the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI-A”) program by number of episodes managed. In this role, we hold contracts directly with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) pursuant to which we are responsible for developing and monitoring a BPCI-A episode of care program in partnership with healthcare providers. We enter into back-to-back contracts with providers participating in the BPCI-A program, whereby we facilitate coordination among providers and share financial risk. To enable our provider partners to successfully participate in BPCI-A, we provide a suite of analytic, technology and post-acute management services in exchange for an administrative fee (which is paid out of savings) and a share of any incremental savings or losses related to episodes initiated by our provider partners.
BPCI-A employs a retrospective payment system in which Medicare reimburses providers in accordance with their usual fee-for-service (“FFS”) payment schedule, while also tracking the total FFS costs for all billable services rendered during the episode period (generally 90 days from the date of discharge from the acute-care facility). Upon completion of each episode, CMS compares the total amount of all FFS payments made during the episode against a predetermined benchmark price. If the total FFS costs of the episode exceeds the benchmark price, the designated program participant owes the difference to CMS, and likewise, if total FFS costs of the episode are lower than the benchmark price, then CMS pays the difference (representing the incremental savings achieved) to the designated program participant after CMS has first taken a discount.
While increasing care coordination has been shown to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs in the healthcare system, it can require significant time and specialized resources that many healthcare systems, hospitals and physician group practices lack. We address these needs and enable our provider partners to successfully participate in BPCI-A by providing data analytics, tools and support from the initial stages of care redesign, to 
identifying and tracking individuals, to managing patients’ post-acute care, through handling program reconciliation and the distribution of shared savings. Our services include the following:
•Data Integration & Patient Identification: We set up secure data feeds with our provider partners and are able to receive data from all leading electronic health record (“EHR”) systems, which allows us access to real-time EHR data in order to quickly predict and identify individuals that are likely to be attributed to a BPCI-A bundle. When a clinical event or procedure occurs which initiates, or “triggers,” an episode, our proprietary software platform, Episode Connect, identifies the individual. This allows providers to begin tracking the individual’s care journey enabling them to intervene at key moments in the journey. 
•Care Redesign Processes: Our approach is designed to create lasting change in the management of higher-risk patients in the acute and post-acute setting. We utilize locally based team members to engage with our provider partners in an effort to maximize patient recovery and stabilization. In the acute setting, we focus on key goals around effective transition to the appropriate post-acute facility for the patient by partnering directly within the acute-care hospital with all members of the typically interdisciplinary team treating a patient. In the post-acute setting, our team works directly with the facility and provider to align processes that support improved patient outcomes. 
•Decision Support Tools: Once an individual is ready to be discharged from the acute setting, our suite of tools provides recommendations on the most appropriate next site of care (e.g., home vs. post-acute facility), as well as information on the post-acute providers within our network that may best be able to support the patient’s needs. 
•Post-Acute Network Development & Management: To further facilitate coordination of care, we develop and manage local networks of high-quality, high-value healthcare providers, including skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies, which can serve individuals participating in bundles at each stage of care. Our team of post-acute specialists regularly meets with post-acute care providers to review care plans and promote adherence to evidence-based guidelines, providing guidance on early identification of clinical and social gaps that may impact readmissions risks. 
•Incentive Alignment, Gainsharing & Information Sharing: The BPCI-A program permits second-tier payment arrangements between the relevant program provider participant and a downstream healthcare provider who has participated in an individual’s care. Provider partners are permitted to share risk with downstream participating providers as a way to align financial incentives and improve cooperation among providers, generating more favorable patient outcomes and increased savings. We connect our provider partners with downstream providers, and we negotiate and administer these gainsharing agreements on behalf of our customers. We also act as the paying agent, distributing (or collecting) gainsharing payments in connection with each semiannual reconciliation. We also facilitate coordination among these providers. Episode Connect allows these providers to share data, further increasing coordination. For example, our provider partner can review patient-specific information throughout the post-acute care continuum, including patient progress to recovery goals as well as the transition from a post-acute facility to home health services. This type of coordination allows us and our provider partners to better track an individual’s progress and assess when they are ready to self-manage in the home. 
•Reconciliation Analysis, Benchmarking & Performance Review: At the end of each BPCI-A performance measurement period, we review reconciliation statements from CMS, identify errors and distribute shared savings. In addition, our platform generates reports on healthcare providers’ performance, showing their performance benchmarked both against their own historical performance, as well as against peers in their geography. In this way, we close the loop on an episode by providing actionable insights that a provider can use the next time an episode is initiated. 
Non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care
In 2020, we launched our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care services and began offering program sponsors, including health plans, employers and state government agencies, the analytics, software tools and services necessary to design, launch and administer episodes of care programs outside of the BPCI-A context. This opened new markets and, equally significant, new chronic care episodes to us. 
As with our BPCI-A program, we deploy our care coordination resources directly in the field to create the relationship with the local providers that effectively drives process transformation. In addition to the services we provide in the BPCI-A program, we also offer the following services as part of our growing episodes of care business:
•Program Design: Using our advanced data analytics capabilities, we help program sponsors identify the potential benefits of an episode of care program, both from a financial and strategic perspective, and assist them with the initial program design, including episode of care selection and pricing. Importantly, our episode of care programs also include measures designed to improve patient outcomes by reducing the incidence of adverse events and potentially avoidable or wasteful services. 
•Provider Network Recruitment, Contracting & Support: Leveraging our expertise, credibility with providers established through the BPCI-A program and suite of provider tools, we recruit providers into the program sponsor’s episode of care program. By sharing risk with providers, we align incentives and build trust, which we believe puts us in a unique position to encourage program participation and takes the burden of network recruitment off program sponsors. We equip participating providers with tools designed to identify opportunities for improved patient care while achieving cost savings and educate them on the levers that support improved patient outcomes while generating savings within each clinical episode type (which differ considerably from those in the BPCI-A program). 
•Expanded Decision Support Tools: We expand our decision support tools to align to the specific decisions that a provider makes in the expanded episodes, such as the appropriate site of care for a surgery. These tools evaluate quality, cost and convenience. Our tools also update the provider on services that are being delivered during the patient’s care journey. 
•Additional Program Sponsor Support: We deliver to program sponsors a comprehensive analytics platform that includes episode pricing, monitoring and reporting of performance at the individual beneficiary, provider and program level. We perform program reconciliations, provide reconciliation statements to program sponsors and participating providers and collect and distribute program savings and losses among payors and providers.
Transition to Home
In 2020, we introduced our Transition to Home (“TTH”) service, a support model for patients transitioning home from a hospital or a post-acute care facility that aims to reduce the likelihood of readmission. The readmission rate for BPCI-A patients can be greater than 30%, and we estimate that the average cost of a readmission of a BPCI-A patient, including related post-acute costs, is approximately $17,000. Leveraging our provider network and community-based services, we work to prevent readmissions by providing individuals with continued support from our social care coordinators and, when necessary, our nurses and nurse practitioners.
Complex Care Management
We also offer health plans a solution to manage the clinical needs and well-being of their members with complex chronic conditions through a multi-disciplinary approach. Our providers engage with high-needs individuals in facilities. By looking at an individual’s medical needs and well-being holistically, the provider is able to address elements of the individual’s care plan such as medication adjustments, adherence to care plans and patient behavioral and nutritional needs.
ACO Services
In 2020, we began helping accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) manage the post-acute care of their patient populations. Our ACO solution expands on the BPCI-A definitions with a more comprehensive suite of episodic conditions that are managed through the post-acute setting. We use the same data analytics capabilities we use in our BPCI-A services to analyze historical data and identify opportunities for post-acute cost savings for ACOs. In addition, ACOs have access to our platform through which they can access data across care settings and follow the patient more closely throughout the post-acute episode. This information allows ACOs to make informed decisions with respect to, among other things, treatment, cost management, next site of care and length of post-acute care. Finally, we utilize our teams of acute and post-acute specialists to support the delivery of appropriate post-acute care to ACO patients. 
Industry
Total U.S. healthcare spending exceeded $4.1 trillion in 2020 and we operate in the large market associated with payment for healthcare services. We serve needs of healthcare funding sources including Medicare, Medicaid, employers and private health plans. Signify Health operates in the value-based payment sector of the healthcare industry. We believe value-based payments have grown dramatically over the past ten years and are expected to eventually represent the majority of healthcare spending in the United States according to studies by Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (“HCP-LAN”) and other research reports by industry analysts, which suggest that approximately 75% of total U.S. health spending is expected to be tied to quality and value by 2025 through the adoption of new payment models focused on value. We believe this will especially be the case as value-based payment models continue to penetrate the commercial insured and self-funded markets. Our leadership position in enabling some of the most significant risk programs has allowed us to invest in and develop differentiated scale and expertise around analytics, technology, networks, and relationships to grow rapidly as demand for services in the value-based payment industry increases over time.
Industry reports estimate the current addressable market for value-based payor programs, such as Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, is at least $300 billion, with 84 million members enrolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care. Under such payor value-based care programs, payor rates are set based upon overall population risk. Through these arrangements, payors take on risk and need to develop an accurate picture of the health of their patient population in order to receive appropriate funding. Adjusting funding based upon a member’s health helps stabilize payor value-based care programs and incentivizes payors to enroll both healthy and higher cost members. A critical element to developing and understanding the overall health of a patient population is an accurate health evaluation in the home and coding of each individual patient’s health conditions. While the overall cost to perform these activities is a small component of total spending, there is significant value from the resulting data that is captured.
According to HCP-LAN, in 2018, approximately $400 billion of provider spending flowed through value-based payment models, such as bundled payment models, which are alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service payment models. HCP-LAN reported that of this $400 billion, approximately $200 billion of spending was through 
value-based payment models where providers also assumed potential risk in the event of suboptimal outcomes, as opposed to models where providers only stood to benefit from shared savings without the possibility of bearing downside risk. Under provider value-based care programs, healthcare provider reimbursement is tied to the outcomes and the overall quality of care delivered to patients. Value-based care reimbursement is different from the standard fee-for-service model in that providers are reimbursed based on the financial value of the healthcare services they provide and are rewarded for both efficiency and effectiveness. In order for providers to be able to participate in value-based care models, they need to utilize solutions that can track and report on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, patient engagement, and more. They also need tools to help them analyze costs, redesign care and align incentives with other healthcare providers. These solutions are used to organize and finance healthcare delivery around a patient’s episode of care to ensure higher quality outcomes at improved costs.
Competition
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily in the market associated with payment for healthcare services, where large and small companies are formulating innovative ways to transition the healthcare market to value-based care with an increasing focus on treating individuals within the home. In our Home & Community Services segment, we compete with local and national providers of in-home diagnostic and evaluative services. Our competitors include pure-play companies whose principal business is providing health risk assessments and similar services as well as large payors that have in-house capabilities for performing a portion of their health risk assessments in house. We believe our IHEs offer a more comprehensive visit than traditional health risk assessments provided by our competitors. Among pure-play companies, our primary competitor is Matrix Medical Network, which we believe is the only other pure-play company providing IHEs with national scale. With respect to large payors, most large payors use a variety of different providers for their IHE volume and several large payors service a portion of their total volume with their own in-house capabilities. For example, UnitedHealth has a division called OptumCare, which performs health risk assessments for a portion of the payor’s plan members. As a result, we compete with these in-house capabilities for additional volume. Although large payors, such as UnitedHealth, have more resources than we do, because we focus principally on IHEs and have dedicated significant resources to building the breadth of our national network, we believe we are able to more efficiently perform IHEs than these in-house divisions and we have consistently increased our volume with large payors such as UnitedHealth in recent years.
In our Home & Community Services segment, we also compete for, among other things, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other medical and non-medical personnel. In particular, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining qualified providers for our mobile network, in particular from telehealth service providers. However, we believe we remain competitive in recruiting providers given the in-home nature of our business.
In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we compete with healthcare risk management providers, primarily in the BPCI-A space. Our competitors include companies like us that convene (i.e., contract) with CMS on behalf of healthcare providers as well as physician group practices that “self-convene” under BPCI-A, meaning they contract directly with CMS to participate in BPCI-A rather than working through a company like Signify Health. In terms of traditional conveners, we compete with naviHealth (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth), OptumCare, Fusion5 and Archway. The largest self-conveners include Sound Physicians and other large physician group practices. To a lesser extent, we also compete with companies such as Change Healthcare that provide ancillary services to support the BPCI-A management process, such as software for patient tracking or analytics services. Because we provide a full suite of management solutions (e.g. advanced analytics, post-acute network services and technology), we have not faced significant competition to date from these companies, although we may face more intense competition from them in the future.
In the non-BPCI-A episodes of care space, we believe we are one of the only companies offering a comprehensive suite of services and technology solutions to help customers build episode programs and then recruit providers to participate. However, we do compete with companies offering episodes of care or bundled payment consulting services. In this space, we compete primarily with Aver, Cognizant and Cedar Gate.
Our principal competitors in both of our segments vary considerably in type and identity by market. There have also been increasing indications of interest from non-traditional providers and others to enter the in-home diagnostic and evaluative services space and/or develop innovative technologies or business activities that could be disruptive to the healthcare risk management industry.
Sales and Marketing
In each of our segments, we focus our sales and marketing initiatives on three primary dimensions of growth: (1) sales to new customers, (2) cross-sales to existing customers and (3) product expansion with existing customers. In order to successfully obtain new customers and to cross-sell solutions to existing customers, we have a strong sales team that is organized by segment as well as by product/service offered. For example, we have sales representatives dedicated to selling our IHE solutions in our Home & Community Services segment. These representatives are responsible for selling our IHE solutions to new customers as well as cross-selling to existing customers.
Similarly, in our Episodes of Care Services segment, we have representatives dedicated to selling our solutions to new and existing customers. For example, since 2019, BPCI-A participants have not been able to change their convener and will not be able to do so until the program expires in 2023, assuming it is renewed. However, we are able to offer our full suite of solutions to self-conveners to support their participation in BPCI-A, even though they do not participate in BPCI-A through us. Our sales representatives that specialize in BPCI-A are currently focused on selling our services to self-convener participants that we do not currently work with. We also believe there are significant cross-selling opportunities in our Episodes of Care Services segment. For example, most of our BPCI-A customers also serve ACO populations and we have dedicated sales representatives focused on selling our ACO services to our BPCI-A customers.
In terms of product expansion with existing customers, we also have a certain number of sales representatives that are not organized by segment, but are instead responsible for managing significant existing customer relationships. These representatives focus on engaging with our customers and finding ways that we can expand and grow with our customers. For example, these representatives may focus on increasing the volume of IHEs we perform for existing customers in our Home & Community Services segment, or they may work with existing BPCI-A customers to see if there is different or better data available to guide a customer through the program.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand, technology and inventions; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We also obtain written invention assignment agreements from our employees, consultants, and vendors that assign to us all right, interest and title to inventions and work products developed during their employment or service engagement with us.
We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2021, we exclusively owned 20 trademark 
applications and registrations in the United States, including for the core Signify Health ® trademark. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use or may use in our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had no issued patents and no pending patent applications anywhere in the world, other than one patent application which we intend to abandon. At present, we do not have patent protection for any of our proprietary technology, including our proprietary software, mobile app or web portal. 
Given the rapid pace of technical development, we rely upon trade secrets, confidential know-how and copyrights in software to develop and maintain our competitive position. In order to protect our innovations, we seek to control access to and distribution of our confidential and proprietary information, including our algorithms, source and object code, designs, and business processes, through physical, technical, and administrative security measures and contractual restrictions. We seek to limit access to our confidential and proprietary information on a “need to know” basis and enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors that may receive or otherwise have access to any confidential or proprietary information. 
Government Regulation
Our operations and those of the providers we employ and contract with are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, billing and coding for services and reports to government payment programs; quality of equipment and services; dispensing of pharmaceuticals; personnel qualifications; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; maintenance and interoperability of health-related and medical records; privacy and security of health-related and personal information; communication with patients and consumers; and quality assurance programs.
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies and private members and payors with whom we contract in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk factors—Risks related to governmental regulation.”
Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Bundled Payment Initiatives and ACOs
Medicare
Medicare is a federal program available to individuals age 65 or over, and certain other individuals, that generally provides healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals, subject to certain deductibles and copayments. CMS administers the Medicare program through various contractors.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of products and procedures by Medicare. In general, to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. Medicare coverage and reimbursement is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, any of which may materially increase or decrease the reimbursement received by healthcare providers. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting the Medicare program and entities with which we contract could have a material effect on our performance.
Medicare Advantage
Under the Medicare Advantage program, also known as Medicare Part C, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. In addition, Medicare Advantage Plans may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and plan costs on beneficiaries. Generally, supplemental benefits must be primarily health related, a definition that may include certain nonmedical services. For beneficiaries with chronic illnesses, Medicare Advantage plans may also offer special supplemental benefits that are not primarily health related but that can improve or maintain the health or overall function of enrollees, giving plans greater flexibility to provide benefits that address social determinants of health.
Medicare Advantage plans can be structured as Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”), Preferred Provider Organizations (“PPOs”) or private FFS plans. Medicare beneficiaries that choose to participate in Medicare Advantage choose which health plan through which to receive their Medicare coverage. To assist beneficiaries with plan selection, CMS maintains a five-star quality rating system. Using this system, CMS publishes Star Ratings based on a variety of quality, patient experience and performance measures for health plans on an annual basis. These ratings are based on data gathered from a variety of sources, including HEDIS, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program, the Medicare Health Outcome Survey, the Medicare Prescription Drug Program and CMS administrative data. CMS updates its rating methodology annually. According to CMS, over one-third of all Medicare enrollees participate in Medicare Advantage plans.
CMS generally pays health insurance plans that participate in the Medicare Advantage program on a per enrollee basis. Medicare Advantage plans submit bids to CMS for their estimated cost of Medicare Part A and B benefits for an average enrollee, and CMS compares the bids against benchmarks, which are determined based on projected average spending for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare, and which may be adjusted based on the Medicare Advantage plan’s star rating. Payments to Medicare Advantage plans are risk adjusted based on the health status and other characteristics of enrollees. Plans with higher average risk scores receive higher Medicare payments, since their enrollees are expected to incur higher costs. The IHEs that we provide for our health plan customers may be used, in part, to support risk adjustment factor (“RAF”) scores attributable to the Medicare Advantage plan members and, thus, payment adjustments made by CMS. RAF scores are central to payment under Medicare Advantage programs in which our customers participate. CMS routinely adjusts the RAF and the monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that our customers manage in their member populations. 
CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans for documentation to support RAF-related payments for members chosen at random. Such audits may result in payment adjustments to a Medicare Advantage plan, including extrapolation across the entire contract. Our health plan customers may seek to hold us liable for penalties owed to CMS for the plan’s submission of inaccurate or unsupportable RAF scores based on information provided by us. In addition, the government or a whistleblower could assert that our errors caused our health plan customers to submit false claims to CMS, which could subject us to liability under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) if the government could prove the elements of an FCA claim. 
Medicare Sequestration
Beginning in 2013, Medicare reimbursement has been reduced due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which requires across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget, also known as sequestration. These sequestration cuts include reductions in payments for Medicare and other federally funded healthcare programs. The Medicare spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year. The 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and related legislation have temporarily suspended these reductions through March 31, 2022, and reduced the sequestration adjustment from 2% to 1% from April 1 through June 30, 2022, but also extended the reductions through 2030 and increased the reductions set for 2030. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional sequestration mandated under the Pay As You Go Act of 2010. As a result, a further payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take effect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2023.
Medicaid
Medicaid programs provide medical assistance benefits to qualifying (typically low income or medically needy) persons. Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) or are based on negotiated payment levels. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a healthcare provider’s cost of services. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. Some states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Other states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. 
Because most state governments must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, many states have adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Outside of the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Many states have adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on healthcare providers to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. The prior presidential administration increased state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including by allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement. However, the current presidential administration issued an executive order directing agencies to re-examine measures that reduce health insurance coverage or undermine Medicaid programs, and the administration has rescinded approvals of waivers for work and community engagement requirements
Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse healthcare providers for treatment of certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to healthcare providers for the treatment of healthcare-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.
Congress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims, identify overpayments, and perform other program integrity activities. The UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate healthcare provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are required to establish Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) programs. These programs vary by state in design and operation.
Bundled Payment Initiatives
The CMS Innovation Center is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while improving quality of care. For example, healthcare providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to be responsible for the costs of services provided to Medicare patients experiencing certain medical conditions which trigger an episode of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding healthcare providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing healthcare providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Healthcare providers may receive incentive payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode falls below or exceeds a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. 
The CMS Innovation Center has implemented bundled payment models, including the BPCI-A program, which is voluntary and expected to run through December 2023. Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but has required healthcare providers in selected geographic areas to participate in a mandatory bundled program for specified orthopedic procedures, the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, which is scheduled to run through December 2024. In addition, as of January 1, 2021, CMS began requiring certain hospitals to participate in a bundled payment initiative for end-stage renal disease treatment. CMS had also indicated that it plans to require certain hospitals to participate in a radiation oncology model beginning as early as January 1, 2023. 
In October 2021, the CMS Innovation Center published an outline of its strategy for the next decade, noting the need to accelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the CMS Innovation Center aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and most Medicaid beneficiaries in a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care. CMS also indicated it will streamline its payment model portfolio and consider how to ensure broad provider participation, including by implementing more mandatory models. Moreover, several private third-party payers are increasingly employing alternative payment models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to healthcare providers.
Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives
An Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) is a network of healthcare providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program.
Fraud and Abuse
Participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation. A variety of laws govern various aspects of our business relationships and our relationships with physicians and others who either refer or may influence the referral of patients or certain business or are the recipients of such referrals. These laws include, but are not limited to, the FCA, federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (“Stark Law”), the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, other federal civil and criminal fraud and abuse laws and similar state laws. We have carefully structured our arrangements in 
accordance with applicable guidance and endeavor to be in compliance with all the fraud and abuse laws. However, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine our arrangements are compliant. If any of our business transactions or arrangements are found to violate these laws, we may be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties and it may be necessary to restructure existing business arrangements. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge to our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense or settlement by us.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
The AKS prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. By statute, actual knowledge of the AKS or specific intent to violate the law is not required in order to engage in prohibited conduct.
Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the AKS include imprisonment, fines and exclusion from future involvement with federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the AKS are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of the AKS include substantial civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject to annual adjustment based on updates to the consumer price index, payments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA.
The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe harbor do not violate the AKS. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the intent of the parties and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. 
Amongst the exceptions and safe harbors to the AKS that are relevant to our business is the eligible managed care organization (“EMCO”) safe harbor. It provides protection to certain arrangements between Medicare Advantage plans and other EMCOs and first tier contractors or between first tier contractors and downstream contractors or between two downstream contractors. The EMCO safe harbor is premised on the view that many managed care arrangements do not present the same risks of overutilization or increased federal healthcare program costs that can exist with certain fee-for-service payment arrangements. Key to safe harbor protection for certain arrangements under the EMCO safe harbor is that payments not be tied to business outside the EMCO arrangement and that costs to federal healthcare programs not be inappropriately increased or shifted. As noted above, failure to fully satisfy a safe harbor does not make an arrangement illegal. Instead, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the intent of the parties and the arrangement’s potential for abuse.
Our episodes of care programs involve a number of arrangements that potentially implicate the AKS because they may involve payments intended to influence behavior relative to Medicare and other federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including risk sharing and “gainsharing” arrangements. While there is no fixed definition of a 
gainsharing arrangement, the term typically refers to an arrangement in which a share of cost savings for patient care attributable in part to a physician’s efforts are shared with the physician. The OIG has recognized that there are legitimate interests in enlisting physicians in efforts to reduce unnecessary costs from the healthcare system and, if appropriately structured, such gainsharing arrangements should not violate the AKS. With respect to BPCI-A and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of the AKS and certain other fraud and abuse laws. However, with respect to our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. Effective in early 2021, CMS and OIG, as part of their so-called regulatory sprint to coordinated care, established new safe harbors that protect certain value-based arrangements. We continue to assess how these new safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. 
Stark Law
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing “designated health services” (“DHS”) from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing DHS that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” DHS to another entity with which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute where unlawful intent need not be demonstrated. Although uncertainty exists, federal agencies and some courts have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid.
DHS is defined to include clinical laboratory services; physical therapy services; occupational therapy services; radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging; computerized axial tomography scans; and ultrasound services; radiation therapy services and supplies; durable medical equipment and supplies; parenteral and enteral nutrients; equipment and supplies; prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies; home health services; outpatient prescription drugs; inpatient and outpatient hospital services; and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The definition of DHS under the Stark Law does not include outpatient physician services. Since many services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided through our programs are outpatient physician services, our services do not always implicate the Stark Law referral prohibition. However, certain services we may provide, including certain diagnostic testing, may be considered DHS.
The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. 
If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, and substantial civil monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. Civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index.
Our episode of care programs involve a number of arrangements that potentially implicate the Stark Law because they may involve payments between a physician and an entity providing DHS in connection with Medicare patients, including risk sharing and gainsharing arrangements. With respect to BPCI-A and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of the Stark Law. With respect to our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. Effective in early 2021, CMS established new exceptions to the Stark Law that protect certain value-based arrangements. We continue to assess how these new exceptions may apply to both new and existing programs.
The False Claims Act
The FCA is the government’s primary means of policing false claims for payment in the healthcare delivery system. The FCA imposes treble damages and per claim penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:
•knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; 
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; 
•knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or 
•conspires to commit the above acts. 
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and intentionally reporting of inaccurate risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to Medicare Advantage plans. Claims that result from a violation of the AKS are deemed by statute to be false for purposes of the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. False claims under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following proper identification of an overpayment. 
In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. Under these provisions, within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a healthcare provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute. 
The penalties for a violation of the FCA include up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim, plus substantial civil monetary for each separate false claim. The civil monetary are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. Beyond civil enforcement under the FCA, the federal government can use 
several criminal statutes to prosecute individuals or entities that are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. 
State fraud and abuse laws
Some states have laws prohibiting physicians and other healthcare providers from having financial interests in or with healthcare facilities to which they refer patients. A number of states also have laws similar to or stricter than the AKS that may affect our ability to enter into financial relationships with certain entities or individuals. Some state anti-kickback laws also include civil and criminal penalties. Some of these laws include exemptions that may be applicable to our business. Others, however, may not include explicit exemption for certain aspects of our business. We carefully structure our arrangements to comply with applicable state fraud and abuse laws.
Similarly, states have beneficiary inducement prohibitions and consumer protection laws that may be triggered by the offering of inducements, incentives and other forms of remuneration to patients and prospective patients. Violations range from civil to criminal and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police alleged healthcare fraud, particularly with regard to Medicaid fee-for-service and Managed Medicaid programs
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:
•presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare or other federal healthcare programs that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; 
•offering remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular healthcare provider; 
•arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal healthcare programs; 
•violating the AKS; 
•being involved in a hospital or a critical access hospital knowingly making a payment, directly or indirectly, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided with respect to Medicare or Medicaid patients who are under the direct care of the physician; 
•making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program; 
•making or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of healthcare services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program, including Medicare Advantage Organizations (“MAOs”) and entities that apply to participate as healthcare providers of services or suppliers in such managed care organizations and such plans; and 
•failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government. 
Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
Our episodes of care programs involve a number of arrangements that potentially implicate aspects of the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute because they may involve payments intended to influence behavior of physicians relative to Medicare and other federal healthcare program beneficiaries, including risk sharing and gainsharing arrangements. Such arrangements could be viewed as implicating the AKS or the prohibition against hospitals making payments to physicians to reduce or limit medically necessary services to Medicare or Medicaid patients under their direct care. With respect to BPCI-A and other CMS innovation models in which we may participate, the OIG and CMS jointly issued waivers of the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute. 
With respect to our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care program and any other episode of care programs in which we may participate, there are no fraud and abuse waivers that are directly applicable. There are, however, new exceptions to the Civil Monetary Penalties Statue that protect certain value-based arrangements. We continue to assess how these new exceptions and safe harbors may apply to both new and existing programs. 
We could be exposed to a wide range of other allegations involving the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute. We perform checks on our providers, healthcare provider organizations, and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual or entity become excluded and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed by or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual or entity. Thus, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws
We are subject to various state laws, regulations and legal and administrative decisions that restrict the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. The corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits corporate entities from practicing medicine or employing physicians (and, in some cases, other providers) to provide professional medical services. The doctrine reflects a variety of historical public policy concerns, including concerns that (a) allowing corporations to practice medicine or employ physicians will result in the commercialization of the practice of medicine, (b) a corporation’s obligation to its shareholders may not align with a physician’s obligation to his/her patients and (c) employment of a physician by a corporation may interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment. While many states have some form of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, the scope and enforcement varies widely. In those states where the doctrine exists, it typically arises from the state’s medical practice act, but has been shaped over the years by state statutes, regulations, court decisions, attorney general opinions and actions by state medical licensing boards.
Historically, the medical profession has recognized an ethical prohibition against physicians (and often other providers) paying professional peers and others for referrals and fee splitting. Fee splitting generally occurs when a physician splits part of the professional fee earned from treating a referred patient with the source of the referral. Among the public policy harms that have been cited in support of fee splitting prohibitions are (a) unnecessary medical services, and (b) incompetent specialists. In response to these legitimate concerns, many states have adopted prohibitions against fee splitting. States have taken a variety of legislative approaches to fee splitting, from near 
complete bans, to bans with various exceptions, to no prohibition at all. Some of the prohibitions, have a broad reach and also prohibit otherwise legitimate business relationships with entities that are not healthcare providers, such as billing agencies or management companies.
Legal structures have been developed to comply with various state corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws. The “captive” or “friendly” professional corporation model allows a legal entity (typically a professional corporation or professional limited liability company) whose shareholders are all physicians to employ the physicians (and other providers). The physician entity then contracts with a corporate entity referred to as a management services organization (“MSO”) to provide various management services. The physician entity is kept “friendly” through a stock transfer restriction agreement and/or other relationship between the MSO and the physician owners of the professional corporation. The fees under the management services arrangement must be carefully structured to comply with state fee splitting laws, which in some states may prohibit percentage-based fees.
Provider licensure and telehealth laws
We utilize the services of a variety of providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists and nurses, among others. States generally require providers providing professional healthcare services, whether in person or via telehealth, to a patient residing within the state to be licensed in that state. States have established a variety of licensing and other regulatory requirements around the provision of telehealth services. These requirements vary from state to state. Many states require notification of certain material events be provided to the applicable licensing agency. We have established systems for ensuring that our providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to patients with whom we interact occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the providers as well as civil, criminal or administrative penalties against the providers and/or entities engaging the services of the provider.
Privacy and security
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that are designed to protect the uses and disclosures of certain types of individually identifiable data. These include the federal regulations promulgated under the authority of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) that require us to provide certain protections to individuals and their health information. Further all 50 states and certain territories maintain additional laws regulating the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (“PII”). The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and health plans, and their business associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide individuals with substantive rights with respect to their health information. As we look to expand our workforce into Ireland, we may also be subject to international data protection regulations related to the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes strict compliance obligations on the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of PII and creates enhanced rights for individuals.
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with our covered entity customers and our subcontractors, also known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations and may be found liable for the violations of their agents.
HIPAA requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach. If a business associate is acting as an agent of a covered entity, then the covered entity must provide the required notifications to individuals based on the time when the business associate discovered the breach. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. Impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and the state regulators in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised. State laws and standard practice often provide for shorter data breach reporting timelines than required by HIPAA.
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. OCR is required to perform compliance audits and investigates HIPAA compliance in response to complaints and reports of breaches. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. OCR may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but OCR has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging noncompliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, creation, receipt, transmission, storage, and other processing of medical information and other types of PII. Privacy and data security statutes and regulations vary from state to state, and these laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its implementing rules. These laws and regulations protect data pertaining to specific conditions, such as substance use disorder, HIV/AIDS, genetic disorders, and mental and behavioral health. Under the CARES Act Congress made significant modifications to the authorizing statute for the regulations that regulate the confidentiality of substance use disorder data, known as the “Part 2 Regulations.” The CAREs Act changes significantly align the statutory requirements more closely with the HIPAA privacy rule. The law directs the Secretary of HHS to revise the Part 2 Regulations to align with the statutory changes, but the regulations have not yet been published.
Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are also increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit other types of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, and which will be significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will become fully effective on January 1, 2023, applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals’ requests regarding their personal information. The CPRA also creates a new enforcement agency to enforce the CCPA and CPRA and imposes additional requirements, including privacy risk assessments, audits and vendor contractual requirements for data sharing, license and access arrangements. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations and allow private rights of action for data breaches. Virginia and Colorado have also passed comprehensive privacy legislation, and several other states, as well as federal lawmakers, have proposed additional consumer privacy legislation. The complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection and information security creates significant compliance challenges for us, potentially restricts our ability to collect, use 
and disclose data, and exposes us to additional expense, and, if we cannot comply with applicable laws in a timely manner or at all, adverse publicity, harm to our reputation, and liability.
Telecommunications and telemarketing laws
Our marketing and communications activities may be subject to a variety of federal and state laws that regulate telecommunications and telemarketing activities, including the following.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) places restrictions on making certain telemarketing calls, non-telemarketing calls, faxes, and SMS text messages to consumers. Prior express consent of consumers may be required to override certain activities prohibited under the TCPA. The scope and interpretation of the TCPA, and other laws that are or may be applicable to making calls and delivering SMS text messages to consumers, are continuously evolving and developing. TCPA violations may be subject to penalties of $500 per violation and $1,500 for each willful or knowing violation. Recent expansion of the law through the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (“TRACED”) Act expanded the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 per call for intentional violations of federal robocall laws and increased the time period that the FCC can take action against those who intentionally violate federal law to four years. This penalty is in addition to other penalties for TCPA violations.
The CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial email messages. It prohibits the inclusion of deceptive or misleading information and subject headings and requires identifying information such as a return address in email messages. The CAN-SPAM Act also specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that do not comply with certain requirements, such as providing an opt-out mechanism for stopping future emails from senders.
While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with such laws and regulations, our interpretation of these laws and regulations or our implementation of our policies and procedures may be subjected to challenge through class action lawsuits or regulatory actions which could subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our marketing and communications practices violate communications privacy laws could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge to our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense or settlement by us.
Healthcare reform
The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with various scientific and technological innovations. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed and implemented a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect significant change within the U.S. healthcare system, including the ACA. The ACA affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. A number of ACA provisions impacted and continue to impact our business and operations. More broadly, we are unable to predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to healthcare reform legislation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future.
The ACA has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes. For example, effective January 1, 2019, the financial penalty associated with the ACA’s individual mandate that most individuals enroll in a qualifying health insurance plan was eliminated. This change resulted in legal challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and validity of the Affordable Care Act as a whole. However, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court 
determined that the plaintiffs lacked standing, allowing the law to remain in place. Nonetheless, the elimination of the individual mandate penalty and other changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. 
The current presidential administration has indicated that it generally intends to protect and strengthen the ACA and Medicaid programs. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health insurance coverage. In a final rule published in September 2021, HHS extended the annual open enrollment period for coverage through federal marketplaces and granted state exchanges flexibility to lengthen their open enrollment periods.
There is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the ACA due to the potential for continued changes to the law’s implementation and its interpretation by government agencies and courts. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored health insurance coverage, including single-payor models, and some states have implemented or are considering public health insurance options. Legislative and executive branch efforts related to healthcare reform could result in increased prices for consumers purchasing health insurance coverage, or destabilize insurance markets, among other effects.
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the current healthcare marketplace and the future of healthcare reform. Future elections may create conditions for Congress to adopt new federal coverage programs that may disrupt our current revenue streams both from payors and other government programs.
It is possible that future legislative or regulatory changes could lower our reimbursement rates, increase our expenses, require us to modify certain aspects of our operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Other regulations
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.
Federal and state law also governs the storage, handling and dispensing of controlled substances. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Any allegations or findings that we or our provider partners have violated any of these laws or regulations could result in criminal or civil liability, including significant monetary fines, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Employees and Human Capital
Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,300 employees, of which approximately 2,200 employees were full time. Our employees are based at our offices located in Norwalk, CT, Dallas, TX, New York, NY, Rapid City, SD and Deerfield, FL or are full-time remote. We also had over 10,000 credentialed physicians and nurse practitioners and other providers within our mobile network that we contract with on an independent contractor basis, either directly or through captive professional affiliates. These credentialed physicians and nurse practitioners form a mobile network of practitioners located all over the country. We consider our relationship with our independent contractors and employees to be positive. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
We strive to foster an innovative culture as we further build our business and expand our products and services, and we view our human capital-related initiatives as an ongoing priority. Such initiatives include: (i) implementing a robust talent acquisition approach, including competitive pay and benefits, (ii) implementing our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiative and Spirit of Signify programs to promote diversity and foster a sense of connection and community throughout our Company, (iii) offering an array of learning and development opportunities, including live programs and online courses through our learning management system and (iv) conducting annual employee engagement surveys and developing action plans based on the survey outcomes. 
Customers 
Our customers consist primarily of health plans and providers and, to a lesser extent, state and government agencies, employers and other risk-bearing entities. Revenue from our top ten customers across our segments accounted for approximately 78% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In our Home & Community Services segment, our customers are primarily Medicare Advantage health plans and managed Medicaid organizations. We currently serve 58 health plans in the United States, including 24 of the 50 largest Medicare Advantage plans. In 2021, each of our three largest customers in this segment represented more than 10% of our total revenue.
In our Episodes of Care Services segment, we serve a variety of customers. All of our direct contracts to participate in the BPCI-A program are with CMS. Our customers for BPCI-A management services are primarily providers, including healthcare provider organizations. Within our emerging businesses, our ACO management services are directed at ACOs participating in CMS’ Medicare Shared Savings Program; our non-BPCI-A Episodes of Care solution is directed at health plans, employers, state and government agencies and providers looking to launch programs centered around care redesign; our TTH services are offered to providers participating in the BPCI-A program; and our Complex Care Management business serves health plans. 
Initial Public Offering and Internal Reorganization
On February 16, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 27,025,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at an offering price of $24.00 per share for net proceeds of $609.7 million. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on February 11, 2021 under the symbol “SGFY.
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on October 1, 2020, and were formed for the purpose of completing the IPO and related transactions in order to carry on the business of Cure TopCo, LLC (“Cure TopCo”) 
as a publicly-traded entity. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a series of transactions with Cure TopCo to implement an internal reorganization (the “Reorganization Transactions”) as follows:
•Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock (collectively, our “common stock”); 
•Cure TopCo entered into the Amended LLC Agreement to, among other things, appoint us as the sole managing member of Cure TopCo and to modify Cure TopCo’s capital structure to reclassify the equity interests into a single class of LLC units (the “LLC Units”). Under the Amended LLC Agreement, holders of LLC Units (other than us and our wholly owned subsidiaries), including each Pre-IPO LLC Member who retained its equity ownership in Cure TopCo in the form of LLC Units immediately following the Reorganization Transactions (each a “Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Member”), have the right (subject to the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement), to require Cure TopCo to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Units for, at our election, newly issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the volume-weighted average market price of one share of our Class A common stock for each LLC Unit redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications) in accordance with the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement. Additionally, in the event of a redemption request from a holder of LLC Units, we may, at our option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A common stock for LLC Units in lieu of such a redemption. Shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled on a one-for-one basis if we, following a redemption request from a holder of LLC Units, redeem or exchange LLC Units of such holder pursuant to the terms of the Amended LLC Agreement. Except for transfers to us or to certain permitted transferees pursuant to the Amended LLC Agreement, the LLC Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of;
•We acquired, directly and indirectly, LLC Units through (i) the contribution of LLC Units in exchange for shares of Class A common stock by New Mountain Partners V (AIV-C), LP (the “IPO Contribution”) and (ii) the “Mergers,” in which certain entities treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes that held LLC Units (individually, a “Blocker Company” and together, the “Blocker Companies”) each simultaneously merged with a merger subsidiary created by us (and survived such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Signify Health), after which each Blocker Company immediately merged into Signify Health (with each such merger into Signify Health having occurred simultaneously); 
•Each Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Member was issued a number of shares of our Class B common stock equal to the number of LLC Units held by such Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Member, except in the case of Cure Aggregator, LLC (“Cure Aggregator”). Cure Aggregator is a special purpose investment vehicle through which certain members of Cure TopCo, primarily our employees and certain legacy investors, indirectly hold interests in Cure TopCo. Cure Aggregator holds LLC Units on behalf of such members on a one-for-one basis with each member’s interests in Cure Aggregator. Such common units in Cure Aggregator are subject to certain vesting requirements. In connection with the Reorganization Transactions, shares of Class B common stock were issued to the direct holders of common units in Cure Aggregator in proportion to their interests in Cure Aggregator, provided that such shares are not entitled to any voting rights until such time as the common units of Cure Aggregator corresponding to such shares have vested; 
•We used all of the net proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued LLC Units from Cure TopCo at a purchase price per LLC Unit equal to the initial public offering price of Class A common stock, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions;
•We entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement that obligates us to make payments to the Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Members, the shareholders of the Blocker Companies, Optionholders (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) of the Blocker Companies at the time of the Mergers, holders of synthetic equity 
units and any future party to the Tax Receivable Agreement (collectively, the “TRA Parties”) in the aggregate generally equal to 85% of the applicable cash savings that we actually realize as a result of (i) certain favorable tax attributes acquired from the Blocker Companies in the Mergers (including net operating losses, the Blocker Companies’ allocable share of existing tax basis and refunds of Blocker Company taxes attributable to pre-Merger tax periods), (ii) increases in our allocable share of existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments that may result from (x) future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units by Continuing Pre-IPO LLC Members for cash or Class A common stock, (y) the IPO Contribution and (z) certain payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iii) deductions in respect of interest and certain compensatory payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these tax savings;
•We caused Cure TopCo to use the proceeds from the issuance of LLC Units to us (i) to pay fees and expenses of approximately $13.5 million in connection with the IPO and the Reorganization Transactions and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including working capital and potential strategic acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses or technologies that we believe will complement our current business and expansion strategies; and 
•We entered into the stockholders’ agreement with certain Pre-IPO LLC Members.
Effects of the Reorganization on our Corporate Structure
Signify Health was initially formed for the purpose of the IPO. Signify Health is a holding company and its sole material asset is a controlling ownership and economic interest in Cure TopCo. All of our business is conducted through Cure TopCo and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, and the financial results of Cure TopCo and its consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of Signify Health for periods subsequent to the effective date of the reorganization.
Cure TopCo is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including Signify Health, pay taxes with respect to their allocable share of its net taxable income. We expect that redemptions and exchanges of LLC Units will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the tangible and intangible assets of Cure TopCo that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The Tax Receivable Agreement requires Signify Health to pay to the TRA Parties 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize from the tax basis increase and other tax attributes discussed herein. Furthermore, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will give rise to additional tax benefits and therefore additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
