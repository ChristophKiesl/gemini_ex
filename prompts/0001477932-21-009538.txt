Item 1. Business.

Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 26, 2007. The Company is headquartered in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The Company’s mission is to advance the technology of tissue culture science and to provide the highest quality 100% germ free, disease free and all genetically the same plantlets of high CBD hemp and other flora and offering full spectrum DNA testing for plant identification, live genetics preservation using low temperature storage for various cannabis and horticulture plants; extraction of botanical oils mainly CBD oil, and to deliver laboratory based services to the North American high CBD hemp, Cannabis and agriculture sectors.

Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. However, if the Company is unable to raise additional capital in the near future, due to the Company’s liquidity problems, management expects that the Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek additional capital on less favourable terms and/or pursue other remedial measures. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company has decided that immediate business development in the hemp and cannabis industries provides a much greater opportunity in the United States. The project at Deroche has been placed on hold while the Company moves forward to build out a similar infrastructure planned for Deroche within the United States.

On July 25th 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to acquire all the assets and cannabis business operation (includes 12 acres property, structure and cannabis licenses, existing sales channels and distribution networks) from a private company situated in Northern California. Upon reaching a definitive agreement, the Company intends to further develop a state-of-the-art flowering greenhouse of approximately 12,000 square feet or the maximum allowed by California State and Regional County. The acquisition price is $2.4 million to be paid through a combination of cash and shares. The Company also has an option from the seller to acquire an additional 120 acres or more of land for business expansion and development. The Company currently lacks funds with which to consummate the contemplated transaction and has not negotiated a definitive agreement with respect to the contemplated transaction. Thus, there is no assurance that the Company will ever enter into, and consummate, a definitive agreement with respect to the contemplated transaction.

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, disruptions of financial markets, and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to the Company’s supply chain, operations, and customer demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and could further impact the Company’s operations and the operations of the Company’s suppliers and vendors as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s customers, suppliers, and vendors and the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The management team is closely following the progression of COVID-19 and its potential impact on the Company. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results.

On April 12, 2018, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with WFS Pharmagreen Inc., a private company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of WFS Pharmagreen Inc. in exchange for 37,704,500 shares of common stock of the Company. Upon completion of this transaction, the shareholders of WFS Pharmagreen hold 95.5% of voting control of the Company.

Immediately prior to closing of the Agreement, the majority shareholder of the Company was also the majority shareholder of WFS. As a result of the common ownership upon closing of the transaction, the acquisition was considered a common-control transaction and was outside the scope of the business combination guidance in ASC 805-50. The entities are deemed to be under common control as of February 27, 2018, which was the date that the majority shareholder acquired control of the Company and, therefore, held control over both companies. On May 2, 2018, the Share Exchange Agreement was effected. In connection with this transaction, the Company changed its name on May 8, 2018 to Pharmagreen Biotech Inc. and changed its year end from April 30th to September 30th.

Our principal executive offices are temporarily located at 2987 Blackbear Court, Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Our telephone number is (702-803-9404). Our internet address is www.pharmagreen.ca.

On August 7, 2020, our company (including our subsidiaries) filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada, Case No. 20-13886.

On October 9, 2020, a stay order was lifted by a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on an action filed by a lender. This effectively removed the Company from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and protection.

We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next 12 months. We do not expect to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses, and we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to execute our plan of operations for at least the next twelve months. We will need to obtain additional financing, through equity security sales, debt instruments and private financing, to conduct our day-to-day operations, and to fully execute our business plan. We plan to raise the capital necessary to fund our business through the sale of equity securities, debt instruments or private financing. These factors raise substantial doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This report does not reflect all the adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
