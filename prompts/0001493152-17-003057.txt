Future Plan
 
As mentioned previously our future plans include expanding to the appeal of the global market. In order to do so we will continue our marketing campaign through social media but plan to hire increased employees to support more online interaction with potential customers. We also plan to advertise online through physical advertisements that a user may be able to click on to learn more about us and our products. We believe we will need to hire an additional 4-5 employees to implement the aforementioned plan to increase our marketing presence. In additional to day to day operations we also plan to allocate funds to developing new product lines that may be more appealing to other markets. Such development will require market research and testing of physical products for overall effectiveness, not to mention approval by respective regulatory bodies in the areas such products will be sold. At this time, we have not yet identified the exact costs of obtaining approval to release particular kinds of products, and we can only estimate the costs of such, as well as the cost it will cost to both develop and release new products into the marketplace.
 
We plan to undergo a few mergers and acquisitions (M&A) with companies that create synergy effects with us. We combine certain natural relationship marketing synergies and enables the combined companies to increase the profitability by integration of technology research and cost saving. Our targeted M&A companies are from, but limited to, healthcare, bio-technology, beauty slimming and wellness, food science and related industries.
 
Marketing 
 
Our marketing strategies are tailored for different group of clients in term of regions, countries, genders and cultures. Currently, we are selling our products in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. By identifying the correct needs for each region, we can engage our customers more effectively and efficient.
 
In order to be successful in expanding client base, DSwiss uses various online marketing platforms to spread awareness of our services and find interested customers. In addition, we use more traditional methods by placing advertisements in print and paper magazines and newspapers. Once a sizeable client base has been acquired it is important that every single one feel that they are a priority to our company and to that end we intend to increase our staff as our workload increases to ensure that every customer is receiving exemplary service and sufficient attention for their varying needs.
 
Our expected growth is planned to occur primarily through the implementation cross media marketing. This approach increases our brand exposure and consumer’s awareness through a combination of various media that blends into the customer’s lifestyles. Subsequently, customers’ loyalty is fostered. Presently, DSwiss already has a strong relationship with social media (eg. Facebook, Instagram and Wechat). The global presence social media has helped provide to us has been an invaluable resource, and as we continue to expand our business operations and spread our brand awareness we intend to primarily utilize social media to reach our customers. The benefits of social media are countless, but perhaps the most imperative to our future success is our ability to connect with customers directly, to receive their feedback almost instantaneously. On that note, the feedback we have received from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, which has helped us to create a robust brand image.
 
Competition
 
The industry in which DSwiss competes is highly competitive. Many Companies offer similar beauty products and services. We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out operations and marketing efforts. We hope to maintain our competitive advantage by utilizing the experience, knowledge, and expertise of our current staff as well as offering exemplary our customer service.
