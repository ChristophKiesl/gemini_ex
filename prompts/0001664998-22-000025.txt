Item 1. Business
Overview
KnowBe4, Inc. (the “Company” or “KnowBe4”) has developed the leading security awareness platform enabling organizations to assess, monitor and minimize the ongoing cybersecurity threat of social engineering attacks. We are pioneering an integrated approach to security awareness that incorporates cloud-based software, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and insights with engaging content. Our platform is purpose-built to drive awareness, change human behavior and enable a security-minded culture that results in a reduction of social engineering risks.
We believe every organization’s greatest asset is also its greatest security risk – its people. As investments in security products grow significantly, attackers are increasingly leveraging social engineering to circumvent the traditional layers of cybersecurity defense. Social engineering relies on the manipulation of human behavior and can range from enlisting unsuspecting employees in schemes to defraud their employers to gaining access to systems during the initial phase of broader, multi-stage cyberattacks that can result in devastating breaches. Because these attacks are low-cost and high-volume and have a high probability of success, they enable the attacker to achieve a significant return on investment. Social engineering represents a universal cybersecurity risk, as it specifically targets the employees rather than the infrastructure of an organization. As such, social engineering risks affect every organization, regardless of the sophistication of their security infrastructure.
Historically, organizations have invested significantly in cybersecurity defenses with the belief that infrastructure-centric tools alone could provide adequate protection. Despite significant amounts spent each year, security breaches continue to be reported with increasing frequency. Additionally, recent trends, including globally distributed workforces, work from home and the technological complexity of the modern digital workplace have vastly expanded the attack surface. A single click on a phishing email, insecure disposal of a sensitive document, use of a weak password and a host of other employee behaviors can prove disastrous to an organization. These effects are far-reaching, ranging from incident response costs and lost productivity to negative media coverage, loss of revenue and impacted customer confidence. More often than not, the difference between a secure and insecure interaction comes down to human behavior.
We believe security awareness is the most effective way for organizations to manage the unaddressed risk of social engineering. Security awareness has historically been isolated to information security and IT professionals and focused on compliance and simplistic content delivery. Our platform is designed to promote awareness, change human behavior and drive a security-minded culture. The foundation of our security awareness platform combines 
automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and continuous testing with data analysis and relevant and interactive content. Our products enable customers to strengthen their overall security posture by creating a security-minded culture characterized by active user participation with a focus on mitigating the human element of security risk across their entire organization. We enable organizations to effectively enhance the security awareness of their workforce, converting their employees into a critical last line of defense against cyberattacks.
Our platform currently includes:
•Security Awareness: enables continuous assessment of employees through simulated social engineering attacks across multiple mediums and remediation through real-time delivery of highly engaging modules that are curated based on relevant and specific risks;
•Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR): enables security professionals to prioritize and automate security workstreams in order to respond to and remediate social engineering attacks; and
•Governance, Risk and Compliance: enables organizations to analyze security risk and automate the management of compliance and audit functions.
We designed our platform to meet the needs of IT administrators, as effective, scalable, quick to deploy and easy to use for organizations of all sizes. Our platform design allows us to scale from small businesses to large enterprises and our products are deployed on a common data platform with embedded analytical tools and reporting APIs, resulting in seamless integration. Additionally, our products are designed to bring substantial amounts of data into an organization’s existing security stack allowing our customers to continually assess and monitor ongoing risks to the organization. With our recent acquisition of SecurityAdvisor, we believe we will be able to address an entirely new category of risk associated with human behavior through the introduction of Human Detection and Response or HDR. Through integrations with an organizations’ existing security layers, we expect to be able to take real-time corrective action against insecure human behaviors based on data obtained through existing technical security controls.
As the behavior of any employee could represent a threat, our customers tend to adopt our platform across the entire organization to protect all employees from social engineering threats. We have developed an effective go-to-market strategy that has been proven to help us reach both small and midsized businesses and large enterprises. We employ an efficient inside sales model that translates across all customer segments, complimented by channel partnerships that provide significant sales leverage and have enabled us to further penetrate the enterprise market.
Key Strengths of Our Platform
We provide an integrated platform that enables organizations to assess, monitor and mitigate the persistent threat of social engineering. Our cloud-based platform employs a differentiated combination of software, machine learning, artificial intelligence, analytics, insights, content and security workstreams that is designed to meaningfully impact human behavior and continually improve an organization’s security posture in response to social engineering threats. The key strengths of our platform include:
Targeted Focus on Human Behavior
Our platform is exclusively focused on human behavior, as we believe that elevating the security awareness of an organization’s employees is essential to managing the risk associated with social engineering. We believe that infrastructure-based security controls alone are inadequate, requiring humans to become the critical last line of defense for an organization. In growing the category for security awareness, we are focused on building a platform capable of changing insecure behaviors and reinforcing secure behaviors of individuals. This allows us to invest in technology and development resources to drive innovation and differentiation in products designed to address the human layer of security. We believe our focus has helped us establish market leadership and will position us favorably to capitalize on market opportunities as the scope of the human layer of security expands.
Continuous Intelligence and Analytics
Our platform continuously assesses users and monitors social engineering risk, creating an active feedback loop that enables organizations to drive improvements in employee security awareness and overall security posture. Frequent training, knowledge checks and behavior-based intervention all reinforce secure behaviors and provide critical data for measuring, improving and maintaining security awareness within an organization. 
The advanced analytics delivered by our platform enable security administrators to identify, monitor and manage the social engineering risk of the organization as a whole, or of individual employees or groups of employees. Our platform analyzes a broad and extensive set of risk data to assess the level of social engineering risks within an organization and provides security professionals with actionable insights to modify and improve security awareness programs based on risk profiles at the individual or group level. Through the learner experience dashboard, our platform also provides employees visibility into their individual susceptibility to social engineering threats, which promotes continuous engagement and improvement in security awareness.
Effective and Efficient Security Awareness Administration
Our platform is designed to enable security administrators to mitigate social engineering risk through automated, machine learning-driven administration of training specifically customized to an individual user or group of users. The platform analyzes users’ behavior and allows organizations to categorize employees based on dynamic or custom groupings to tailor simulated social engineering campaigns, assignments and analytical reporting based on identified potential vulnerabilities. Our platform leverages a machine learning engine to provide administrators with targeted recommendations based on the results of simulated tests and users’ risk scores prompting the delivery of relevant content designed to reduce the risks associated with social engineering.
The platform also includes embedded SOAR functionality to prioritize and automate security operations related to user-reported social engineering threats. With these capabilities, security professionals can minimize risk to the organization by quickly responding to and effectively remediating the most severe social engineering threats. All together, these capabilities are designed to reduce the administrative burden of security awareness management and operations on resource-constrained IT and security professionals. 
Expansive Library of Engaging and Effective Content
We have built an expansive library of differentiated security awareness content that is continuously refreshed to ensure that our offerings always reflect the expanding range of social engineering threats. We leverage our extensive proprietary data set on human behavior and social engineering attacks, first-party threat environment research and crowd-sourcing methods to update our simulated threat templates, in order to convincingly emulate real-world social engineering methods.
We believe the range and sophistication of our content library and technology makes our platform highly effective in changing human behavior to reduce social engineering risk. We employ dedicated content centers of excellence across geographies to produce differentiated content that reflects themes based on the broader global threat environment, but is highly localized and culturally relevant. The breadth and scope of our content enables it to fully meet the needs of large global enterprises with geographically diverse workforces, driving increased customer satisfaction and retention.
Ease of Platform Deployment and Use 
We have designed our platform to be easy to deploy and use, enabling our customers to achieve rapid time-to-value and cost efficiency in security awareness operations. Our cloud-based platform requires minimal implementation efforts, enabling customers to quickly onboard and complete an initial baseline simulated social engineering campaign. We have also developed integrations with mainstream identity platforms, including Active Directory and SCIM, that further streamline platform deployment and ongoing user administration. Our management console offers simple and automated administration of security awareness programs and related workstreams, reducing the resource and expertise requirements on the organization. For employees, the user interface of our platform has also been designed to deliver an intuitive, easy-to-use and high quality experience. 
Designed to Serve the Entire Market
The ability to scale our technology to meet the needs of all organizations has been a central tenet of our platform design philosophy from the beginning. As a result, we have designed our products to be both accessible to smaller organizations without dedicated IT departments and scalable to organizations with hundreds of thousands of users and multiple security teams dispersed across the world. Our cloud-based delivery model, scalable multi-tenant architecture and global content centers of excellence allow us to regularly introduce new content and platform features to our customers quickly and seamlessly.
Our Market Opportunity
We estimate the total market opportunity for our platform currently to be approximately $23.0 billion. For our KMSAT, PhishER and Compliance Plus products, we calculate our market opportunity by applying a per employee price by size of business, based on internally generated customer spend data, to an estimated total number of employees across over 50 addressable geographies. For KCM, in the U.S., we apply an average contract value to a set number of organizations using internally generated customer spend data. Internationally, we estimate the size of the market as a multiple of the U.S. market. Our total market opportunity also includes an estimate of the market opportunity related to our future product that will be developed utilizing technology obtained through our acquisition of SecurityAdvisor and integrated into our platform. The sum of the calculated values across KMSAT, PhishER, Compliance Plus, KCM and our future product, as described herein, represents our total estimated market opportunity. 
Our Growth Strategy
We believe we have significant opportunities to extend our market leadership. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
Expand Our Customer Base 
We believe there is a significant opportunity to invest in our sales and marketing activities to drive broader market knowledge of the importance of security awareness. Increasing category awareness of our market enables us to expand our customer base with less education effort and more efficient go-to-market execution. We believe that businesses of all sizes are exposed to the risks of social engineering and that there is a large opportunity to help both small and medium sized businesses (“SMBs”), and large enterprises defend against this threat. In addition to growing the small to medium sized customer base that we have focused on since inception, we believe that there is significant opportunity to increase penetration in the enterprise segment, which we define as customers with 1,000 or more employees.
Expand Internationally 
The international market represents an expansion opportunity for us. To pursue this opportunity, we are rapidly expanding our international operations and increasing our physical presence through headcount additions in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and South America. We are also investing in further localizing our platform through foreign language translation and customized content. Our platform is currently accessible in over 30 languages and we plan to expand this language support in the future, along with increasing our region-specific content offerings.
Grow Our Partner Network
We plan to increase our channel partnerships to help us efficiently reach new territories and opportunities. Growing our international channel partnerships will help us reach new jurisdictions where we have not yet developed extensive brand awareness and local customer relationships. We believe managed service providers or MSPs, and channel partners represent an efficient way to sell to smaller customers, as organizations with limited or no IT departments often rely on MSPs to provide specialized security skills or knowledge. As our business becomes more mature, we believe the revenue contribution from channel partners and MSPs will continue to increase.
Expand Our Existing Customer Relationships 
We plan to continue cross-selling products and upselling subscription tiers within our existing customer base. Our extensive existing customer base provides substantial opportunity to expand use of our platform offerings as well as upgrade existing subscriptions to higher tiers. We believe that our integrated platform and the strength of our customer success program are key to our ability to cross-sell and upsell to our existing customers. We plan to create new adjacencies and use cases through investments in our technology and platform and customer success personnel to retain existing customers and drive increased product attachment rates.
Invest in Our Platform and Content
We believe that continued investment in our technology platform and content is important to our ability to maintain and extend our market leadership. We invest in technology and development activities to continuously strengthen our platform and release additional features and products to the market. These development efforts stay true to our core principles that the human layer in cybersecurity is important and that the human layer can be addressed without adding significant complexity to the end user or IT security professional. We believe that our ability to leverage the immense amount of data collected from our customers’ usage and to incorporate their feedback into our platform and content offerings have contributed to our market-leading position. We continue to explore methods to monetize our data assets in the future and to integrate customer feedback into future product development opportunities.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 
We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our existing platform, enhance our technology and our content, and increase the value proposition we deliver to our customers. For example, we may pursue acquisitions that we believe will help us add new features, accelerate customer growth, enter new markets and add talent and expertise to our organization.
Our Platform
The KnowBe4 security awareness platform consists of:
•Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training, or KMSAT, our security awareness training product, which enables continuous assessment of employees through simulated social engineering attacks across multiple mediums and remediation through real-time delivery of highly engaging modules that are curated based on relevant and specific risks;
•Compliance Plus, our compliance training product, which enables organizations to provide their employees with relevant, timely and engaging compliance content across a broad range of topics from data privacy to diversity, equity and inclusion;

•KnowBe4 Compliance Manager, or KCM, our governance, risk and compliance product, which enables organizations to analyze security risk and automate the management of compliance and audit functions.
All of our products are built on a cloud-based architecture designed to be easy to deploy across organizations of all sizes. We also build machine learning and artificial intelligence into our products to increase the product’s ability to enable behavioral change and to allow the administration of our products to be streamlined and efficient.
Our platform features integrated capabilities that are designed to enhance the overall value proposition to our customers and their employees. Through advanced analytics and risk scoring capabilities, our platform enables customers to proactively identify social engineering risk within their organizations. When a customer is onboarded, our platform provides a baseline risk assessment based on the performance of individual users in an initial simulated phishing campaign. Based on the risk assessment, our platform can enable the automatic administration of high quality, effective training aimed at mitigating identified risk. Organizations are then able to continuously simulate a 
wide array of social engineering attacks, giving users the ability to fail safely, adjust their behavior and learn through action. This continuous cycle creates an active feedback loop and increases engagement which helps prevent users from reverting to risky behavior.
As users become more effective at identifying and reporting potential social engineering attacks, our orchestration, automation and response capabilities help security professionals efficiently manage the workstreams associated with user-reported threats. We leverage a vast repository of proprietary data gathered from user-reported threats that have bypassed infrastructure-based security defenses to evolve our platform, automation capabilities and security content to reflect the latest threat environment. Our dataset continually expands and becomes more valuable as the number of users on the platform and the security awareness of those users increase. This greatly enhances our ability to leverage the data derived from our customer base in improving our platform.
Our platform’s underlying features and capabilities include AI and machine learning, advanced analytics, risk scoring, reporting dashboards and flexible APIs. Organizations utilize these tools to continuously assess the ongoing risk of social engineering, respond to these threats and ultimately automate the enterprise’s defense against human-based cyberattacks. We also offer several free tools that provide IT professionals with the ability to identify and respond to a wide range of social engineering threats as well as to assess general end-user security behaviors. These free tools provide us with lead generation capabilities to focus on exposing organizations to our platform in a cost-efficient way. The capabilities of these tools are distinct from our paid products and focus on highlighting the need for effective security awareness.
Our Products
Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training (KMSAT) 
Our flagship Security Awareness Training product, KMSAT, is named after our Chief Hacking Officer, Kevin Mitnick. Kevin’s history as a hacker and as a security consultant gave him unique insights into the social engineering techniques that are used by hackers to target employees and gain access to corporate networks, credentials and information. KMSAT has been recognized by independent industry research firms, including Gartner and Forrester Research, as a leader in Security Awareness Training.
KMSAT is a “new-school” security awareness product that combines automated phishing and social engineering simulation tests with engaging and curated content spanning across a variety of mediums, including email, SMS and voice. Our robust machine learning and data analytics capabilities allow our cyberattack simulations and training curriculum to automatically adapt to learner needs. We have developed advanced technological features including a full randomization feature that simulates the real world – every employee receives a random template at a random time, designed to eliminate the “prairie-dog effect” which occurs when co-workers alert each other of a test. Our patented Smart Groups feature allows organizations to categorize employees based on dynamic or custom groupings to tailor phishing campaigns, training assignments and analytical reporting. The data analysis capabilities offered by our Advanced Reporting features allow organizations to review the outcomes of social engineering and training campaigns across several dimensions and use enterprise-grade APIs to allow for customization of reports, integration with other business systems and ease of executive reporting.
We have also developed a machine learning engine that provides administrators with training recommendations based on the results of simulated social engineering tests and users’ risk scores. Our Virtual Risk Officer ingests and calculates data across a multitude of sources, evaluates the data using machine learning and provides dynamic Risk Scores — assigned to users, groups and organizations as a whole — empowering customers to make data-driven decisions. Calculated using both internal and external factors, including training history, simulation history, breach data and job function, the Risk Score is designed to measure how likely the user is to be targeted with a phishing or social engineering attack, how they would react to these types of events and how severe the consequences would be if they fell for an attack. The user Risk Score dashboard is continually updated to reflect the users’ completion of training and responses to simulated phishing emails, with the goal of providing an accurate view of the individual’s and organization’s overall susceptibility to social engineering attacks over time.
We believe we offer the world’s largest library of security awareness training with over a thousand items of content, including interactive modules, videos, games, posters and newsletters. Our content library is constantly 
being updated with new materials created based on the latest social engineering tactics. Our training portal is intuitive and easy to use, and the production value of our premium content is comparable to that of a TV series or film. 
KMSAT is offered on a SaaS subscription basis to serve the varying needs of our diverse customer base, from small businesses to large enterprises. We offer a range of subscription tiers at different pricing levels, which provide access to varying levels of functionality and content. Our basic tiers – Silver and Gold – offer access to features that are essential to an organization’s security awareness needs, including unlimited simulated social engineering tests, basic training content, machine learning-based individual security risk scoring and access to add-on features such as the Phish Alert button and phishing email reply tracking. Our Platinum tier provides users access to advanced reporting capabilities, such as reporting APIs and user event APIs, as well as advanced administrative functions, such as Smart Groups and Security Roles that help manage users, groups and various security roles within organizations. Our Platinum users also receive priority-level customer support. Our Diamond tier is our most popular subscription tier and includes access to our Artificial Intelligence-driven Agent, AIDA™, and additional pieces of premium content, including our award-winning The Inside Man series. The vast majority of our KMSAT customers subscribe to our Platinum and Diamond tiers.
Compliance Plus
The Compliance Plus product brings the “new-school” approach we pioneered with security awareness into the compliance market. Compliance Plus provides organizations’ employees with relevant and engaging content as well as training modules that address compliance topics ranging from data privacy to business ethics to diversity, equity and inclusion. Compliance Plus is accessible through the existing KnowBe4 platform which allows administrators access to robust, existing customization and automation features, such as automatic enrollment and advanced reporting. Additionally, we believe the Compliance Plus product will bring valuable behavioral data to our already data-rich platform, enabling organizations to further focus on mitigating risks presented by their employees. Compliance Plus is offered as a subscription that is paired with a customer’s new or existing KMSAT subscription.
PhishER 
PhishER was created to help security administrators deal with the influx of user-reported social engineering attacks from an employee base that was made increasingly knowledgeable with KMSAT. PhishER allows the IT security team to analyze suspected attacks that employees report by clicking the Phish Alert Button, or PAB, within their email applications. PhishER integrates with major email platforms and related mobile applications, including Microsoft Outlook, Office 365 and G Suite. PhishER continues the remediation work-cycle by providing security incident response teams with a powerful platform to analyze reported emails and respond to threats faster and more effectively.
We designed PhishER to give security teams the ability to evaluate reported threats by using standard prioritization rules embedded in the platform or by creating custom rules to more closely align to their individual organization’s needs. These rules are applied to reported threats to automatically categorize them into “Emergency Rooms.” PhishER Emergency Rooms are built into the platform to show security teams pre-filtered views of reported messages, allowing drill down capabilities to take bulk actions on groups of messages. PhishER leverages our PhishML machine learning engine to analyze, categorize, evaluate threat levels and respond to each reported threat.
A key to the success of PhishER is that the emails used to train PhishML have already made it through email filters and security gateways to land in the end-users’ inboxes. This means that the machine learning model is being fed a unique stream of data that other security measures have failed to address, thereby improving the model’s accuracy and allowing more automated prioritization and decisioning. If an email is determined to be a threat, PhishER searches and, if directed, quarantines similar messages across all inboxes in the organization. Matching messages present in other users’ inboxes are then queued for further analysis, quarantine, or permanent deletion via our PhishRIP feature, which seamlessly integrates with major email platforms. If the user-reported email is determined to be safe and legitimate, it can be returned to the user. We believe the PhishER platform allows the IT Security team to close-the-loop on social engineering with the end-user and protect the organization.
KnowBe4 Compliance Manager (KCM)
KCM was designed to help our customers save time and resources by providing an intuitive user interface with streamlined workflows that enables visibility into the ongoing audit and compliance processes at all levels of the business. To further simplify the user experience, we developed workflow templates that are applicable to a variety of common compliance needs, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), among others. These templates, along with the ability for users to create their own custom workflows, allow the KCM product to easily scale across a variety of different compliance needs and programs. A recent addition to the KCM product is the Vendor Risk Management module, which allows our customers to centralize their vendor management process. This includes the onboarding of new vendors in a streamlined manner and tracking a vendor’s compliance with policies and procedures throughout the vendor lifecycle. Additionally, KCM dashboards have been specifically designed with automated reminders to equip users with the tool in the timely completion and tracking of compliance activities.
Product Pipeline
Our current product pipeline includes Security Coach, our future product that will incorporate technology gained through the SecurityAdvisor acquisition to address human behavior risks through HDR. Security Coach will utilize a cloud interface to download and aggregate security alerts from our customers’ existing security products, analyze those alerts and provide actionable messages to users through standard email and messaging applications. These messages are designed to address insecure behaviors in real-time. Additionally, our product code-named PasswordIQ will be used to mitigate risk related to password hygiene issues, such as weak or breached passwords. This product will monitor security risks detected with users’ passwords, organize this risk data on a dashboard and facilitate automatic employee training based on the risks identified. 
Free Tools
As part of our go-to-market strategy, we offer a robust set of free tools that add value to our customers and help generate leads for our sales teams. Our free tools help users assess their security vulnerabilities and protect themselves against emerging security threats and challenges. Our strategy is to leverage the free tools as our lead generation engine to drive awareness, increase brand exposure and convert more users to long-term paying customers on our core products. Our free tools also provide important usage data and user feedback for our new product development. Oftentimes, we convert free tools into paid products after adding more functionalities. Our free tools include phishing tools, password tools, email security tools and other security awareness training tools. These tools are designed help organizations assess their vulnerability to various formats of phishing attacks, benchmark their security awareness levels, evaluate password-related risks, assess email-related security threats and help IT teams create and deploy security awareness programs. 
Competition
We operate within the broader cybersecurity market and we believe we are one of the only companies that is primarily focused on the human layer of cybersecurity. The security awareness market is largely a greenfield market. Certain larger enterprise providers attempt to address the security awareness market through their own infrastructure-centric product offerings; however, these offerings are often tied to other products within their portfolio and do not focus on changing human behavior. While there are some smaller security awareness focused companies in the market, none have grown to a meaningful scale to be considered a material competitor.
We believe that we compete primarily on the following factors: 
•our ability to provide an integrated platform for organizations to assess, monitor and mitigate the persistent threat of social engineering;
•the incorporation of artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation and integrations into our platform;
•the overall strength of our sales, marketing and channel relationships;
•our brand awareness and reputation within the market;
•the perceived value of our products relative to the subscription cost;
•the quality and breadth of our content offerings; and
•our ability to provide a seamless customer experience for both IT personnel and individual users of our platform within the organization.
Although certain of our competitors may enjoy greater resources and recognition and customer relationships outside of security awareness, we believe that we compete favorably within our market with respect to these factors. 
Customers
We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large company that has an active contract with us to access our platform. As security awareness is a fundamental need for all organizations, we represent virtually all industry verticals. We have experienced success in industries where cybersecurity is of particular importance, such as financial services, technology, professional services, healthcare and the public sector. Additionally, we have received Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, authorization to sell our KMSAT product to federal government agencies. We plan to apply for additional FedRAMP certifications for other products on our platform in the future. None of our customers accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. In addition, we do not have any material dependencies on any specific product, service or particular group or groups.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We operate an inside sales model as well as a network of MSPs and channel partners, both domestically and internationally. Our inside sales representatives and partners are collectively responsible for our initial customer acquisition. Customers typically deploy our platform to their entire end user base upon initial subscription. We utilize our team of customer success managers to ensure onboarding to our platform and help drive adoption of additional features and products. Dedicated pricing specialists are tasked with negotiating customer renewals, along with upselling and cross-selling. Our cloud-based platform enables our inside sales team to seamlessly upgrade subscription tiers and activate additional products on behalf of customers. Additionally, we offer transparent and competitive pricing, which we believe translates into an efficient sales cycle.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is highly focused on demand generation driving our opportunity pipeline. This strategy is intended to be applied broadly across all organization sizes and industries; however, some verticals like finance, healthcare and manufacturing have been exceptionally receptive. We offer over a dozen free tools that add value to our customers and help generate leads for our sales teams. Many of these tools integrate directly into our platform to provide additional layers of intelligence and risk data to our customers. These tools increase our sales velocity and are a testing ground for future paid products on our platform. Additionally, we run hundreds of webcasts annually, participate in cybersecurity industry events and utilize our product evangelist team to drive market awareness. We anticipate further building our marketing team and are investing in channel relationships to further penetrate up-market accounts.
Research and Development
Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing and quality of our cloud-based platform. In addition to improving on our features and functionality, this team works to ensure that our platform is available, reliable and stable. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform features and functionalities and develop new products designed to expand our presence in the security awareness market. We believe the timely development of new features and the enhancement of our existing platform 
is essential to maintaining our competitive position. Our research and development team works closely with our customer success team to collect user feedback to enhance our development process as we continually incorporate suggestions and feedback from our customers into our platform. We also believe our research and development teams’ focus on developing new products that address the continuously evolving risks of social engineering and security awareness will help us maintain our market leading position. We utilize an agile development process to deliver numerous releases, fixes and feature updates each year and capitalize qualifying costs of developing larger scale projects. Our research and development team is primarily based in Clearwater, Florida, but we continue to build out additional research and development capabilities in certain international jurisdictions who supplement our core team.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, protection and security, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, economic sanctions, immigration, federal securities, and tax. In addition, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with our customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, which affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Additional laws and regulations relating to these areas likely will be passed in the future, and these or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted or enforced in new or expanded manners, each of which could result in significant limitations on how we operate our business. New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, offerings or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional platform functionalities and offerings, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements and costs may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
See the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the subsections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Taxation—Complying with evolving privacy and other data related laws and requirements may be expensive and force us to make adverse changes to our business, and failure to comply with such laws and requirements could result in substantial harm to our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Taxation—We are subject to laws and regulations, including governmental export and import controls, sanctions, anti-boycott regulations and anti-corruption laws that could impair our ability to compete in our markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Taxation—Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Taxation—Sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 71 issued patents in the United States, 62 patent applications pending in the United States and 5 patent applications pending internationally. Our issued patents expire between February 2037 and September 2040, and 3 of our pending patent applications have been allowed. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and 
frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third-parties may also claim that our security platform and other products infringe their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees.
Human Capital Resources
Our corporate culture is built on the goal of creating an environment where employees feel safe, feel they belong, in an inclusive team environment where they can rise to their full potential, and deliver their top performance in a sane, fun work environment. We strive to reach this goal by placing a focus on recruiting team-oriented, hardworking individuals, training those individuals, developing strong teams and creating an organized, efficient workplace. We believe that retaining employees who consistently contribute to the organization’s success in measurable ways is key to sustaining strong teams. We drive employee retention through our market-based compensation philosophy and the adoption of a holistic employee benefits package. In addition, our strong commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion has fostered a highly collaborative and motivated workforce. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,366 full-time employees, of which 264 were located outside the United States.
Culture and Employee Engagement
We recognize that people are at the heart of our success and we leverage the broad diversity of our teams’ knowledge and identities to build quality products that reflect the collective experience of our users and surrounding communities. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by recent awards including the 2022 Top Workplaces USA award for our size category, which was based solely on employee feedback, 2021 Fortune Best Workplaces for Women and Millennials and 2021 Mogul Top 100 Workplaces for D&I Initiatives, among others. We receive feedback on our culture directly from our employees through our annual, anonymous employee engagement survey. We also monitor external feedback, such as Glassdoor, where we were named on Glassdoor’s 2021 list of “Best Places to Work”.
Recruitment and Talent Development
As part of our recruiting initiatives, we sponsor several scholarship opportunities, including scholarships focused on increasing the presence of women, military veterans and other historically underrepresented minorities within the cybersecurity industry. We also sponsor various development programs to assist with our recruitment efforts including both sales-focused and technical-focused career development programs and internships focused on providing practical skills. training and relevant work experience.
We believe that a positive onboarding experience is foundational to positive employee engagement and rapid productivity. Our onboarding process is dedicated to ensuring all employees understand our culture, policies and products. We focus on the continuous education of our entire employee base by providing opportunities for real-time learning.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract and retain our leading talent, including overall team incentive bonuses and stock compensation. We also offer a wide range of health and well-being programs designed to meet our employees’ physical and mental needs. We believe fair pay is essential to our ability to attract and motivate the highly qualified and diverse employees who are at the center of our current and future success.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We understand the work needed to support and foster a culture of inclusivity and belonging. This is continuous and relies on our three components of (1) building diverse workforces and the accompanying knowledge bases to support our employees, (2) conquering bias, discrimination and inequity, and (3) celebrating diversity and all the intersections of identities that make us who we are. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion programs continue to advance a culture of inclusivity. We have seven employee resource groups or ERGs, including Knowster Parents, Black Knowsters Network, Women in Technology, LGBTQIA+, LatinX, Asian and Asian Pacific Islanders and the Military and Veterans Resource Group, which are employee-led groups that play a vital role in building understanding and awareness. The diversity of our workforce is an example of this vision in action. In 2021, females represented 40.6% of our workforce and approximately 25% of our workforce was made up of underrepresented groups, which we define as employees who identify as Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Multiracial, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. 
We have also created four “Start” programs which allow individuals from underrepresented groups or non-traditional backgrounds to transition into our technical support, customer success and research and development teams. These programs are (1) Jump Start, for high school or GED graduates, (2) Re-Start, for individuals looking for a career change, (3) New Start, for members of the military transitioning into civilian life, and (4) Code Start, for individuals interested in engineering careers who do not have traditionally required experience. 
Sustainability and Environmental Responsibilities
We take environmental responsibility seriously and are committed to sustainability for the good of our customers, employees and the planet. We are committed to doing our part to reduce environmental impacts of our business. In 2021, we committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions across our business by 2040, to increase our use of clean, renewable energy to at least 25% for all of our offices globally by 2025 and to reach an overall annual average waste diversion rate of 80% in 2022 and 90% by 2023. We also value our role as a good corporate citizen and are dedicated to making a positive social impact through various employee-led initiatives.
