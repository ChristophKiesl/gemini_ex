Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. We are developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as RVT-1401), that selectively binds to and inhibits the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (“FcRn”). IMVT-1401 is the product of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. (“HanAll”) to design a highly potent anti-FcRn antibody optimized for subcutaneous delivery. We obtained rights to IMVT-1401 pursuant to our license agreement (the “HanAll Agreement”) with HanAll. Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, we will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties, including up to an aggregate of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. We are also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement. 
Our product candidate has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, IMVT-1401 has been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe IMVT-1401 has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. We intend to develop IMVT-1401 in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit. 
Autoimmune diseases are conditions where an immune response is inappropriately directed against the body’s own healthy cells and tissues. According to a 2012 study by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from one of more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Predisposing factors may include genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers and other factors not yet known. Many of these diseases are associated with high levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies, which are the most abundant type of antibody produced by the human immune system, accounting for approximately 75% of antibodies in the plasma of healthy people. IgG antibodies are important in the defense against pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. In many autoimmune diseases, IgG antibodies inappropriately develop against normal proteins found in the body, directing the immune system to attack specific organs or organ systems.
Unfortunately, safe and effective treatment options for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases are lacking. Currently available treatments are generally limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in early-stage disease and intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIg”) or plasma exchange in later-stage disease. These approaches often fail to address patients’ needs since they are limited by delayed onset of action, waning therapeutic benefit over time and unfavorable safety profiles.
FcRn plays a pivotal role in preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies. The physiologic function of FcRn is to modulate the catabolism of IgG antibodies, and inhibition of FcRn, such as through use of an anti-FcRn antibody, has been shown to reduce levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies. Completed clinical trials of Immunovant and other anti-FcRn antibodies in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases have generated promising results, suggesting that FcRn is a therapeutically important pharmacologic target to reduce levels of these disease-causing IgG antibodies.
In several nonclinical studies and a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, intravenous and subcutaneous delivery of IMVT-1401 demonstrated dose-dependent IgG antibody reductions and was observed to be generally well tolerated. In the highest dose cohort from the multiple-ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, four weekly subcutaneous administrations of 680 mg resulted in a mean maximum reduction of serum IgG levels of 78%, with a standard deviation of 2%. IMVT-1401 was generally well-tolerated in this study and the majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during these Phase 1 clinical trials of IMVT-1401. Injection site reactions were similar between IMVT-1401 and placebo arms.
We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule as discussed below. As a result of our rational design, we believe that IMVT-1401, if developed and approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases, (e.g., Myasthenia Gravis (“MG”), Thyroid Eye Disease (“TED”, formerly referred to as Graves’ Ophthalmopathy, or “GO”), Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (“WAIHA”), Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, Bullous Pemphigoid, Neuromyelitis Optica, Pemphigus Foliaceus, Guillain-Barré Syndrome and PLA2R+ Membranous Nephropathy). In 2020, these diseases had an aggregate prevalence of approximately 278,000 patients in the United States and 480,000 patients in Europe.
The estimated prevalence of certain IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases are set forth in the following table:
 | Estimated Prevalence (2020)
Indication | U.S. | Europe*
Myasthenia Gravis | 66,000 | | 104,000
Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia | 42,000 | | 67,000 
Thyroid Eye Disease | 33,000 | | 52,000 
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura | 65,000 | | 140,000
Pemphigus Vulgaris | 28,000 | | 45,000 
Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy | 16,000 | | 25,000 
Bullous Pemphigoid | 8,000 | | 13,000 
Neuromyelitis Optica | 7,000 | | 12,000 
Pemphigus Foliaceus | 7,000 | | 11,000 
Guillain-Barré Syndrome | 4,000 | | 7,000 
PLA2R+ Membranous Nephropathy | 2,000 | | 4,000 
Total | 278,000 | | 480,000

To the extent we choose to develop IMVT-1401 for certain of these rare diseases, we plan to seek orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe, where applicable. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. However, we have not yet obtained such designation for any of our target indications, and there is no certainty that we will obtain such designation, or maintain the benefits associated with such designation if we do obtain it.
We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection, and have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, WAIHA and TED. We are also pursuing a series of other indications. MG is an autoimmune disease associated with muscle weakness with an estimated prevalence of one in 5,000, with up to 66,000 cases in the United States. In MG, patients develop pathogenic IgG antibodies that attack critical signaling proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells. The majority of MG patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness, with maximum weakness occurring within six months of disease onset in most patients. In severe cases, MG patients can experience myasthenic crisis, in which respiratory function is weakened to the point where it becomes life-threatening, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial, a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in patients with moderate-to-severe MG. After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The trial is now completed. See “IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis” below for further discussion. 
WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells (“RBCs”). Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 42,000 patients in the United States and 67,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body’s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. In August 2020, we initiated dosing for ASCEND WAIHA, our Phase 2, open-label, sequential, two cohort clinical trial in patients with WAIHA. In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401. Because the ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label trial, the pause did not necessitate study termination but rather a suspension. See “Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs” below for further discussion.
TED is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. TED has an estimated annual incidence of 16 in 100,000 women and 2.9 in 100,000 men in North America and Europe. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. In March 2020, we announced initial results from our ASCEND GO-1 trial, a Phase 2a open-label single-arm clinical trial in Canada in seven patients with TED. This trial is now completed. In October 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (“TSHR”). In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401. Because the pause led to unblinding ASCEND GO-2, this trial was terminated after the last patient completed the withdrawal visit and the follow-up visit. See “Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs” below for further discussion.
Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs
In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (“LDL”) levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. We have informed regulatory authorities and trial subjects and investigators of this voluntary pause of dosing in our studies that were ongoing at that time, ASCEND GO-2, our Phase 2b trial in Thyroid Eye Disease and ASCEND WAIHA, our Phase 2 trial in Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. 
Program-wide Review
In order to better characterize the observed lipid findings, we conducted from February 2021 through May 2021 a program-wide data review (including both clinical and nonclinical data) with input from external scientific and medical experts.
In our ASCEND GO-2 trial, lipid parameters were assessed at baseline, at week 12, and at week 20 following eight weeks off drug. Based on preliminary, unblinded data, median LDL cholesterol at week 12 was increased by approximately 12 mg/dL in the 255 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 15%), by approximately 33 mg/dL in the 340 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 37%), by approximately 62 mg/dL in the 680 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 52%) and did not increase in the control group. The data analysis indicates a dose-dependent increase in lipids. Average high-density lipoprotein (“HDL”) and triglyceride levels also increased but to a much lesser degree. We also observed correlated decreases in albumin levels and the rate and extent of albumin reductions were dose-dependent. Subjects receiving the 255 mg weekly dose (“QW”) experienced the smallest reductions in albumin through week 12, with a median reduction of about 16% from baseline, while subjects receiving the 340 mg or 680 mg QW dose experienced median reductions of albumin of 26% or 40%, respectively. At week 20, both lipids and albumin returned to baseline.
In our open label ASCEND WAIHA trial, only two subjects completed 12 weeks of dosing prior to the program-wide pause in dosing, with three additional subjects partially completing the dosing period. Pre-specified and post-hoc lipid test results from these five subjects were analyzed along with post-hoc lipid test results performed on frozen samples from ASCEND MG subjects (where available) and post-hoc lipid test results from our Phase 1 Injection Site study. LDL elevations observed in the ASCEND WAIHA and ASCEND MG subject populations and in healthy subjects in the Phase 1 Injection Site Study also appeared to be dose-dependent and were generally consistent in magnitude with the elevations observed in ASCEND GO-2 subjects. 
No major adverse cardiovascular events have been reported to date in IMVT-1401 clinical trials.
Integrated Safety Assessment and Regulatory Interactions
It is our intent to resume development across multiple indications for IMVT-1401. We are in the process of drafting multiple study protocols and updating our program-wide safety strategy for discussions with regulatory agencies. The elements of our development program will include extensive pharmacokinetic ("PK") and pharmacodynamic ("PD") modeling to select dosing regimens for IMVT-1401 which optimize reductions in total IgG levels while minimizing the impact on albumin and LDL levels, particularly for clinical studies containing long-term treatment extensions. These protocols will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities. While increases in LDL over an 8 to 12 week treatment duration would not be expected to pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of IMVT-1401 will need to incorporate any unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. Discussions with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, are expected to commence during the second half of the calendar year 2021.
Current Status of Our Clinical Trials
•Myasthenia Gravis: In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial, a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in patients with moderate-to-severe MG. After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The trial is now completed. Before the voluntary pause of dosing, we had a favorable end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA on the design of our Phase 3 registrational program in MG and we were planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. Based on our integrated safety analysis, we plan to meet with the FDA to propose further development to evaluate additional dosing levels and regimens as well as to include additional safety monitoring and considerations such as lipid and albumin monitoring and incorporating an independent safety monitoring committee. Contingent upon FDA feedback, we plan to initiate a pivotal study in MG late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022. 
•Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: Our ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label trial and we are planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. During the fall of 2021, we plan to commence discussions with the FDA on re-initiating this study, incorporating additional safety considerations and risk management as well as additional dosing regimens. We anticipate re-initiating this study based on a favorable outcome from these meetings late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022. 
•Thyroid Eye Disease: Our voluntary pause in dosing led to unblinding of the ASCEND GO-2 trial and this trial was terminated after the last patient completed the withdrawal visit and the follow-up visit. Treatment with IMVT-1401 reduced both IgG and disease specific pathogenic IgG over the 12-week treatment period. However, the efficacy results, based on approximately half the anticipated number of subjects who had reached the week 13 primary efficacy analysis at the time of the termination of the trial, were inconclusive. The primary endpoint of the proportion of proptosis responders was not met, and although not tested statistically, post hoc evaluation of other endpoints measured (Clinical Activity Score ("CAS") and diplopia scores) indicated the desired magnitude of treatment effect likely would not have been achieved. However, levels of IgG were reduced across IMVT-1401 dosing groups, and analysis of the receptor occupancy data suggest binding of IMVT-1401 to the Fc receptor. Additional exploratory work on other disease biomarkers is under evaluation. Further discussions with external experts are ongoing to determine whether a specific population can be identified to optimize the clinical performance of IMVT-1401. Based on these analyses, we are likely to design another Phase 2 trial in TED or another thyroid-related disease as our next study in this therapeutic area and initiate discussions with regulatory authorities before the end of the calendar year 2021.
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD)
The PK and PD (including serum concentrations of total IgG, albumin, and lipids) of IMVT-1401 were evaluated in healthy subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 1 Injection Site Study, and in patients with MG, TED and WAIHA in our ASCEND MG, ASCEND GO-1, ASCEND GO-2 and ASCEND WAIHA trials. Over the course of development, we have made significant progress in understanding the PK profiles, PD responses, and PK/PD relationships for IMVT-1401. In addition, we have established preliminary population PK and population PK/PD models using pooled data from all clinical studies to better understand and predict the PK and PD properties associated with various treatment regimens across different populations. 
To date, single doses of IMVT-1401 ranged from 100 mg to 1530 mg IV and 1.5 mg/kg to 765 mg and were administered by subcutaneous injections (“SC”) to healthy subjects. Multiple doses of 255 mg, 340 mg, and 680 mg SC QW have been studied in healthy subjects (up to 4 weeks of dosing) and patients with TED, MG, or WAIHA (up to 12 weeks of dosing). Based on preliminary data from our ASCEND GO-2 trial in TED, drug concentrations achieved after 680 mg SC QW resided predominantly in the linear elimination phase of the PK profile and were estimated to maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals in most subjects. The mean maximal reduction of total IgG achieved with maximal target engagement was approximately 80% and was achieved after 7 weeks of dosing. Drug concentrations achieved with 255 mg or 340 mg SC QW did not maintain target saturation throughout the dosing intervals in the majority of subjects; total IgG levels continued to decrease and were reduced by median Emax of approximately 62% and 69%, respectively, at the end of the 12-week dosing period. The shoulder region of the dose-response curve for reduction in total IgG was covered and observed. Within the dose range studied, the rate and extent of albumin reductions and lipid elevations were dose-dependent across different populations. Over a 12-week dosing period, median Emax of albumin reductions were approximately 16%, 26%, 40% and median increases in LDL were approximately 15%, 37% and 52% for the 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg SC QW doses, respectively. The lipid elevations were highly correlated with albumin reductions. Unlike the PK/PD relationship for total IgG, the shoulder region of the dose-response curves for reduction in albumin and increases in LDL were not clearly observed. Total IgG, albumin, and lipids levels returned to baseline within eight weeks after the last dose of a 12-week treatment.
Comprehensive understanding of the PK and PD characteristics of IMVT-1401 has enabled creation of robust mathematical models to support the selection of future dosing regimens. The discordance between the PK/PD response relationship for IgG and that of albumin or LDL suggests options for dosing regimens that provide potentially effective reductions in total IgG (and pathologic autoantibodies) while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL levels. Optimized dosing regimens, if shown to be effective, could improve the risk/benefit profile of IMVT-1401 while the ease of administration of our current formulation could enhance the overall patient experience.
Potential New Indications
We continue to evaluate potential new indications for IMVT-1401 by considering a number of factors including, but not limited to, degree of unmet need, degree of potential benefit offered by the treatment, safety-related parameters, target patient population size, likely duration of dosing and commercial potential.
We have identified many attractive first-in-class indications with high unmet need and scientific rationale for anti-FcRn therapy. In our studies to date, we learned that IMVT-1401 has the potential to be more effective than we expected at providing therapeutic relief for patients across a broad range of indications. We also believe that certain indications with existing anti-FcRn programs also offer a significant opportunity to provide unique patient benefit and therefore a strong commercial opportunity. Accordingly, we plan to announce two new indications and submit INDs and our trial designs to the FDA over the next 12 months. For competitive reasons, we will likely announce these indications only after we have agreement with the FDA that we may proceed with a planned protocol. We believe that one or two of these new indications will involve a new phase 2 program whereas one of our new indications can begin with a pivotal study in 2022.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet need. To execute our strategy, we plan to:
•Maximize the probability of success of IMVT-1401. We plan to leverage IMVT-1401’s differentiated profile in target indications where the anti-FcRn mechanism has already established clinical proof-of-concept. We intend to identify and target a variety of IgG-mediated autoimmune indications based on the following factors:
◦Insufficient benefit of the standard of care;
◦Disease severity that warrants novel therapies;
◦Ability to rapidly establish proof-of-concept through comparatively short duration clinical trials using validated clinical endpoints; and
◦Ability to rapidly initiate pivotal trial programs and potentially receive regulatory approval.
•Broad, portfolio-level criteria for the selection of new indications. We are including not only new indications that could enhance our speed to market such as chronic indications with high unmet need and less competition, but also indications requiring shorter-term dosing, and indications where we can take advantage of data and momentum achieved through our studies in MG, WAIHA and TED. 
•Rapidly advance development of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG and WAIHA. We are currently developing IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG and WAIHA by leveraging the strong biologic rationale of targeting FcRn to reduce IgG antibody levels and the clinical and regulatory insights gained from other FcRn-targeted therapies in MG. We also recognize the need to quickly explore subpopulations in TED to determine if the clinical performance of IMVT-1401 can be optimized in this indication.
•Identify and acquire or in-license additional innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases. Our controlling stockholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd. (“RSL”), and its subsidiaries, have a track record of acquiring or in-licensing products in a range of therapeutic areas. We will continue to partner and collaborate with RSL in identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and in-licensing opportunities in support of our goal to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet need.
IMVT-1401
Overview
IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as RVT-1401) is a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and inhibits FcRn. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, IMVT-1401 has demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in serum levels of IgG antibodies and was generally well-tolerated following subcutaneous and intravenous administration to healthy volunteers. In addition, completed clinical trials of other anti-FcRn antibodies have produced positive proof-of-concept activity in multiple IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. We believe that these data support FcRn as a viable pharmacologic target with the potential to address multiple IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. We intend to develop IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule.
IMVT-1401 has been assigned the nonproprietary name batoclimab on the World Health Organization’s Recommended International Nonproprietary Names List.
Generation of IMVT-1401 and In Vitro Properties
IMVT-1401 is the result of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by our partner, HanAll, to engineer an antibody with the potency, specificity, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties optimized for subcutaneous administration. The selection of initial candidates was the result of screening a library of nearly 10,000 antibodies generated from both transgenic animal systems as well as phage-display libraries. These initial candidates were prioritized based on:
•Potency and specificity for FcRn;
•Ability to block the IgG-FcRn interaction;
•Ability to remain bound to FcRn regardless of pH;
•High production and stability in standard antibody production cell lines;
•Ability to achieve high concentrations appropriate for subcutaneous delivery; and
•Potential lack of immunogenicity.
IMVT-1401 was generated using the OmniAb transgenic rat platform from Open Monoclonal Technology (“OMT”). OMT was later acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals in 2015.
IMVT-1401 has been engineered to express specific known mutations that eliminate effector function. Traditional antibodies contain amino acid sequences that can trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”) in which bound antibodies are recognized by effector components of the immune system which leads to inflammation. While this is an important mechanism for elimination of pathogens, triggering ADCC or CDC can lead to unintended immune activation and side effects. For this reason, IMVT-1401 was engineered with specific and validated mutations known to reduce ADCC and CDC.
Potential Benefits of IMVT-1401
As a result of the rational design of IMVT-1401, we believe that IMVT-1401, if approved for use, could provide the following benefits:
•Subcutaneous delivery. Based on PK/PD and clinical data, we believe that we will be able to obtain therapeutically relevant levels of IgG reduction using 2-mL or lesser volume subcutaneous injections. Our current formulation is concentrated at 170 mg/mL.
•Simple dosing schedule. We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneously administered regimen without the need for preceding intravenous induction doses or lengthy subcutaneous infusions. If approved, we intend to market IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, which would allow for convenient self-administration, eliminating the need for frequent and costly clinic visits, and reduce complexity and errors associated with calculating individual doses.
•Low immunogenicity risk. IMVT-1401 is a fully human monoclonal antibody, and therefore contains only amino acid sequences native to humans, hypothesizing a lower risk of immunogenicity development.
•Low effector function. IMVT-1401 has been engineered to prevent activation of other components of the immune system, and, as a result, unintended immune response to IMVT-1401 is not expected. Specifically, well-characterized and validated mutations introduced into the fragment crystallizable domain of IMVT-1401 have reduced its ability to cause ADCC and CDC.
FcRn, IgG Antibody Recycling and IMVT-1401 Mechanism of Action
The neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor is a cellular receptor that can bind IgG antibodies and guide their transport through cells. FcRn is named as such given its critical role in transferring maternal IgG antibodies contained in breast milk across the gut into the neonate’s bloodstream, providing passive immunity until such time as the child is sufficiently mature to produce its own antibodies. FcRn is also involved in the transfer of maternal IgG antibodies across the placenta in the developing fetus.
In adults, FcRn is the primary protein responsible for preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies and albumin, the most abundant protein found in the blood. IgG antibodies are constantly being removed from circulation and internalized in cellular organelles called endosomes. The role of FcRn is to bind to the IgG antibodies under the more acidic conditions of the endosome and transport them to the cell surface, where the neutral pH causes them to be released back into circulation. This FcRn mechanism of action and IgG antibody recycling is depicted in the graphic below.
FcRn and IgG Antibody Recycling
Our product candidate, IMVT-1401, is designed to block the recycling of IgG antibodies, resulting in their removal from circulation. IMVT-1401 binds to FcRn, blocking the ability of FcRn to bind to IgG antibodies under the more acidic conditions of the endosome. As a result, the bound IMVT-1401 and FcRn are transported to the cell surface, where FcRn is prevented from further recycling IgG antibodies as IMVT-1401 remains bound to FcRn even in the pH neutral environment outside the endosome. Meanwhile, the unbound IgG antibodies are degraded in the lysosome rather than being transported by FcRn for release back into circulation. This IMVT-1401 mechanism of action is depicted in the graphic below.
IMVT-1401’s Mechanism of Action
Clinical Development of IMVT-1401
We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection for a variety of IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases, and have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, WAIHA and TED . We are also pursuing a series of other indications.
Phase 1 Clinical Trials of IMVT-1401 in Healthy Volunteers
We have completed a multi-part, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial involving 99 healthy volunteers in Australia and Canada, administering IMVT-1401 both as an intravenous infusion and as a subcutaneous injection. In this trial, 77 subjects received at least one dose of IMVT-1401 and 22 subjects received placebo. The results of our Phase 1 trial are presented below:

Australian Trial data is not presented
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
The PK and PD (including serum concentrations of total IgG, albumin, and lipids) of IMVT-1401 were evaluated in healthy subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 1 Injection Site Study, and in patients with MG, TED and WAIHA in our ASCEND MG, ASCEND GO-1, ASCEND GO-2 and ASCEND WAIHA trials. To date, single doses of IMVT-1401 ranged from 100 mg to 1530 mg IV and 1.5 mg/kg to 765 mg SC and were administered to healthy subjects. Multiple doses of 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg SC QW have been studied in healthy subjects (up to 4 weeks of dosing) and patients with TED, MG or WAIHA (up to 12 weeks of dosing).
Pharmacokinetics
IMVT-1401 exhibited a non-linear PK profile which was typical of that characterized by target-mediated drug disposition ("TMDD"). The elimination of IMVT-1401 can be divided into three phases according to the concentrations. The first phase shows linear elimination; when drug concentrations are high enough to saturate targets, drug elimination is governed by linear non-target-related routes, together with a fixed rate of target-mediated elimination, which is negligible in this phase. At the second phase, the drug concentrations become lower, the targets are not all saturated and both non-target-mediated and target-mediated elimination routes are important, resulting in nonlinear PK. At the last phase, the drug concentrations are so low that targets are not saturated, the target mediated elimination becomes the main route of elimination, and the PK becomes linear again. The drug concentrations achieved after 680 mg SC QW dose were mainly in the linear elimination phase of the PK profile, may maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals for most of the subjects. However, the drug concentrations achieved after the 340 mg or 255 mg SC QW dose may not always maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals for majority of the subjects.
Pharmacodynamics
Currently, ASCEND GO-2 in TED is the largest study (total of 65 subjects, including 18 subjects on placebo) evaluated placebo and 3-dose levels of IMVT-1401 at 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg administered SC weekly for 12 weeks (“QW*12”). The preliminary PD results of total IgG by time and treatment group is presented in Figure 1. The baseline serum levels of total IgG, albumin, LDL, and HDL were comparable across all treatment groups. After active treatment, the levels of total IgG and albumin started to decrease, but the levels of LDL and HDL started to increase; both the rate and extent of reductions in total IgG and albumin or elevations of LDL and HDL were dose dependent. After 255 mg, 340 mg or 680 mg QW*12, the median Emax of total IgG reduction was 62%, 69% or 80%, respectively. For Groups 255 mg and 340 mg, total IgG levels continued to decrease as of week 12 (the last injection). For Group 680 mg, total IgG reached maximum reduction around week 7, and maintained in a plateau-like manner between weeks 7 to 12. The median Emax of albumin reduction was 16%, 26% or 40% for the 255 mg, 340 mg or 680 mg QW*12 doses, respectively. For Groups 340 mg and 680 mg, albumin levels continued to decrease as of week 12 (the last injection). For Group 255 mg, albumin reduction reached maximum around week 8, and maintained in a plateau-like manner between weeks 8 to 12. After 255 mg, 340 mg or 680 mg QW*12, the median elevation at Week 12 was 15%, 37% or 52%, respectively for LDL, and 14%, 10% or 25%, respectively for HDL. For all three active dose groups, the levels of total IgG, albumin, LDL and HDL returned to baseline within 8 weeks after the last dose of the 12-week treatment.
Figure 1  Mean (±SD) Percentage Change from Baseline of Serum Concentrations of Total IgG in Subjects in ASCEND GO-2 (Preliminary Results)
The relationships of the PD effects in total LDL vs. albumin indicate that the time course and extent of LDL elevations were highly correlated with albumin reductions. The reductions in both IgG and albumin were also highly correlated, with a coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.793. It was also noted that the lipid elevations were not correlated with changes in thyroid hormone levels (no correlations to changes in T3, T4 or TSH was observed).
Within the dose range studied, the rate and extent of total IgG reductions, albumin reductions and lipid elevations were dose dependent across different populations and the shoulder region of the dose-response curve for total IgG reductions was covered and observed. However, the shoulder region of the dose-response curve for albumin reductions or lipid elevations was not clearly observed. The extent of PD response was much larger in reductions of total IgG than reductions of albumin or elevations of lipids.
Comprehensive understanding of the PK and PD characteristics of IMVT-1401 has enabled creation of robust mathematical models to support the selection of future dosing regimens. The discordance between the PK/PD response relationship for IgG and that of albumin or LDL suggests options for dosing regimens that provide potentially effective reductions in total IgG (and pathologic autoantibodies) while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL levels. Optimized dosing regimens, if shown to be effective, could improve the risk/benefit profile of IMVT-1401 while the ease of administration of our current formulation could enhance the overall patient experience. 
Safety Data
We conducted, from February 2021 through May 2021, a program-wide data review, including safety data review, with input from external scientific and medical experts. The safety data review for each of the studies is described below.
In our multi-part, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial, IMVT-1401 was observed to be generally well-tolerated with no Grade 3 or Grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs and no discontinuations due to AEs. The most commonly reported AEs were mild erythema and swelling at the injection site, which typically resolved within hours and had a similar incidence between subjects receiving IMVT-1401 and placebo. These reactions at the injection site were not considered dose-related and did not increase with multiple administrations of IMVT-1401 in the multiple-dose cohorts. As previously disclosed, two serious AEs were reported, both of which were assessed as unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. There were no treatment-related serious AEs reported.
A summary of the most commonly reported AEs, defined as the AE reported occurred in more than one subject, is set forth in the table below:

In November 2018, one serious AE (malpighian carcinoma) occurred in a 51-year-old subject who had received a single 765 mg subcutaneous administration of IMVT-1401. Fifty-five days after study drug administration, the subject presented to his personal physician with a left-sided neck mass. Biopsy results determined the mass to be a poorly differentiated malpighian carcinoma, which was assessed as unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. In February 2019, a 25-year-old subject who received a single dose 1530 mg of IMVT-1401 by intravenous infusion presented five days later with uncomplicated acute appendicitis and the presence of an appendiceal stone. The subject underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and recovered with an uneventful post-operative course. The event was considered unrelated to study drug by the study investigator.
Dose-dependent and reversible albumin reductions were observed in the single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose cohorts. In the 680 mg multiple-ascending dose cohort, most subjects appeared to reach nadir before administration of the final dose. Mean reduction in albumin levels at day 28 were 20% in the 340 mg multiple-dose cohort, and 31% in the 680 mg multiple-dose cohort. For subjects in the 340 mg and 680 mg cohorts, the mean albumin levels at day 28 were 37.5 g/L and 32.4 g/L, respectively (normal range 36-51 g/L). These reductions were not associated with any AEs or clinical symptoms and did not lead to any study discontinuations. 
Our Phase 1 Injection Site study, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study to characterize the PK, PD, safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 was administered as single subcutaneous doses in three different injection sites in healthy participants (N = 21). In this trial, IMVT-1401 was generally well tolerated with no serious AEs reported and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. All AEs were assessed to be unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. Mild headache was reported in 33% of the overall group as compared with 25% of the placebo group. 
In our ASCEND GO-1 clinical trial, where seven participants completed the treatment period of the study and five of those participants completed the follow-up, off treatment period (the two discontinuations were not related to the study), the safety and tolerability profile observed was consistent with the Phase 1 clinical trials. In this trial, no serious AEs were observed and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. IMVT-1401 was generally well-tolerated, with the reported AEs, ranging from mild to moderate, being increase in weight, cough, fatigue, palpitations, light-headedness, and low blood pressure. One participant had a pre-existing condition of hypertension with borderline low platelets at baseline and a low platelet count after week 18.
In our ASCEND MG clinical trial, which included five participants in the 340 mg dose group, six participants in the 680 mg dose group and six participants in the placebo group, two serious AEs were reported but determined to be unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. 
In our ASCEND GO-2 clinical trial, five out of 18 participants in the 680 mg dose group reported peripheral edema with no such events noted in the other treatment groups. The events were Grade 1 or 2 (on a scale of 1 to 5), were limited in duration, and did not require permanent discontinuation of study drug. There were no reported cardiac events and injection site erythema was more common in the treated groups as compared with the placebo group. In the 255 mg dose group, one AE, optic neuropathy, was considered serious due to hospitalization, but was ultimately determined to be unrelated to the study and the participant later recovered. Triglycerides were elevated in the 340 mg and 680 mg dose groups with two participants reporting levels above 300 mg/dL and <400 mg/dL. No other serious AEs were reported.
The ASCEND WAIHA study is an ongoing, open-label trial that has been evaluated with interim results. To date, one of the five trial subjects discontinued therapy after three 680 mg SC QW doses due to a serious AE (Immune thrombocytopenia). In January 2021, a 59-year-old subject presented for the scheduled week 4 study visit and reported gingival bleeding. The week 4 dose was not administered and laboratory results revealed decreases in platelet count. Platelet count was already at a decreased level at the time of enrollment. The subject received multiple platelet transfusions over the following few weeks. In February 2021, the AE was considered as resolved and no further transfusions were needed at that time. The study investigator considered the event related to aggravation of underlying disease activity (hemolytic anemia with immune thrombocytopenia) since the subject had decreased platelet counts at initial diagnosis; however, the study investigator stated that the investigational product’s role in causing or aggravating thrombocytopenia cannot be ruled out. The adverse event was determined to be possibly related to study drug.
As previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during these Phase 1, ASCEND MG and ASCEND GO-1 clinical trials of IMVT-1401. See “Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs” for further discussion about lipid and albumin changes noted in our clinical trials.
Across all the clinical trial groups to date, we believe the safety profile of IMVT-1401 at the doses studied over a treatment interval of at least 12 weeks is acceptable and supports further development of these dosing regimens. As discussed in “Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs,” dose-dependent decreases in albumin levels have been observed with IMVT-1401; however, these decreases were generally asymptomatic except for the potentially expected AE of peripheral edema which was observed only in the 680 mg dose group and resolved without permanent discontinuation of IMVT-1401. Dose-related increases in LDL and total cholesterol have also been observed with IMVT-1401. While increases in LDL of this magnitude over a 12-week treatment duration would not be expected to pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of IMVT-1401 will need to incorporate any unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. Future study designs which include long-term treatment extensions will employ extensive PK/PD modeling to select dosing regimens that optimize reductions in total IgG while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL. These protocols will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities. The indications that we are pursuing with IMVT-1401 are associated with substantial morbidity and currently available treatments (e.g., high dose intravenous methylprednisolone) associated with significant side effects. Therefore, we believe that, if IMVT-1401 is found to be effective in these diseases, the safety profile observed to date should result in a favorable risk-benefit profile for IMVT-1401.
 No major adverse cardiovascular events have been reported to date in IMVT clinical trials.
Immunogenicity Data
The development of anti-drug antibodies (“ADA”) to IMVT-1401 was assessed across all dosed cohorts following single (IV and SC formulations) and multiple (SC formulation) administrations of IMVT-1401. Preliminary data show a similar frequency of treatment-emergent ADA development among subjects who received at least one administration of IMVT-1401 or placebo (8% and 6%, respectively). The antibody titers were low (≤ 1:16) consistent with the high sensitivity of the ADA assay. No subjects in either the 340 mg or 680 mg multiple ascending dose cohorts developed ADAs with treatment. ADAs will continue to be monitored throughout the development program.
IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis
Myasthenia Gravis Overview
MG is an autoimmune disorder associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of nerves to communicate properly with muscles. This leads to muscle weakness intensified by activity, which can be localized to exclusively to ocular muscles or which can be more generalized throughout the body including muscles of respiration. Patients with localized ocular disease suffer from more limited symptoms, including droopy eyelids and blurred or double vision due to compromise of eye movements. The vast majority of MG patients demonstrate elevated serum levels of acetylcholine receptor (“AChR”) antibodies which disrupt signal transmission between nerve fibers and muscle fibers. These antibodies ultimately lead to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue.
The prevalence of MG is estimated to be one in 5,000, with up to 66,000 cases expected in the United States. MG can occur at any age; however, the age of onset tends to follow a bimodal distribution. Early onset disease usually occurs in individuals between 10 to 30 years old and predominantly affects females. Later onset disease usually occurs in individuals over 50 years old and predominantly affects males. As with many autoimmune diseases, there are no known genetic alterations that specifically cause MG, and in most patients, it arises spontaneously. Approximately 3% of patients have a primary relative with MG, suggesting that there are genetic factors that may predispose development of the disease, but these genes have yet to be identified.
The symptoms of the disease can be transient and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months or remain chronic. After 15 to 20 years, some weakness often becomes fixed, with the most severely affected muscles frequently becoming atrophic. Many patients find it difficult to perform daily activities due to both insufficient improvement in symptoms even after treatment and in some the complicating long-term side effects of oral corticosteroids, a common treatment for MG. Approximately 15% to 20% of MG patients will experience at least one myasthenic crisis over their lifetimes. During myasthenic crisis, the impairment of muscles required to breathe can become life-threatening, leading to death in approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Up to 90% of patients in myasthenic crisis require intubation and mechanical ventilation leading to hospital stays lasting a median of 17 days. Over half of the patients who survive such a crisis remain functionally dependent upon discharge from the hospital.
These broad classes of MG severity are often referred to by a clinical classification system described by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (“MGFA”) the only national volunteer health agency in the United States dedicated solely to the fight against MG. The MGFA clinical classification divides MG patients into five classes: Class I represents patients with weakness restricted to ocular muscles, while Classes II through V represent generalized MG with severity of symptoms increasing in each Class.

 | MGFA Clinical Classification 
Class | Symptoms 
I | Weakness in ocular muscles 
II | Mild weakness in limb, head and trunk, or respiratory muscles 
III | Moderate weakness in limb, head and trunk, or respiratory muscles 
IVa | Severe weakness in non-ocular muscles, predominantly affecting muscles in limb, axial muscles, or both. May also have lesser involvement of oropharyngeal muscles 
IVb | Severe weakness in non-ocular muscles, predominantly affecting oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles, or both. May also have lesser or equal involvement of limb, axial muscles, or both.
V | Requires intubation 

Clinicians have developed a quantitative examination-based scoring system to follow a patient’s disease severity called the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (“QMG score”), which measures muscle weakness. The QMG score is divided into 13 sections, each measuring the weakness of different sets of muscles such as that of outstretched limbs, grip strength, breathing, swallowing, eye movement, speech and neck strength. Each item is assessed on a four-point scale where a score of zero represents no weakness and a score of three represents severe weakness for a maximum total score of 39. Clinicians also use the MG Activities of Daily Living (“MG-ADL”) score, a clinically validated, patient-reported measurement of the severity of MG symptoms. The MG-ADL score measures the effect of MG symptoms on eight functions as reported by the patient, including talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing and vision. Each item is assessed on a three-point scale where a score of zero represents no symptoms and a score of three represents severe symptoms for a maximum total of 24.
Previously completed clinical trials of anti-FcRn antibodies have generated promising results. In a Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by argenx SE to evaluate efgartigimod, an anti-FcRn antibody fragment for the treatment of MG, patients dosed with intravenous drug product demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant responder rate in MG-ADL score compared to those receiving placebo after four weeks of treatment. 
The most common target of autoimmune antibodies in MG are the AChR protein within the neuromuscular junction that binds to the acetylcholine neurotransmitter released by the nerve fiber terminal, and muscle-specific kinase (“MuSK”), a tyrosine kinase, which is involved in propagating neuronal signals. Anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibodies are found in approximately 85% and 8% of MG patients, respectively. The presence of these autoimmune antibodies blocks the signaling from neurons to muscles which results in an impaired ability for the muscle to contract or sustain contraction and results in outward signs of muscle weakness and fatigue.
Current Treatment Paradigm
Very early stage MG is symptomatically treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, which block the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby increasing its concentration and capacity to activate the muscle. As the disease progresses, patients are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Thymectomy may be indicated for treatment in patients with evidence of a thymoma and can be considered for treatment in some younger patients who do not have evidence of thymoma. As MG becomes more advanced, patients can be treated during exacerbations with IVIg, which provides therapeutic benefit through multiple potential mechanisms including the saturation of FcRn. However, IVIg requires recurrent, burdensome infusions to obtain significant reductions in symptoms, and the large volumes of intravenous fluid associated with the administration of IVIg can lead to significant side effects, including pulmonary edema and renal complications and treatment can be complicated by events associated with intravascular thrombosis.
Physicians direct patients with more advanced chronic disease and patients in times of crisis to therapies that reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies. One method of reducing IgG levels is to take blood from a patient and physically remove the patient’s plasma before returning the red blood cells as well as outside obtained albumin or plasma to the patient in a process called plasma exchange. This is a slow process that typically takes several hours. Furthermore, this process often requires multiple treatment sequences due to limited daily tolerance (a reported mean of six treatments in MG) over a number of days in order to achieve a significant reduction in IgG antibody levels. A variant of this procedure is immunoadsorption, in which bacterial proteins are used to selectively remove IgG antibodies from serum. The table below sets forth an overview of these treatments for MG. The most recent agent approved for MG is eculizumab, a complement C5 inhibitor, the use of which is limited to patients refractory to available therapy with anti-AChR-positive MG. Anti-MuSK antibodies have a low propensity to activate complement proteins, thus C5 inhibition may not be therapeutically relevant in anti-MuSK-positive patients. Studies indicating that patients with MuSK-positive disease are more likely to become treatment refractory thus present an additional unmet need. Approximately 10% of MG patients are refractory to current treatments, while up to 80% fail to achieve complete stable remission.

ASCEND MG Trial
In August 2019, we initiated dosing in a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG. The ASCEND MG trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in an anticipated 21 subjects with moderate-to-severe generalized MG symptoms, as defined by MGFA Class II through IVa, and QMG scores greater than or equal to 12. In the ASCEND MG trial, subjects with MG who have confirmed anti-AChR antibodies received one of two dose levels of IMVT-1401 (680 mg or 340 mg) or placebo delivered by subcutaneous injection on a weekly schedule for six weeks followed by a six-week open-label extension period, in which subjects received up to three further injections of IMVT-1401 administered every other week. There were then three follow-up visits during a six-week post-dosing period. The primary endpoints of this trial were assessment of the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 and measurement of the changes from baseline in levels of total IgG subclasses and anti-AChR IgG. Secondary endpoints included PK and changes from baseline in various clinical scores such as QMG, MG-ADL and quality of life measures. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers and receptor occupancy. 
Trial Design of ASCEND MG Trial
In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial. Results from the six-week treatment period included three arms: 340 mg IMVT-1401 weekly (N=5), 680 mg IMVT-1401 weekly (N=5), and placebo (N=5). Initially, the trial had a target enrollment of 21 subjects, however, after taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 as well as recent data from other anti-FcRn programs that have supported this mechanism in MG, we elected to unblind and report the study with 15 subjects enrolled. 
As evaluated in a pre-specified, pooled analysis of 15 subjects who completed Day 42, IMVT-1401-treated subjects (N=10) showed a mean 3.8-point improvement on the MG-ADL scale vs. a mean decline of +0.6 for placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p = 0.039)(1). IMVT-1401-treated subjects also showed a statistically significant improvement on the Myasthenia Gravis Composite ("MGC") scale, with an average improvement of 8.0 points vs. a mean decline of +1.4 for placebo (p = 0.008)(1). The MGC scale consists of test items that measure symptoms and signs of MG, with weighted response options.
MG-ADL responder rates, defined as the percentage of subjects showing a > 2-point improvement, were 60% for IMVT-1401-treated subjects vs. 20% for placebo. MG-ADL deep responder rates, defined in the study as the percentage of subjects showing a > 6-point improvement, were 40% for IMVT-1401-treated subjects vs. 0% for placebo. MGC deep responder rates, defined in the study as the percentage of subjects showing a > 10-point improvement, were 40% for IMVT-1401-treated subjects vs. 0% for placebo.
Consistent with previously reported Phase 1 results, IMVT-1401 was observed to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events (“SAEs”), no withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs), and no imbalance in headaches; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during the Phase 1 and ASCEND MG Phase 2a clinical trials of IMVT-1401. See “Safety Data” above for further discussion. Mean reductions in total serum IgG from baseline for the 340 mg and 680 mg cohorts were 59% and 76%, respectively.
After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The ASCEND MG trial is now completed. Before the voluntary pause of dosing, we had a favorable end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA on the design of our Phase 3 registrational program in MG and we are planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. Based on our integrated safety analysis, we plan to meet with the FDA to propose further development to evaluate additional dosing levels and regimens as well as to include additional safety monitoring and considerations such as lipid and albumin monitoring and incorporating an independent safety monitoring committee. Contingent upon FDA feedback, we plan to initiate a pivotal study in MG late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022. 
(1) We previously disclosed preliminary interim results for MG-ADL and MGC change from baseline analyses and their associated p-values of p=0.029 and p=0006, respectively, which were provided by the vendor contracted for the interim analysis. When conducting the final analyses for the clinical study report, the vendor noted a statistical programming error in the above analyses. QMG was also corrected by the vendor resulting in a change of the p-value from p=0.068 to p=0.075. The corrected values are shown here. 
IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Overview
WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of RBCs. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes non-specific symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. Symptoms typically develop chronically over several weeks to months, however rapid progression over a span of days has also been observed.
In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body’s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. Though the exact causes of WAIHA are unknown, roughly half of cases occur in patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.
In WAIHA, autoantibodies react with surface proteins on RBCs at temperatures at or above 37° Celsius, or normal body temperature. These antibodies are of the IgG subtype in the majority of patients. WAIHA is differentiated from cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or cold agglutinin disease, which shares a similar clinical presentation but is triggered by autoantibodies that react at temperatures below 37° Celsius. In WAIHA, antibody-coated RBCs are removed from circulation primarily in the spleen, where they are destroyed by macrophages. Studies have suggested the severity of WAIHA correlates with the amount and potency of autoantibodies present.
The laboratory evaluation of WAIHA begins with a peripheral blood analysis revealing evidence of extravascular hemolysis (spherocytes, low haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin and elevated LDH). In over 97% of cases, patients have a positive direct antiglobulin test, which detects the presence of IgG or complement proteins bound to the surface of RBCs.
The annual incidence of WAIHA in the United States and Europe is estimated at one to three in 100,000 persons. Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 42,000 patients in the United States and 67,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The disease may be more common in females, with some sources suggesting a 2:1 female predominance. Peak incidence occurs during the sixth and seventh decades of life, however, WAIHA can occur in children as well.
Current Treatment Paradigm
High doses of corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg of prednisone) are typically the first-line treatment option for WAIHA and lead to initial disease control in approximately 70-85% of cases. Once initial disease control is achieved, doses of steroids are tapered. However, only 33% of patients maintain sustained disease control once steroids are discontinued and, as a result, the majority of patients will require either long-term steroid treatment or additional therapies.
There are few studies to guide which treatment options to use in patients failing corticosteroids. Until recently, splenectomy had been a common second-line treatment option for patients not responding adequately to corticosteroids. The therapeutic benefit of splenectomy is thought to be twofold: first, it eliminates the major site of RBC destruction in WAIHA; second, removal of the spleen reduces the total lymphoid tissue capable of producing autoantibodies. However, because of the lack of reliable predictors of the outcome, morbidity and potential operative complications of splenectomy, rituximab has become the default second-line option despite not being approved for use in WAIHA. In case studies looking at patients with relapsed disease after treatment with steroids, single-agent rituximab led to responses in 65% to 90% of patients. In such a course of treatment, maximal therapeutic effect is not immediate.
Patients with persistent disease despite use of corticosteroids and rituximab may be offered a course of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine sirolimus.
IVIg is not routinely used alone for the treatment of WAIHA, however, small case series have suggested some evidence for a therapeutic effect in patients suffering from life-threatening complications of the disease. In these reports, IVIg has been given at high doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/kg per day), and the results have been inconsistent, requiring repeated courses of treatment in at least one case.
RBC transfusions are indicated in patients who require immediate stabilization. Such patients are monitored closely for evidence of a transfusion reaction. In contrast to other treatment modalities that lead to nonspecific suppression of the immune system, IMVT-1401 may offer a more targeted approach for reducing levels of the causative IgG species responsible for most cases of WAIHA. We believe this could provide a favorable therapeutic window and avoid the significant side effects associated with less targeted immunosuppression.
ASCEND WAIHA Trial
In November 2019, we submitted our IND to the FDA for WAIHA and, in December 2019, our IND was cleared for Phase 2 trial initiation. The ASCEND WAIHA trial will explore the potential of IMVT-1401 to increase hemoglobin levels and assess the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 in this population. Subjects in this trial will be treated with one of two doses of IMVT-1401 (680 mg or 340 mg) administered weekly by subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects achieving a hemoglobin level of at least 10 g/dL and at least a 2 g/dL increase from baseline. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in other hematologic and chemistry parameters, time to response, patient reported outcome measures, total IgG antibodies and IgG antibodies by subclasses. 
The ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label design, so the program-wide pause in dosing resulted in this trial being suspended. During the fall of 2021, we plan to commence discussions with the FDA on re-initiating this study, incorporating safety considerations and risk management as well as additional dosing regimens. We anticipate re-initiating this study based on a favorable outcome from these meetings late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.

IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease
Thyroid Eye Disease Overview
TED, also referred to as GO, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. By the time that TED is clinically diagnosed, many patients have retraction of their upper eyelids, swelling and redness surrounding the eyes and protrusion of the eyes. In some cases, swelling and stiffness of the muscles that move the eyes cause the eyes to no longer line up with each other or for the eyelids to no longer be able to close. Approximately 3% to 5% of TED patients have a severe manifestation of the disease, with intense pain, inflammation and sight-threatening corneal ulcers or optic neuropathy that requires surgical intervention. Decompression surgery to improve ocular function or rehabilitative surgery to improve quality of life is required in up to 20% of TED patients.
TED is most commonly caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (“TSHR”). These antibodies activate certain cell types, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes, present in the extraocular space, which are known to highly express TSHR. The activation of these fibroblasts causes them to proliferate and to produce hyaluronan, a substance that contributes directly to the swelling associated with TED. Hyaluronan also serves as an inflammatory signal leading to the synthesis of cytokines that cause recruitment of lymphocytes and extensive tissue inflammation and remodeling. Exposure to other inflammatory agents, such as cigarette smoke, lead to exacerbation of the disease resulting in more severe symptoms. Anti-TSHR antibodies also increase the proliferation of adipose or fat cells as well as myofibroblasts, smooth muscle-like cells. Levels of anti-TSHR autoantibodies correlate positively with clinical features of TED and influence its prognosis.
In addition to anti-TSHR autoantibodies, antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (“IGF1R”) have been described in the literature. TSHR and IGF1R have functional overlaps and stimulation of either receptor may lead to activation of similar biochemical pathways in certain cell types, including the ones implicated in TED. Published studies investing this pathway have led to the discovery that the IGF1R and TSHR form a receptor complex where IGF1R can augment the signaling of TSHR. The exact nature of the interaction between IGF1R and TSHR continues to be investigated; however, experimental evidence suggests that the effects of TSHR stimulating antibodies are only partially blocked by an IGF1R antagonist while they may be completely blocked with a TSHR antagonist.
TED has an estimated annual incidence of 16 in 100,000 women and 2.9 in 100,000 men in North America and Europe. The natural history of TED begins with an inflammatory phase lasting between six and 24 months that is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation and increases in adipose tissue. The first line of treatment for TED patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Treatment of patients with immunosuppressive therapies during this active inflammatory phase can lead to reduction in symptoms and can alter the course of the disease. However, once the initial inflammatory phase is over, immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective and levels of fibrosis that have developed as the result of acute inflammation are only reversible by surgery. We estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States have active inflammatory TED and are eligible for treatment.
Clinicians use the CAS to measure disease activity in TED patients. CAS is based on seven parameters, including spontaneous pain behind the eye, pain with eye movement, redness of the eyelids, redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, swelling of the caruncle and swelling of the conjunctiva. A score is calculated based on the number of parameters that are positive with scores of four or above considered to be cases of active disease. Changes in disease severity over time are determined by changes in proptosis, or protrusion of the eyeball, eye movements and visual acuity.
Relationship between TED and Graves’ Disease
TED often develops in parallel with Graves’ disease, a related but clinically distinct autoimmune disease. In Graves’ disease, anti-TSHR autoantibodies cause the thyroid to become overactive, resulting in a condition called hyperthyroidism, in which the thyroid overproduces thyroid hormone. If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle and fertility.
A close temporal relationship exists between the onset of Graves’ disease and the onset of TED. Regardless of which condition occurs first, in 80% of patients, the other condition develops within 18 months. Approximately one in 20 patients with Graves’ disease present with moderate-to-severe TED, which is characterized by swelling and redness of eyelids, proptosis, double vision and, in severe cases, corneal ulceration and decreased visual acuity. Graves’ disease can be treated with antithyroid drugs or removal of the thyroid through a procedure called a thyroidectomy. While some studies of these treatments have shown autoimmune antibodies decreasing or disappearing with treatment, others have shown no change in antibody levels after treatment.
Current Treatment Paradigm
As a first option, patients with active TED are treated with immunosuppressive therapy such as high-doses of corticosteroids, typically administered intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids are not effective in all patients, and approximately one-third of patients will relapse. This therapy is associated with an increased risk of acute and severe organ damage, bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and depression. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics’ Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED.
Orbital radiation therapy is used as a means of reducing the infiltration of lymphocytes and can be used in conjunction with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. Similar to these anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy is most effective in the active stage of TED.
Patients with moderate-to-severe active TED which is still in the active stage and who do not respond adequately to corticosteroids can be treated with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil, two broad immunosuppressive drugs. These powerful drugs are associated with numerous side effects related both to their general immunosuppressive effects as well as to inherent toxicities, such as hypertension, kidney disease and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Small case studies have identified rituximab as an alternate way of inducing immunosuppression in patients with TED. Rituximab (Roche) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to B cells, leading to their destruction. However, rituximab is associated with the potential for serious side effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Rare cases of progressive multifocal encephalopathy and other viral infections have also been reported.
Surgery is considered to be a treatment option in patients with a high CAS who have been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy but continue to have progressive disease. The goal of surgery is to reduce the pressure causing proptosis, reduced eye movement and loss of visual acuity. Because of its invasive nature, surgery is typically reserved for inactive disease.
We believe that a therapy for TED focused on addressing the cause of the disease, namely the presence of autoimmune antibodies, represents an attractive approach that has the potential to avoid many of the serious side effects of current therapies. In previously conducted third-party studies, levels of autoimmune antibodies were reduced through plasmapheresis and IVIg and resulted in therapeutic benefit. We expect that IMVT-1401 has the potential to deliver similar benefits. Because the mode of action of IMVT-1401 is independent of the antigen recognized by the autoimmune antibodies, we believe that IMVT-1401 can address TED that arises through any IgG autoantibody mechanism whether it be anti-TSHR, anti-IGF1R, or any other IgG autoantibodies.
ASCEND GO-1 Trial
In May 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-1 trial, an open label single-arm Phase 2a clinical trial of IMVT-1401 in Canada in patients with TED. We announced initial results from this trial in March 2020. The trial is now completed. Subjects recruited for this trial have moderate-to-severe active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to TSHR. A total of seven subjects were dosed weekly with subcutaneous injections for six weeks. The trial utilized an induction and maintenance strategy, using only subcutaneous injections. Subjects received a 680 mg dose for the first two weekly administrations of the study drug followed by a 340 mg dose weekly for the final four administrations. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 over the six-week treatment period, as well as the change from baseline in levels of anti-TSHR antibodies, total IgG antibodies and IgG antibodies by subclasses. Secondary clinical endpoints included mean changes in proptosis, or protrusion of the eyeball, the proptosis responder rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with a greater than or equal to 2 mm reduction in proptosis in the study eye without deterioration in the fellow eye, PK and anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of change from baseline in the CAS, change from baseline in the Gorman diplopia score, multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers, receptor occupancy and changes as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scans.
Trial Design of ASCEND GO-1 Trial
All seven subjects completed the six-week treatment phase of the trial and entered the 12-week follow-up phase. Mean reduction in total IgG levels from baseline to end of treatment was 65%. As evaluated at the end of treatment, four of seven subjects (57%) improved by ≥ 2 points on the CAS. Of six subjects with baseline diplopia, four subjects (67%) demonstrated improvement in diplopia. Three of seven subjects (43%) were proptosis responders. The safety and tolerability profile observed was consistent with the prior Phase 1 trial of IMVT-1401 in 99 healthy volunteers; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during the Phase 1 and ASCEND GO-1 Phase 2a clinical trials of IMVT-1401. Mean albumin reduction from baseline to end of treatment was 24%. All AEs were mild or moderate. See “Safety Data” above for further discussion. 
ASCEND GO-2 Trial
In October 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in 77 subjects with moderate-to-severe active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to TSHR. The ASCEND GO-2 trial explored the potential of IMVT-1401 to improve proptosis and assesses the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 in this population. Subjects in this trial were treated with one of three doses of IMVT-1401 (680 mg, 340 mg or 255 mg) or placebo administered weekly by subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks. The primary endpoints of this trial were the proptosis responder rate measured at week 13, defined as the percentage of subjects with a greater than or equal to 2 mm reduction in proptosis in the study eye without deterioration in the fellow eye, and safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included the proptosis responder rate measured at weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 20, the proportion of subjects with a CAS of 0 or 1, the mean change from baseline in proptosis, CAS, diplopia, ophthalmic improvement and GO-QOL and PK, PD, defined as anti-TSHR antibodies and total IgG and IgG antibodies by subclasses, and anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of CT-measured muscle volume, fat volume, total orbital volume and proptosis, as well as multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers and receptor occupancy. 
Trial Design of ASCEND GO-2 Trial
Our voluntary pause in dosing resulted in unblinding the ASCEND GO-2 trial. As a result, following the last patient last visit of the post-treatment follow-up period, the ASCEND GO-2 trial was terminated. Treatment with IMVT-1401 reduced both IgG and disease specific pathogenic IgG over the 12-week treatment period. However, the efficacy results, based on approximately half the anticipated number of subjects who had reached the week 13 primary efficacy analysis at the time of the termination of the trial, were inconclusive. The primary endpoint of the proportion of proptosis responders was not met, and although not tested statistically, post hoc evaluation of other endpoints measured (CAS and diplopia scores) indicated the desired magnitude of treatment effect likely would not have been achieved. However, levels of IgG were reduced across IMVT-1401 dosing groups, and analysis of the receptor occupancy data suggest binding of IMVT-1401 to the Fc receptor. Additional exploratory work on other disease biomarkers is under evaluation. Further discussions with external experts are ongoing to determine whether a specific population can be identified to optimize the clinical performance of IMVT-1401. Based on these analyses, we are likely to design another Phase 2 trial in TED or another thyroid-related disease as our next study in this therapeutic area and initiate discussions with regulatory authorities before the end of the calendar year 2021.

Services Agreements with RSI and RSG
In August 2018, we entered into services agreements with Roivant Sciences Inc. (“RSI”) and RSG, collectively the Services Agreements, under which RSI and RSG agreed to provide services related to development, administrative and financial activities to us during our formative period. Under each Services Agreement, we will pay or reimburse RSI or RSG, as applicable, for any expenses they, or third parties acting on our behalf, incur. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI or RSG employees, RSI or RSG, as applicable, will charge back the employee compensation expense plus a pre-determined markup. RSI and RSG also provided such services prior to the formalization of the Services Agreements, and such costs have been recognized by us in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters. All other costs will be billed back at cost. The term of the Services Agreements will continue until terminated by us, RSI or RSG, as applicable, upon 90 days’ written notice.
RSL Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
In December 2018, we entered into an amended and restated information sharing and cooperation agreement, or the Cooperation Agreement with RSL, which, among other things: (1) obligates us to deliver to RSL periodic financial statements and other information upon reasonable request and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; (2) requires us to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings; and (3) requires us to implement and observe certain policies and procedures related to applicable laws and regulations. We have agreed to indemnify RSL and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees and directors against all losses arising out of, due to or in connection with RSL’s status as a stockholder under the Cooperation Agreement and the operations of or services provided by RSL or its affiliates or their respective officers, employees or directors to us or any of our subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Cooperation Agreement. No amounts have been paid or received under this agreement; however, we believe this agreement is material to our business and operations.
Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the mutual written consent of the parties or (2) the later of when RSL no longer (a) is required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in us under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC and (b) has the right to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors.
We are a Member of the Roivant Family of Companies
We are a majority-owned subsidiary of RSL and have benefited from our ability to leverage the Roivant model and the greater Roivant platform. The period of time between our formation and operational maturation was shortened based on the support from centralized Roivant functions available since creation. This includes operational functions as well as access to Roivant’s proprietary technology and digital innovation platforms. Consistent with its model, Roivant has also provided us with access to an embedded team of scientific experts, physicians and technologists to help optimize clinical development and commercial strategies. In the future, we may have the ability to benefit from Roivant’s economies of scale and scope, including but not limited to the opportunity to:
•leverage Roivant’s business development engine and vast network of industry relationships for the identification of, and access to, new assets and synergistic partnerships;
•enter channel partnerships with other members of the Roivant family of companies (including but not limited to technology-focused companies built by Roivant), with the goal of delivering efficiencies in the development and commercialization process;
•access Roivant’s human capital engine to recruit new employees from within and beyond the biopharmaceutical industry;
•enable its employees to participate in Roivant’s career development program which facilitates employee mobility across members of the Roivant family of companies;
•benefit from shared learnings, best practices, and external industry relationships across the Roivant family of companies; and
•derive certain benefits of scale upon becoming a commercial-stage company.
For a discussion on RSL’s significant ownership of our shares of common stock and related possible risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, “RSL owns a significant percentage of shares of our common stock and may exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.”
Sales and Marketing
We do not currently have our own marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, we would have to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure. We intend to build a small, targeted sales organization in the United States, targeting specialist physicians that treat high numbers of patients with autoimmune conditions. We believe these physicians treat a majority of patients with the autoimmune indications that we intend to target and most often serve as the diagnosing and treating physicians for such indications. We may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates inside and outside the United States.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of IMVT-1401, and there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements (particularly for the development of antibodies) that might be capable of manufacturing for us. We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), for both drug substance and drug product. Currently, we contract with well-established third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our drug substance and our drug product. We expect to engage additional third-party manufacturers to support any pivotal clinical trials for IMVT-1401 as well as commercialization of IMVT-1401, if approved, in the United States or other jurisdictions. In addition, we continue to augment the organization by recruiting personnel with experience to manage the CMOs producing our product candidate and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future.
Our outsourced approach to manufacturing relies on CMOs to first develop cell lines and manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP then produce material for nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Our agreements with CMOs may obligate them to develop a production cell line, establish master and working cell banks, develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product process, validate (and in some cases develop) suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing, produce drug substance for nonclinical testing, produce cGMP-compliant drug substance, or produce cGMP-compliant drug product. We conduct audits of CMOs prior to initiation of activities under these agreements and monitor operations to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations.
Competition
We expect to face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple agents which are in the same class as IMVT-1401. We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These include efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab (Johnson & Johnson), rozanolixizumab (UCB) and ALXN1830 (Alexion Pharmaceuticals). Each of efgartigimod, nipocalimab, and rozanolixizumab is currently under development for the treatment of MG. Alexion has announced plans to begin Phase 2 trials for ALXN1830 in MG and WAIHA in the second half of 2021. Johnson & Johnson is currently running a Phase 2/3 clinical study for nipocalimab in WAIHA. Johnson & Johnson also announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for nipocalimab in WAIHA.
In a Phase 1 trial conducted by argenx SE, efgartigimod was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 50% after two 20 mg/kg intravenous induction doses followed by eight weekly 300 mg subcutaneous doses. In a Phase 2 trial conducted in MG, UCB’s rozanolixizumab was infused subcutaneously, over 30 minutes, and was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 56% and approximately 68% after three and six weekly 7 mg/kg infusions, respectively. Johnson & Johnson’s nipocalimab is in clinical development with a subcutaneous formulation. Clinical results for Alexion’s subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1830 are not available.
IMVT-1401, if approved, may also face competition from agents with different mechanisms of action. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics’ Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by Alexion), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. The first line of treatment for TED and WAIHA patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED, WAIHA and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Johnson & Johnson is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include: zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, inebilizumab (Horizon Therapeutics), a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, and Ravulizumab-cwvz (Alexion), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, all of which are currently in Phase 3 trials. 
Numerous product candidates are currently in development for the treatment of WAIHA. Fostamatinib (Rigel Pharmaceuticals), a syk inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of WAIHA. A Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of ibrutinib (AbbVie), a BTK inhibitor, in steroid-refractory WAIHA is ongoing. Annexon Biosciences plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for WAIHA in 2021 for ANX005, an antibody inhibitor of the C1q protein.
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon its ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that it may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage, reimbursement and public opinion. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
Accordingly, competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for any of our targeted indications by a competitor could render our product candidate non-competitive or obsolete, or reduce the demand for its product candidate before it can recover its development and commercialization expenses.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for IMVT-1401 and any of its future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to any products we develop or processes we use may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.
Following our assumption of all rights, title, interest and obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG in December 2018, by virtue of the license of patent rights under the HanAll Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of a patent family directed to IMVT-1401, and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, in the Licensed Territory. As of May 28, 2021, this licensed patent family includes pending patent applications and/or issued patent(s) in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, European Patent Office, Egypt, Israel, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. This in-licensed patent family discloses anti-FcRn antibodies, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of treating autoimmune disease using the same, polynucleotides encoding such antibodies, expression vectors including such polynucleotides, host cells transfected with such recombinant expression vectors, methods of manufacturing such antibodies and methods of detecting FcRn in vivo or in vitro using such antibodies. Notably, in the in-licensed patent family, a U.S. patent was issued on July 2, 2019, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen–binding fragment thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Furthermore, another U.S. patent was issued in this in-licensed patent family on January 28, 2020, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof as well as methods of treating various autoimmune diseases using the antibody, polynucleotides and expression vectors encoding the antibody, host cells capable of expressing the antibody and methods of producing the antibody. Additionally, as of May 28, 2021, independent of the licensed patent family, ISG has a patent family directed to methods of treating thyroid eye disease using anti-FcRn antibodies that includes patent applications in the United States as well as foreign counterparts in certain jurisdictions within its Licensed Territory and another patent family that includes an internationally filed patent application directed to methods of treating warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia using anti-FcRn antibodies. Generally, the term of any patent granted from a patent application in the in-licensed HanAll patent family directed to the IMVT-1401 composition of matter and methods of use has a projected natural expiration and will expire on April 30, 2035 in the United States, subject to such terms as may be modified by, for example, terminal disclaimer or any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular jurisdiction. 
In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date, as the term of a patent granted on a utility patent application filed after June 8, 1995 expires 20 years after the non-provisional U.S. filing date (or any earlier filing date relied upon under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c)), with the timely payment of maintenance fees. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for certain delays incurred by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in the examination process, issuing the patent and/or the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the patent extension granted for FDA regulatory review is only applied to a single patent that covers either the product candidate or a method of using or manufacturing the same which has not expired at the time of FDA approval. Additionally, the period of time the patent is extended may not exceed five years, and the total patent term, including the period of time the patent is extended, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The protection afforded by a patent with respect to a particular product varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in the particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent under the local laws. ISG owns a trademark for IMMUNOVANT, the corporate logo, and a composite trademark for its corporate logo with the IMMUNOVANT mark. As of May 28, 2021, this trademark portfolio includes pending trademark applications and/or registered trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Under the HanAll Agreement, we have the right to market IMVT-1401 in the Licensed Territory under the trademark(s) of our choice, subject to regulatory approval. However, upon termination of the HanAll Agreement, we must assign to HanAll all right, title and interest in and to any and all trademarks we use in the development, manufacture or commercialization of the licensed products.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant it ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter its development or commercial strategies for our product candidates or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that it may require to develop or commercialize its future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory health authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies and health authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate.
FDA Drug Approval Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under both the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) regulations, International Council for Harmonisation (“ICH”) guidance, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated at least annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee for each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•conduct of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), and other clinical-trial related regulations and guidance to evaluate the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for each proposed indication;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials that includes manufacturing information and substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency;
•potential FDA audit of selected clinical investigation sites, preclinical studies, and/or Immunovant as clinical trial sponsor to assess compliance with FDA’s GCP standards;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);
•agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”); and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable, to permit commercial marketing or sale of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Our product candidates are being developed to be registered as pre-filled syringes and autoinjectors, which means that they are subject to regulation as combination products because they are composed of both a biologic product and device product. If approved and marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. Accordingly, our product candidates are subject to the IND framework for premarket development and approval through the BLA pathway. Based on our understanding of FDA’s combination device expectations, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the syringe, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit.
European Union Drug Approval Process
In the European Union (the “E.U.”), there are three existing regulatory procedures for a medicinal product to be authorized for use in the Member States of the E.U. and the European Economic Area under the E.U. pharmaceutical legislation that harmonizes the regulatory standards and requirements for assessing safety, quality and efficacy.
A medicinal product for human use may be authorized either by the European Commission through the centralized procedure or by national competent authorities through a mutual recognition, decentralized or national procedure. We have focused on the centralized procedure as we expect it to be the relevant procedure for our product candidates.
The centralized procedure applies to a medicinal product for human use containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the E.U. for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of any of the following diseases: acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. In addition, the following product categories must also be centrally authorized: a medicinal product developed by means of recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods. A medicinal product that has been designated as an orphan medicinal product must also be evaluated through the centralized procedure. A medicinal product that is considered as constituting a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or its approval is in the interests of E.U. patients is also eligible for the optional centralized assessment. The centralized procedure requires applicants to submit an application for marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) which is responsible for the coordinating the scientific assessment to be performed by its relevant advisory committees, including the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Once a positive opinion is adopted by the CHMP, the European Commission will issue a binding decision on granting the centralized marketing authorization which is valid throughout the Member States of the E.U. and the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).
A reference medicinal product approved via the centralized procedure receives a period of 10 years data and market protection or exclusivity upon grant of a marketing authorization. This period is divided into eight years of data protection within which no generic applicant including a biosimilar applicant can cross-reference the non-clinical and clinical data contained in the file of the reference medicinal product. Even if an authorization is granted based on data cross-referencing, the follow-on manufacturer cannot market the product for two further years (the period of market protection). This period can be extended to a total period of 11 years if during the first eight years of the protection period one or more new therapeutic indications are determined, during the regulatory review, to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies and the indication application is approved.
On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) left the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and accordingly is no longer a Member State. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which E.U. pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the U.K., which ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the U.K. covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from E.U. regulations, Brexit has materially impacted, and could further materially impact, the regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K., as U.K. legislation now has the potential to diverge from E.U. legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K. in the long-term. As the U.K. is no longer an E.U. Member State, the U.K.’s participation in the European Medicines Regulatory Network has ceased and the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has assumed the functions that were previously undertaken by the E.U. for human medicines on the U.K. market (with the exception of Northern Ireland, which, pursuant to the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland has remained aligned with E.U. regulations). The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the U.K.’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time. 
The MHRA offers new assessment procedures for applications for products containing new active substances and biosimilars. The procedures can lead to a marketing authorization in Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales), the United Kingdom, or Northern Ireland, depending on the procedure and pre-existing authorizations, as further explained below. The new assessments include:
•     The European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure will be in place until January 1, 2023 and is a targeted assessment of new applications for products containing new active substances or biosimilars under review via the centralized procedure with EMA. MHRA will review the application, CHMP assessment report, and applicant responses to CHMP within 67 days. Should that review be successful, it will lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the centralized marketing authorization in the E.U. will already permit the marketing of the relevant product in Northern Ireland;
•    A full assessment as a national authorization can be chosen for new active substances, with a timeline of no more than 150 days (excluding clock-off periods where further information is requested) which can lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the U.K., or Northern Ireland. If the application includes Northern Ireland then it must comply with the relevant E.U. requirements; 
•    The Unfettered Access Procedure for medicines already approved in Northern Ireland via the E.U. procedures or via the Northern Ireland national route which if successful will lead to a Great Britain marketing authorization; and
•    A ‘rolling review’, for new active substances and biosimilars, which allows companies to make an application in stages, throughout the product’s development, to better manage development risk which can lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the U.K., or Northern Ireland. If the application includes Northern Ireland then it must comply with the relevant E.U. requirements.
Nonclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes the clinical protocols and general development plan, as well as results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until the IND sponsor and the FDA resolve the outstanding concerns or questions. The FDA also may impose clinical holds at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Submission of an IND therefore does not guarantee that FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial will be granted or that, once begun, issues will not arise that adversely impact, suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments and additional information such as toxicology or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) data in support of the investigational product(s). For new indications, a separate new IND is usually required. Outside of the U.S., clinical trial applications are generally required to conduct clinical studies in each country. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or independent data monitoring committee, which provides direction for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. For purposes of BLA/MAA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. 
•Phase 1 — The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, tolerability, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on pharmacodynamics and effectiveness.
•Phase 2 — The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 — The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple global clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to support chronic use of a product during marketing.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or, in certain circumstances, mandated after approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting or in some cases to support full approval for products that are approved via an accelerated pathway as described below. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA, and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA, other regulators, and investigators within a regulated timeframe for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. The FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission, Review and Approval
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA reviews the BLA within 60 days to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet PDUFA goal dates, and the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification or Company submissions of substantial data during the review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites, preclinical studies, and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, and where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter prior to inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, completion of other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, and/or conduct of additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may determine that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may require additional testing or information.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed, which could limit the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product, and could include medication guides, healthcare professional and/or patient communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre-and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may impose post-marketing requirements and commitments such as additional manufacturing data or testing; additional preclinical data or evaluation; additional clinical data from Phase 3 studies (e.g. long-term extension data); and may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval.
A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation means the FDA’s goal under PDUFA is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of a product, and also provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team. The FDA may also review complete sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the entire application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. The review clock generally does not begin until the final section of the BLA is submitted.
In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA will take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a validated surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on survival, irreversible morbidity or another clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Approval may be withdrawn if the confirmatory study does not verify the anticipated clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Similarly, in the E.U., the European Commission grants binding decision on orphan designations after a satisfactory scientific assessment provided by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. To qualify for orphan designation, a medicinal product must meet the following criteria set out in E.U. Orphan Medicinal Products Regulation:
•it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;
•the prevalence of the condition in the E.U. must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and
•no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
The orphan designation granted is re-assessed at the time when the marketing authorization is granted in order to confirm whether the statutory criteria continue to be met. If the criteria are no longer met, then the orphan designation is removed.
If the orphan designation is maintained when the marketing authorization is granted, then the orphan medicinal product will receive 10-year orphan market exclusivity in respect of the approved indication. This exclusivity period prevents a similar medicinal product being accepted by the E.U. regulatory authorities for approval. This exclusivity period can be extended to a total period of 12 years under the E.U. Pediatric Regulation in lieu of six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate, if certain requirements are met. The orphan exclusivity is run in parallel with the basic regulatory data/market protection or exclusivity period of 10 years in the E.U. However, this period can be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met where it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Following the U.K.’ s departure from the E.U. there is no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation in Great Britain. Instead, orphan designation is applied for at the same time as applying for a marketing authorization. While the criteria for gaining orphan designation remain effectively the same in Great Britain as in the European Union, the designation will be based on the prevalence of the relevant condition in Great Britain.
The 10 years market exclusivity from competition from similar products in the approved orphan indication would be retained. If criteria for orphan status are met, this incentive would be awarded following grant of a U.K. marketing authorization. Similarly, in the E.U., orphan medicines which are authorized in Great Britain with the results of studies from a pediatric investigation plan included in the product information are eligible for an additional 2 years of market exclusivity.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), a drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study or studies within a defined timeframe.
In the E.U., a sponsor is required to obtain an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) which describes a program of pediatric studies to generate meaningful data to inform the use of the product in the pediatric population. The data derived from the PIP must be submitted with the marketing authorization application unless a waiver or a deferral is granted. Otherwise, the application will not be accepted by the EMA for review. If the pediatric data required by the PIP are submitted, irrespective of whether the data have led to approval of a pediatric indication, the orphan exclusivity period is extended to a total period of 12 years. For a product which is not an orphan medicinal product, the supplementary protection certificate can be extended to a further six months under the E.U. pediatric rules. For a medicinal product which is no longer protected by a subsisting patent, a pediatric use marketing authorization can be sought and upon approval, a period of 10 years regulatory data exclusivity or protection is granted.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, issuance by FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warnings or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions, consent decrees or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and misbranding. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including monetary penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication (or thirty days in advance of their first use if approved via the accelerated approval pathway). Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA") signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe, but no interchangeable biologic has been approved in the United States. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
In the E.U., a biosimilar product is approved under a different regulatory pathway, recognizing that a biosimilar product does not meet the conditions set out in the definition of a generic medicinal product owing to in particular differences relating to raw materials or differences in manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the reference biological medicinal. In view of these differences, a biosimilar is required to provide the results of appropriate comparative clinical and non-clinical studies with the reference biological medicinal product to demonstrate that the biosimilar is both highly similar to the reference product (notwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines) and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference medicine in terms of safety, quality, and efficacy. However, the biosimilar manufacturer is not required to replicate the testing results or trial data contained in the dossier of the reference biological medicinal product. 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) or other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments and regulatory authorities. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and transparency, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to certain of these laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and, for example, prescribers, purchasers, third party payors, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from the reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The exceptions and safe harbors are interpreted narrowly by enforcement authorities, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending any product payable by the federal health care programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, where an arrangement does not clearly meet the terms of an applicable exception or safe harbor, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on prudential factors that authorities, including the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, utilize to determine whether a particular arrangement poses a risk of fraud and abuse to the federal health care programs (e.g., increasing costs to government payors). Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, and we cannot rule out the possibility that enforcement authorities, including the Office of Inspector General, could scrutinize our practices in the future.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) (discussed below).
The federal false claims laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or “qui tam” actions, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been, and continue to be, prosecuted under these laws, among other things, for various conduct. For example, enforcement has pursued manufacturers allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, and also for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes that were added by HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We may be subject to data privacy, security, and breach notification regulations administered by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. If we were to enter into a “business associate” relationship with a “covered entity” (“covered entities” being group health plans, certain healthcare providers, and “healthcare clearinghouses”), we would be subject to the HHS regulations related to data privacy, security and security breach notification under the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA (Title II, Subtitle F of HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). Those regulations authorize the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, attorneys’ fees and costs. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”) within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties.
Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor (i.e., are not exclusive to government payors). We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, drug pricing or marketing expenditures. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts.
We are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) enacted by the U.S. government, which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription biologic at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period from its enactment on November 27, 2013. In addition, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution. Compliance with DSCSA and current and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements could require significant capital expenditures, increase our operating costs and impose significant administrative burdens. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign countries or sell any of our products in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada or the E.U., we may be subject to additional regulation.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and results of operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which Immunovant may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which Immunovant receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.
Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, which decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician, and these products also may have difficulty obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement levels based on payor cost sensitivities and the potential application of formulary management controls (e.g., step edits through alternative therapies). Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to closely evaluating their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult given the potential cost sensitivities often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. It is not clear that third party payors will accept the pharmacoeconomic benefits of products that we commercialize, and we also may need to undertake detailed studies of any therapies that we commercialize in order to demonstrate their pharmacoeconomic benefits, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective for certain patients, including depending on the nature of the FDA approvals that we may receive. There is no assurance of coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products under either government programs or from commercial payors. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the E.U., governments influence the price of biopharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to establish their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become a close focus of government and state regulators. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement rates are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future, which could have a downward pressure on our commercialization efforts.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the ACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23% and 13% of the Average Manufacturer Price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
•requirements to report certain financial arrangements with certain healthcare providers and teaching hospitals;
•a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and
•a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
Since its enactment, there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and will remain open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. On February 10, 2021, the Biden administration withdrew the federal government’s support for overturning the ACA. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. It is unclear how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is also unclear.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the former Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. Further, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump's Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. The Most Favored Nation regulations mandate participation by identified Medicare Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. 
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to COVID-19.
We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding safe working conditions, environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Human Capital Management
Employees
As of May 31, 2021, we had 68 full-time permanent employees, primarily in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 72% have advanced degrees including but not limited to Ph.D., M.D., M.B.A., and approximately 66% were engaged in research and development activities. More than half of our workforce, as well as our executive leadership, is comprised of women. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not had any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
As the clinical development of our product candidates progresses, we also expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of clinical development, quality, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we also expect to hire additional personnel in order to sustain operations as a public company.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants through the granting of stock-based compensation and performance cash awards. Our cash bonus awards are based on Company and departmental progress toward key annual goals and employee performance.
Response to COVID-19
We are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees.  With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the best interest of the safety of our employees, we transitioned to a remote work model in March 2020 and our workforce continues to work remotely. We are supporting our employees through this transition by providing the necessary information technology and collaboration tools to ensure business continuity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we hired a considerable number of employees and effectively onboarded talent through the remote work environment. We gained significant experience in hiring, onboarding and operating under a remote work environment. This valuable experience has enabled us to enhance our recruitment strategies by targeting high-potential talent based primarily on technical capabilities, skills, experience level and cultural alignment, regardless of geographic location. We believe our access to a broader talent pool will continue to contribute to our effectiveness in working in a remote environment.
Corporate Information
Prior to December 18, 2019, we were known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation (“HSAC”). HSAC was incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2018 and formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 18, 2019, HSAC completed the Business Combination, pursuant to which HSAC acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ISL, a Bermuda exempted limited company. Subsequent to the acquisition, ISL became a wholly owned subsidiary of HSAC and we were renamed “Immunovant, Inc.”
