Item 1. Business. GTY Business Overview
 GTY Technology Holdings Inc. (GTY)  is software as a service (“SaaS”) company that offers a cloud-based suite of solutions for the public sector, in North America. GTY brings leading government technology companies together to achieve a new standard in citizen engagement and resource management.  GTY solutions provide public sector organizations with the ability to communicate, engage, interact, conduct business and transact with their constituents in a simple and easy manner spanning functions in procurement, payments, grants management, budgeting, and permitting. 
 GTY operates  through  six operating subsidiaries: Bonfire provides strategic sourcing and procurement software to enable confident and compliant spending decisions; CityBase provides government payment solutions to connect constituents with utilities and government agencies; eCivis offers a grants management system to maximize grant revenues and track performance; Open Counter provides government permitting software to guide applicants through complex permitting and licensing procedures; Questica offers budget preparation and management software to deliver on financial and non-financial strategic objectives; Sherpa provides public sector budgeting software and consulting services.
 We were initially formed as a blank check company incorporated on August 11, 2016 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Until the consummation of the business combination, we did not engage in any operations nor generated any revenue.
 On November 1, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering of 55,200,000 units, including the issuance of 7,200,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $552 million. Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, in August, 2016, GTY Investors, LLC (the “Sponsor”) purchased 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares (“founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. On each of October 14 and October 26, 2016, we effected a share capitalization resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 and 13,800,000 founder shares outstanding, respectively. In October 2016, the Sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at the same per-share purchase price paid by the Sponsor.
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 8,693,334 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $13.04 million.
 Upon the closing of the initial public offering and private placement on November 1, 2016, $552 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 Initially, we were required to complete our initial business combination by November 1, 2018, which was 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. On October 30, 2018, our shareholders approved a proposal to amend our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we had to consummate an initial business combination from November 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019. In connection with such proposal, our public shareholders had the right to elect to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for a per share price, payable in cash, based upon the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. Our public shareholders holding 34,011,538 Class A ordinary shares out of a total of 55,200,000 Class A ordinary shares validly elected to redeem their shares and, accordingly, after giving effect to such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was approximately $216.8 million.
 On February 19, 2019, we consummated the business combination pursuant to which we (i) acquired each of Bonfire Interactive Ltd. (“Bonfire”), CityBase, Inc. (“CityBase”), eCivis Inc. (“eCivis”), Open Counter Enterprises Inc. (“Open Counter”), Questica Inc. and Questica USCDN Inc. (together, “Questica”). Until the Acquisition, GTY Cayman did not engage in any operations nor generate any revenues. 11,073,040 Class A ordinary shares were redeemed at a per share price of approximately $10.29 in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the business combination. In connection with the closing of the business combination, GTY Govtech, Inc. a Massachusetts corporation, became the parent company of and successor issuer by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to our predecessor entity, GTY Technology Holdings Inc., the Cayman Islands exempted company, and changed its name from GTY Govtech, Inc. to GTY Technology Holdings Inc.

 Upon the closing of the business combination, all outstanding Class A ordinary shares were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of common stock, and our outstanding warrants became exercisable for shares of common stock on the same terms as were contained in such warrants prior to the business combination.
 Legal Proceedings
 On November 19, 2018, GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“GTY” or the “Company”), Stephen J. Rohleder and Harry L. You commenced a lawsuit against OpenGov, Inc. (“OpenGov”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned GTY Technology Holdings Inc. et al. v. OpenGov, Inc., No. 18-cv-10854 (the “New York Action”), and on November 20, 2018, OpenGov commenced a lawsuit against the Company, the Company’s predecessor entity, GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company, GTY Technology Merger Sub, Inc., GTY Investors, LLC, Mr. You, Mr. Rohleder and Does 1-50 in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of San Mateo captioned OpenGov, Inc. v. GTY Technology Holdings Inc. et al., No. 18-cv-06264 (the “California Action”).
     On February 19, 2020, the parties to the New York Action and the California Action entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) to resolve all the pending claims in the New York Action and the California Action, without any admission or concession of wrongdoing by the Company or other defendants. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company paid OpenGov $3.3 million, net of amounts paid by the Company’s insurers, in exchange for a full and complete release of all claims that were or could have been asserted in the New York Action and the California Action.
     The following is a brief description of each of the business units we acquired in connection with the business combination.
 Bonfire Business Overview
 Bonfire Interactive Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, or Bonfire, was founded in 2012 and is a major provider of software technologies for the procurement and vendor or supplier sourcing industry across government, the broader public sector, and various highly-regulated commercial vertical markets.
 Bonfire offers clients and their sourcing professionals a modern software as a service (SaaS) application that helps find, engage, evaluate, negotiate with, and award contracts to suppliers. Bonfire delivers effective workflow automation, data collection and analysis, and collaboration to drive cost savings, compliance, and strategic outcomes. All of Bonfire’s applications are delivered as a SaaS offering.
 Industry Background
 The North American public sector represents a significant market for procurement technology. Various levels of government and public sector agencies’ procurement processes account for an estimated 12% of gross domestic product for both the United States and Canada, which equals approximately $2.5 trillion per year for the United States and Canada combined. Despite this magnitude, however, most of these spending decisions are made via paper, off-the-shelf spreadsheet technologies, and legacy internet-based sourcing portals.
 In total, the North American public sector market includes over 99,000 cities, counties, towns, and other local government special agencies, and over 17,000 public institutions in academia, public healthcare, transit,  utilities, and general state and federal agencies as of the most recent US Census of Governments. Despite differences in revenue sources, service delivery, and organizational mandates, each government body or entity shapes its sourcing practices in similar ways in response to state and federal procurement legislation and the emergence of various best practices.
 Each public body faces a similar challenge: how to procure the best good/service, for the best cost, within often rigid compliance and policy directives from elected bodies or other regulation.  This compliance- and policy-driven environment makes public sector procurement a significantly more complex and sensitive process than in the private sector. Public sector procurement teams are typically stewards of tax-payer resources, and are subjected to high sourcing scrutiny and ethics requirements. Such entities must balance competing interests like cost-savings, compliance, and quality to achieve uniquely positive outcomes.

 
  5
 

 Public sector procurement groups are more regularly transitioning tools from offline workflows to online SaaS-enabled platforms to fulfill this mandate. Legacy internet-based portals and procurement suites often fail to respect the complexities of making procurement decisions in a public sector context. Many are mere systems of record and rudimentary interface points for buyers and suppliers. Many more fail to help procurement teams with the key functionalities of managing and analyzing supplier data for optimal sourcing decisions.
 Bonfire uniquely captures the complexity and depth of public sector sourcing workflows; the software allows procurement teams to collect highly granular supplier data, analyze and evaluate it across discrete criteria, and ultimately help procurement teams make the best possible decision as a balance of compliance, cost-savings, and quality/fit.
 Products and Services
 Bonfire provides a comprehensive and flexible suite of products that addresses the procurement needs of predominantly public sector clients across academia, public healthcare, local and state government, transit, utilities, and various other state and federal agencies. Bonfire derives all of its revenues from subscription-based SaaS revenues.
 A description of Bonfire’s suites of products and services follows:

eRFx & eTendering |  Control for requests for proposals, or RFPs or RFx, and bids, streamlining the entire sourcing workflow from posting to award 
 |  Vendor-friendly online portal to post opportunities and receive structured submissions 
 |  Evaluation tools that give deep insights into suppliers’ relative strengths/weaknesses, pricing, and other areas 
 |  Real-time overview of projects and key performance indicators, or KPIs 
Contracts |  Contract information in one centralized, searchable, online platform 
 |  Heat-mapped calendar view, reminders and KPIs 
 |  Easy creation of contracts from completed projects 
Vendor Performance |  Visibility into vendor performance 
 |  Configure custom surveys for end users and set a cadence to automatically send 
 |  Real-time insights to address issues immediately 

      Strategy
 Bonfire’s objective is to grow its revenue and earnings organically, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions.  The key components of its business strategy are to:
    
· | Provide high quality, value-added products to its clients. Central to Bonfire’s success so far has been customer satisfaction and trust, as evidenced by a 93% client retention rate across clients added from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and net Annually Recurring Revenue, or ARR, churn of -7% for those same clients (i.e., Net Negative Churn). Bonfire expects that it will continue to invest heavily in client success. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to expand its product offerings. Bonfire intends to continue to build innovative new products for its clients. These include products that leverage the data stored in clients’ networks to help clients achieve better sourcing outcomes through predictive analytics, machine learning, blockchain, intra-agency collaboration, and other next-generation technologies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand its client base. Continued client growth is key for Bonfire’s strategy. Bonfire plans to continue building out its direct client acquisition strategy while adding strategic channel relationships to aid. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Attract and retain highly qualified employees. Bonfire’s business is dependent on attracting and retaining excellent managers and employees for product development, go-to-market, administrative, and support activities. Bonfire believes that its mission, scale of the opportunity, and unique culture will allow it to continue recruiting excellent staff. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  6
 


· | Pursue selected strategic acquisitions. Where appropriate, Bonfire plans to make strategic acquisitions of legacy portal providers as a way of quickening the adoption of Bonfire. This will allow Bonfire to grow revenues more rapidly than with a purely organic strategy, and to grow its supplier network and corresponding data. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sales, Marketing, And Clients
 Bonfire markets its products and services through direct, in-house sales and marketing personnel located in Canada and the United States.
 Sales of new systems are typically generated from outbound marketing and sales campaigns, tradeshows and conferences, word-of-mouth and referrals, and thought-leadership campaigns.
 Competition
 Bonfire competes with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions that it provides. Many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than Bonfire’s. Many of these firms operate within a specific geographic territory and/or are in a narrow product or service niche. Bonfire also competes with national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than Bonfire does, including SAP Ariba. Bonfire also occasionally competes with central internal information service departments of local governments, which requires it to persuade the end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to Bonfire.
 Bonfire competes on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation, technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client. Bonfire’s ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage. Local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process.
 Suppliers
 Substantially all of the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of Bonfire’s software systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. Bonfire has not experienced any significant supply problems. Research and Development
 Bonfire invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. Bonfire’s research and development team is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products. Intellectual Property, Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 Bonfire regards certain features of its internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential and proprietary and relies on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other measures to protect its proprietary intellectual property.  Bonfire currently does not rely on patents.  Bonfire believes that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability and experience of its employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of support services. Bonfire typically licenses its software products under non-exclusive license agreements, which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term. Employees
 At December 31, 2019, Bonfire had 108 full-time employees. None of its employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Bonfire considers its relations with its employees to be positive.

 Properties
 Bonfire leases and occupies approximately 21,000 square feet of office space in Ontario, Canada. Such lease expires on June 30, 2022.
 Government Regulation
 Upon reasonable investigation, we are not aware of any current government regulations that negatively impact Bonfire’s business or ability to compete in its markets.
 Legal Proceedings
 There are no legal proceedings pending to which Bonfire is party or to which any of its properties are subject.
 CityBase Business Overview
 CityBase provides dynamic content, digital services, and integrated payments via a software-as-a- service (SaaS) platform that includes functionality accessible via web and mobile, kiosk, point-of-sale, and other channels. CityBase software integrates its platform to underlying systems of record, billing, and other source systems, and configures payments and digital services to meet the requirements of its clients. Its clients include government agencies and utility companies. CityBase, LLC was formed in Delaware on June 9, 2014. On June 21, 2016, CityBase, LLC was converted into a Delaware corporation, CityBase, Inc.
 To complement and expand CityBase’s technology and customer base, on August 17, 2017, CityBase acquired 100% of the equity interests of the Department of Better Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in exchange for shares of CityBase common stock.
 Industry Background
 Currently, the government technology industry is composed of legacy technology vendors (which typically use significant customization for implementation), consulting firms, in-house development, and manual processes that have never been digitized. CityBase anticipates that government will follow the digital transformation of the private sector as constituents will expect such digitalization, and ultimately such digitalization is expected to yield cost reductions and improved service to constituents. CityBase also expects a continued momentum amongst government staff and leaders to modernize government services. This future is not defined, but facilitated by, technology and will revolutionize the way that people experience government. Product and Service Offerings
 CityBase provides an enterprise SaaS platform that facilitates government and utility interactions with customers. The key elements of its products and services are digital services and payments. Digital Services
 CityBase’s digital services make it easier for constituents to register, apply, search, and pay for government and utility services — and easier for staff to administer these services. “Digital services” includes solutions that address the common interactions that people have with the government or their utility provider, which are often paper-based today. CityBase digital services include configurable digital forms and case management tools that replace manual processes or improve existing online processes for government and utility customers. CityBase’s digital service tools help government and utility staff process constituent requests faster and more effectively. Payments
 The CityBase platform helps local governments and utilities accept, track, and manage payments from their constituents. CityBase facilitates payments that provide a modern user experience, integrate seamlessly with its customers’ existing systems, and are consistent across a large enterprise. The payment technology is available via channels, including 

 
  8
 
web and mobile web, kiosk, and point-of-sale terminals. Its revenue management solution allows clients to manage system-wide payment activity as well as reconcile to individual transactions in one place.
 Customers
 CityBase’s clients include local and county governments and investor or municipal utility companies. Four of CityBase’s customers accounted for approximately 78% and 72% of CityBase’s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Competition
 The market for enterprise payment, data analytics, and communication platforms for local governments and utilities is competitive and evolving. CityBase faces competition from several types of internal approaches and independent providers:
· | Custom software solutions developed by outside consultants or through internal efforts to provide partial- or full-suite offerings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Software vendors that have developed agency- or utility-specific systems for individual business cases, such as property tax payments, utility payments, or freedom of information requests;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other SaaS solution providers; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | Payment processing solution vendors serving government and utilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Competitive factors in CityBase’s market may include the following:

· | Service
--+--------


· | Price
--+------


· | Speed to implement
--+-------------------


· | Citizen-centric design
--+-----------------------


· | Configurability and flexibility
--+--------------------------------


· | Back office function for payment and banking reconciliation
--+------------------------------------------------------------

  CityBase believes that it compares favorably on the basis of these factors. Some of CityBase’s current competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater resources to devote to research and development, a broader range of products and services, larger marketing budgets, more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships, and/or longer operating histories, greater name recognition and other resources.
 Government Regulation
 As a contractor to various government agencies, CityBase is subject to certain restrictions in how it operates. Such restrictions may exist at the individual client level and may include regulations that govern the fees that CityBase collects for its services or the ability of the government counterparty to terminate its contractual obligations. Privacy and Data Security
 In addition, as a facilitator of credit card payments, CityBase is subject to privacy and data protection laws and payment card industry best practices. CityBase is a Payment Card Industry (PCI) Level-1 compliant service provider hosted in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment. CityBase takes a number of important measures to promote 

 
  9
 
data privacy and data security, including adhering to the standards and requirements, as defined by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), using tokenization, employing 24/7 fraud and tamper detection, real-time alerting, end-to-end encryption technology, and regularly scheduled internal and external penetration testing.
 Research and Development
 CityBase invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. CityBase’s research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products and platform. Intellectual Property
 The success of CityBase depends, in part, on its ability to protect its brands and technologies against infringement and misappropriation. CityBase relies on a combination of contractual restrictions, confidentiality procedures, trade secret laws and other measures to protect its proprietary intellectual property.  CityBase does not currently own any patents or hold other intellectual property registrations to protect its intellectual property.
 CityBase uses certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including software made available to the public under open source licenses. If any proprietary software does not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, CityBase believes that alternative software would be available, if necessary.
 CityBase cannot be certain that its products and services do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent claims against CityBase are successful, it may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue or modify certain products or services that are found to infringe another party’s rights.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, CityBase had 99 full-time employees. CityBase also utilizes independent contractors to support certain technical and other functions, including implementation engineers, which assist on all phases of the web-based project lifecycle, from project definition through implementation.
 CityBase employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and it has never experienced a work stoppage. CityBase believes that its relations with its employees are good.
 Facilities
 CityBase’s corporate headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois, where it currently leases approximately 14,560 square feet under a lease agreement set to expire in November 2021. In addition, CityBase subleases a Chicago, Illinois office to a non-related party under terms expiring on December 31, 2020. CityBase also leases a warehouse space in Illinois and co-working spaces in San Francisco, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Birmingham, Alabama. CityBase believes that its current facilities are adequate to meet its ongoing needs and that, to accommodate growth, it may seek additional facilities as necessary. Legal Proceedings
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against CityBase or any members of its management team in their capacity as such.
 eCivis Business Overview
 eCivis provides cloud-based grants management and cost allocation software for state, local and tribal governments and other government entities. eCivis helps thousands of public agencies maximize their grant revenues, track financial and program performance, prepare cost allocation plans and budgets, and access free open data tools to make sense of federal data. eCivis’s solutions simplify grant pursuance, proposal development, budgeting, program implementation, performance, reporting, compliance and management of subrecipients in one single centralized enterprise system. eCivis was founded in Pasadena, California in 2000 with the help of local government leaders at the International City/County Management Association (ICMA). 

 
  10
 

 Industry Background
 eCivis has identified a major inefficiency in the flow of government funding between state and federal government and businesses, individuals and various local government entities. The grant funding process is inefficient, with the majority of local governments lacking essential human and technical resources to pursue and manage the grant process. Instead, staff members without formal training often attempt to fit grants management into their already heavy workload, without access to standardized forms, tools or processes, resulting in inefficient strategy and lost opportunities for funding. Data and information is rarely standardized and is entered into common back office tools such as spreadsheets and outdated grant management systems without comprehensive tracking and integration functions. Furthermore, currently- existing fund management systems are unable to monitor the proper use of funds, leading to significant mismanagement and even risk of loss and misappropriation of funds. Competitive grants are time sensitive and require immediate attention whereas procurement and internal sources take time to be approved. eCivis provides products and services that can be deployed quickly and with little technical support to address the time sensitive nature of these grant funds.
 eCivis’s Products and Services
 The eCivis solution consists of three core cloud-based products  including eCivis Grants  Network©,a full lifecycle SaaS grants management solution consisting of grants acquisition  software, grantee management software, and grantor  management software, eCivis AllocateTM, a SaaS cost allocation solution, and FundMaxTM, a full-service solution designed to maximize federal and non-federal  funds, including maximizing cost reimbursements using a suite of innovative digital tools and expert support. eCivis also offers one-time implementation services including data integration, grants data migration and change management. Additionally, eCivis provides ongoing grants management training and cost allocation plan development and consulting.
 eCivis Grants Network©; Grants Acquisition Software
 eCivis Grants Network©; Grantee Acquisition Software provides clients with the ability to manage the entire planning and grant pursuance process by integrating each step from project creation to grant award, so that stakeholders can eliminate unnecessary steps and systems required to secure the right funding for their projects.

The platform provides clients with the ability to search over 16,000 federal, state and foundation grants, all identified, analyzed and summarized by eCivis’s full-time professional research staff. Such grants can be searched with an easy to use advanced multi-factor search engine and reviewed via organized standard tabs to effectively identify the most relevant grants. Users can review application files and e-mail grants to internal and external recipients, as well as save and/or assign grants to internal projects. Built-in compliance tools help determine and confirm whether internal proposals and costs align with applicable federal and non-federal guidelines. eCivis Grants Network©; Grantee Management Software
 eCivis Grants Network©; Grantee Management Software Solution allows users to manage the entire grant process, from sourcing grant application to closeout as a grantee. Some of the key features of the Grants Management Software Solution include the ability to: organize projects and grants by organizational departments, review an enterprise-wide view of all grant activities, and access advanced workflows and robust management reporting systems. Users can build and save template reports for internal and external reporting, setup required tasks at various post-award stages, integrate project tasks with e-mail calendars, manage the communication and approval of budget amendments, and access a myriad of other features and functions. Users are also able to organize and connect financial data to and from enterprise resource planning (“ERP”)/GL against grant budgets using data integration functions — over thirty data integrations with government ERP/GL are provided to serve this function. Additionally, eCivis also maps compliance requirements into standard available actions across the entire grant lifecycle, and provides a library of resource that can be accessed at any time to understand 2 CFR 200 guidelines. eCivis Grants Network©; Grantor Management Software
 eCivis Grants Network©; Grantor Management Software provides grantors and its applicants and grantees with the opportunity to interact with each other in a modern and scaleable platform. Today’s grant portals are not built to make the experience great for the grantor and the grantee. A grantor solution will track performance history, organize reimbursement 

 
  11
 
requests, streamline communication, manage reporting requirements to support payments to deliver transparency of all grantee activities across all of your departments and agencies. Some of the key features of this platform include the ability to create and track grant solicitation, score and record decisions on applicants, check eligibility data, track application history, track and share performance metrics for grant goals and/or objectives, allocate and track multiple funding sources, track all pre-award grant activity by department, project, CFDA, etc., as well as a wide range of other features.
 eCivis AllocateTM; Cost Allocation Software
 eCivis AllocateTM tracks and compares expenditures and allocation basis by fiscal years, and provides a concise methodology for budgeting and program delivery planning. The platform allows users to: maximize efficiency by minimizing time spent entering and reviewing data and producing cost and plans reports, maximize grant and program funding through full and complete cost recovery and allocation, provide a clear and concise methodology to assist in developing budgets and planning program delivery, and determine full, defensible, indirect costs to include in ICRPs, hour rates, user fees, and SB90 claims.
 eCivis FundMaxTM; Cost Allocation Software
 eCivis FundMaxTM is a full-service solution designed to maximize federal and non-federal funds, including maximizing cost reimbursements using a suite of innovative digital tools and expert support.  The reimbursements from FundMaxTM can generate the required funding to properly implement and utilize eCivis solutions.
 Consulting and Training
 eCivis’s team of experienced consultants and support staff provide training to improve planning, acquisition and effective management of federal and non-federal grants. Further, eCivis’s strategic grant development  and grant writing service helps stakeholders develop a comprehensive solution leading to sustainable  grant success by helping clients, among other things: (i) thoroughly understand key initiatives and internal projects eligible for grant funding, (ii) research grants that align to internal initiatives and organizational priorities to fill existing gaps, (iii) access organizational capacity to apply for grants successfully, (iv) align internal procurement processes and resources to pursue grant opportunities in a more efficient and effective way, and (v) draft grant proposals  and provide strategic advice and consulting services to shape priorities per grant funding notices. Finally, the platform also offers a wide array of expert guides and other resources to its users. Revenues, Sales and Marketing
 eCivis derives its revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. No single contract or customer represents a disproportionate percentage of revenue. eCivis’s subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that provide customers access to either its grant management or cost allocation cloud applications. Such subscriptions are typically one to three years in length, and are priced based on a number of factors, including the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. eCivis’s professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for data integration with the customer’s systems and the eCivis grant management application, migration of grants, training, and grant writing services.
 eCivis focuses its sales and marketing efforts towards local, state and tribal governments and sells its solution to this market primarily through its direct sales force. The length of its sales cycle depends on the size of the potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased.  The sales cycle of its state government customer is generally longer than that of its local government customers. As eCivis continues to focus on increasing its average contract size and selling more advanced products, it expects its sales cycle to lengthen and become less predictable, which could cause variability in results for a particular period. Additionally, the nature, complexity and extent of its implementations will also increase, which may increase eCivis’s professional services revenues as a percentage of its overall revenues.
 Research and Development
 eCivis has spent approximately $1.5 million and $1.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on research and development activities.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, eCivis had 60 full-time employees. eCivis also employs independent contractors to support grant services, web development, research publishing and editing, fit-gap analysis, change management, implementation services and marketing.  eCivis’s employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and eCivis has never experienced a work stoppage. eCivis believes that its relations with its employees are good. Facilities
 eCivis’s headquarters are located in a multi-tenant office building at 418 N. Fair Oaks Ave., Ste. 301, Pasadena, CA 91103, where eCivis leases approximately 10,030 rentable square feet. eCivis’s lease for such space expires on May 31, 2022.

 Open Counter Business Overview
 Open Counter builds software to streamline municipal permitting and licensing through four products: the Business Portal, Residential Portal, Special Events Portal, and Zoning Portal.  These products help applicants understand the scope of their permitting projects, and apply and pay for the necessary permits online. The portals also allow city administrators to process incoming applications and respond to applicant inquiries online. By automating these processes, the software reduces the need for in-person meetings, and allows city staff to focus on higher-value assignments. Open Counter’s Products and Services
 Open Counter offers four products:  Business Portal, Residential Portal, Special Events Portal, and Zoning Portal.

· | The Business Portal helps entrepreneurs understand the costs and complexity of establishing or growing a business in a particular city. The Open Counter Business Portal educates potential applicants about necessary business permits, and provides estimates about the associated time and costs associated with a particular project. Once applicants are ready to proceed with a project, they can use the Business Portal to apply online for necessary permits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Residential Portal educates homeowners about the rules and regulations regarding residential additions, alterations, and new construction to help plan projects and remain in compliance with city code enforcement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Special Events Portal helps applicants understand the process involved in hosting a special event in a public space by handling site selection, cost estimation, event scheduling, and online applications. The Special Events Portal provides a high-level overview tool to educate users about which types of events are allowed, where events may be located, which permits are required, and cost estimates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | The Zoning Portal renders complex land use regulations in a user’s web browser to make zoning regulations responsive to citizen inquiries. Specifically, the Zoning Portal helps applicants navigate the site selection process by showing where a particular project may be permitted. The Portal analyzes and imports the logical structure of the municipal code, and factors secondary issues, such as whether a restaurant may serve alcohol, or have live entertainment, in order to provide tailored guidance about a specific project. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As part of the deployment of these products, Open Counter also offers configuration services to set up and maintain the Portals on behalf of our municipal customers.
 Competition
 There are a number of companies that offer permitting and licensing software to municipal governments. These include Accela, Infor, and Tyler, among others. These companies built their software with an emphasis on the requirements of city staff users, with a lesser emphasis on the applicant experience.
 By focusing on the applicant experience, Open Counter found a unique niche in the market: permit discovery. While the competition allows applicants to submit permit and license applications online, their software typically assumes that the applicant knows which permits and licenses are required, and the costs of those permits and licenses. In contrast, Open Counter’s software guides the applicant through the permit discovery process by calculating the impact of applicable zoning regulations on the choice of location and planned use, the permits required for the project, and the necessary permit fees. Open Counter’s software also alerts applicants about the professional licensure requirements for specific permits, such as whether a licensed contractor, electrician or plumber is needed on their project team. By automating these determinations, Open Counter has addressed an in-person step referred to as a “pre-application meeting,” which is a time-consuming step for both applicants and city staff.
 Because Open Counter is offered as a SaaS solution, its annual pricing is significantly lower than the legacy systems, which have traditionally offered on-premises software under perpetual license agreements.
 Some of Open Counter’s competition provide permit discovery products that explain the permitting process in general terms. While helpful, these materials do not provide information tailored to specific projects. For example, a restaurant with outdoor seating, live entertainment, and alcohol service may require a different set of permits (with higher costs), than one without those options.  Many cities offer PDF documents with this kind of information. For example, San Francisco and Los Angeles offer detailed “Business Portals,” but they are still based on static content.
 By focusing on permit discovery, Open Counter has remained agnostic to the back-end systems used by cities. This means that we can launch Open Counter products in cities using Accela, Infor, or Tyler, and other competitors, without coming into direct competition with offerings from those companies.
 Research and Development
 Open Counter spent approximately $400,000 during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 on research and development activities. None of such costs are borne by customers.
 Organization
 As of December 31, 2019, Open Counter had 18 full-time employees. None of Open Counter’s employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with Open Counter. Open Counter believes that its relations with its employees are good. Facilities
 Open Counter’s headquarters is located at 25 Taylor Street, San Francisco, California.  Open Counter is not party to any lease agreements.

 Questica offers budgeting software, performance management, and transparency and data visualization solutions throughout North America. Questica was founded by TJ Parass in Ontario, Canada in 1998. Questica uses its 20 years of experience to provide public sector organizations with access to a complete budgeting, performance, transparency and citizen engagement toolkit to better enable data-driven budgeting and decision-making, while increasing data accuracy, saving time and improving stakeholder trust. Questica’s solutions are sold to 719 customers as of December 31, 2019, which include state and local governments and public sector organizations such as healthcare, education and not-for-profit organizations. Questica’s Products and Services
 Questica has four primary products: (i) Budget; (ii) Performance; (iii) OpenBook; and (iv) BudgetBook powered by CaseWare.
 Budget
 Questica’s Budget is a web-based, multi-user budgeting preparation and management solution that provides all budgeting software requirements in one easy-to-access place. Budget is a comprehensive, streamlined budgeting software product that enables users to improve and shorten an organization’s budgeting cycle by ensuring an accurate and collaborative multi-user budgeting process. It provides multi-year capital budgeting, identifies expenditures and funding sources, provides salary and position planning and performance management modules, allows the generation of new financial statements, enables advanced analytics and provides an integrated dashboard that shows all critical data and other relevant information together in an interactive interface. Budget directly and seamlessly integrates with Questica’s other products, which are described below, as well as the Balancing Act budget simulator created by Engaged Public, a Colorado-based public policy consulting firm which has partnered with Questica since August 2018. Performance
 Questica’s Performance is a management performance measurement tool which permits users to obtain a complete view of performance across an organization. Performance, which can integrate with Budget, leverages financial and statistical data from an unlimited number of budget and non-budget key performance indicators to effectively measure performance by tracking an organization’s progress and achieving set goals. Performance can incorporate data from a variety of other sources such as ERP systems.
 OpenBook
 Questica’s OpenBook is a data visualization software that enables the presentation of financial and non-financial data with descriptive text, informational pop-ups, charts and graphs and includes fast information search functionality. OpenBook, which can integrate with Budget, can display on a map capital infrastructure projects, including the budget, actual spend, funding sources and accompanying documentation, images, video and other multimedia.  By facilitating the sharing and communication of financials and other data, OpenBook is used by organizations to communicate strategic plans, fundraising and community initiatives, disclose to citizens how tax dollars are spent, and engage with stakeholders 

 
  15
 
regarding plans, projects and issues. Organizations can also link related activities to showcase the depth and scope of capital projects that are happening in a city, region, state, province or country.
 Budget Book powered by CaseWare
 Questica’s Budget Book powered by CaseWare is a user-friendly and comprehensive document management and financial reporting tool that allows government agencies to create, collaborate, edit, approve and publish annual budget books. Budget Book integrates with Budget and provides access to Questica’s partnership with CaseWare, a government financial reporting database product.  The budget book standards for the Government Financial Officers Association’s annual Distinguished Budget Presentation Award were used to develop the standard budget book preparation model for Budget Book’s interface, permitting small and mid-sized agencies to prepare professional and compliant budget books that might be otherwise too time and resource intensive to produce.
 Competition
 The competitive landscape for budgeting software, performance management, and transparency and data visualization solutions varies depending on the type of solution, the size of the organizations to be served and the geographical locations in which such organizations operate, but in most cases the solutions with which Questica competes are ERP solutions, Microsoft’s Excel and home-grown solutions designed by the organizations themselves.
 Questica believes the principal competitive factors in its markets include:

· | Cost
--+-----


· | Technology
--+-----------


· | User Interface
--+---------------


· | Customer Service
--+-----------------


· | Integration
--+------------


· | Public Sector Focus and Expertise
--+----------------------------------


· | Product Breadth
--+----------------


· | Implementation Track Record
--+----------------------------

  Questica believes that it competes favorably based on these factors.
 While there are a number of competitors seeking to provide such solutions, the primary competitors include Oracle’s Hyperion Planning, Sherpa, ClearGov, Public Sector Digest Software, MyBudgetFile, Allovue Balance, Adaptive Insights, Kaufman Hall, OpenGov and Centage’s Budget Maestro, which each compete to differing degrees across the spectrum of organizations, geographical locations and vertical markets in which Questica operates. Questica has emerged as a market leader or strong market participant for each type of solution that it provides among these primary competitors.
 Questica has focused its competition on establishing relationships with potential customers as early in the process as possible through cold calling, email campaigns, trade show attendance and sponsorships, web marketing, partner referrals and Questica-sponsored regional events. Questica leverages existing customer references and its broad knowledge and understanding of the public sector and the unique budgeting challenges these customers face to compete with its primary competitors. Questica additionally differentiates itself by solely focusing its product development on the public sector and does not sell or market its products into any other types of customers.
 Questica has a sales organization that sells its products, sometimes working with referral partners who sell complimentary solutions. In addition, Questica utilizes distribution relationships with partners who sell, implement and 

 
  16
 
provides basic support services to customers and has a number of referral arrangements with partners who introduce Questica’s products to their customers and receive a referral fee for Questica contracts.
 Questica has 719 customers using its solutions and is not dependent on any one customer with no customers representing more than 10% of total revenues during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 Research and Development
 Questica regularly introduces new product offerings, including BudgetBook powered by CaseWare, which was introduced in late 2017. Questica spent approximately $2.0 million and $1.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on research and development activities. Very little of such costs are borne by customers. Questica has a small group of developers who work with its professional services and implementation team. The cost of these development resources is not included in the annual research and development spend, and this team builds customizations and integrations funded by customers as billable jobs and deliverables. Organization
 As of December 31, 2019, Questica had 112 full-time employees. None of Questica’s employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with Questica. Questica believes that its relations with its employees are good. Facilities
 Questica leases four facilities for key administrative, operational and technology functions. Questica’s headquarters are located in a multi-tenant office building in Burlington, Ontario, Canada at 980 Fraser Drive, Unit 105, where Questica leases 7,000 square feet. Questica’s lease for the space in Burlington commenced on June 1, 2015 and expires on March 31, 2020. Starting on March 1, 2017, Questica also leased 3,410 square feet in a second property in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, which lease ends on March 31, 2020. Starting on June 20, 2017, Questica leased 2,085 square feet in Huntington Beach, California, which lease ends on March 31, 2023. In August 2019, Questica entered into a leasing agreement located at 603 Michigan Drive, Oakville, Ontario.  The lease commenced on January 1, 2020 and expires on December 31, 2031. The total square feet under lease is 22,170. Questica does not own any facilities as of the date of this filing. Questica believes that substantially all of its property and equipment is in good condition and its buildings and improvements have sufficient capacity to meet current needs. Intellectual Property
 Questica does not hold any patents but has registered trademarks for “QUESTICA” and “TEAMBUDGET” in the U.S. and Canada and has applied for trademarks for “OPENBOOK” and “WHERE BRILLIANT BEGINS” in the U.S. and Canada. Government Regulation
 There are no current government regulations that negatively impact Questica’s business or Questica’s ability to compete in the markets it pursues. However, there are regulations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that are relevant to Questica’s customers that could in the future necessitate changes to Questica’s products in order to be compliant, and if not addressed, could negatively impact Questica’s ability to compete for new business. Legal Proceedings
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against Questica or any members of its management team in their capacity as such.
 Sherpa Business Overview
 Sherpa is a leading provider of public sector budgeting software and consulting services that help state and local governments create and manage budgets and performance. Clients purchase Sherpa software as a subscription or perpetual 

 
  17
 
license and engage Sherpa consulting services to configure the software and train clients on how to manage the software going forward.  Following the implementation, clients continue to use the software in perpetuity while paying maintenance or subscription fees.
 Sherpa’s clients benefit from a system that greatly simplifies the budgeting process, encourages collaboration and provides detailed projections on substantial portions of their budgets. Increased access to data, including instant aggregation of the budget requests, means clients can spend more time analyzing data and less time collecting it and formatting outputs. Sherpa’s business consulting provides access to lessons learned from over 100 public sector budgeting implementations and consultants who average 20 years of experience in budgeting and performance management.
 Sherpa’s contracts are comprised of two durations: (i) short-term implementation of three to twelve months; and (ii) on-going maintenance of one to five year renewable periods. Due to the investment made in implementing software and the quality of the solution, retention rates are very high.
 Industry Background
 Public sector budgeting has been traditionally performed by either disparate spreadsheet that are compiled by a central office or home-grown systems. Due to the sheer amount of data and publication requirements needed by public sector organizations, using this traditional process can be very challenging. Most budget processes experience a significant amount of data re-entry and re-stating, manual compilation and extensive data verification and often rely on the mostly manual preparation of required publications. While products that meet some budgeting software requirements exist in the market, many are overly complicated to implement or priced at a point that exceeds the reservation points of most government organizations. Sherpa’s product is flexible enough to meet complex requirements while also scalable to lower budget clients. Sherpa’s Products and Services
 Sherpa provides public sector budgeting software to meet the needs of key stakeholders, executive and legislative branches, budget offices and department users. The key elements of Sherpa’s offerings are: (i) a highly configurable software; (ii) an experienced consulting team; and (iii) a long-term support model. Highly Configurable Software
 Sherpa’s software was designed to be configured by functional staff with no changes to the underlying code. Implementation teams are comprised of functional experts, not technical experts, who are able to understand business requirements and demonstrate configured software immediately after requirements meetings. This means clients see their future solution throughout the process and can make refinements without having to wait for an entire build phase to complete. Consulting
 Each of the members of Sherpa’s consulting team have an average of over 20 years of targeted public sector budgeting experience and together have implemented over 100 public sector budgeting projects. This experience is invaluable to clients for several reasons. Clients can quickly explain their processes and Sherpa’s team will understand without multiple iterations, meaning clients dedicate a significantly lower amount of their time to engagements. When clients seek advice, Sherpa can refer them to dozens of relevant examples where other similar clients have faced similar challenges. Sherpa has many innovative clients whose collective thought leadership is channeled through Sherpa’s implementation team. Sherpa’s team has seen what has worked and what has not, so Sherpa can offer counsel on business processes redesign including recommended timing relative to the software project. Support
 Sherpa’s support model is designed to enable clients to use Sherpa’s software for the long term, traversing changes in leadership, policy, and staff. As part of Sherpa’s basic maintenance model, clients can reach out to their consulting team at any time to get assistance, answers to questions or support with activities that are rarely done, such as annual rollovers. This results in clients getting answers to questions immediately, without the struggles of reporting issues through a chain of support staff who are not familiar with the client processes and configuration.

 Revenues
 Sherpa currently earn revenues from three main sources: (i) consulting services for implementations and business process design; (ii) software fees; and (iii) maintenance fees. Consulting services are comprised of one-time implementation fees and system administrator services, where Sherpa serves as the customer’s system administrator, typically to provide coverage for turnover. Software fees are made up of both perpetual license fees and subscription fees. Maintenance fees are annual fees paid by perpetual license customers to have access to customer support and software upgrades.  Hosting services are also provided but are mostly pass-through to Sherpa’s hosting providers. Sherpa generally relies on approximately 21 customers for each of its three main revenue sources in a given fiscal year, which are mostly comprised of state and local governments. Sales and Marketing
 Sherpa’s primary method of securing sales to date is through responses to requests for proposals.  In addition, Sherpa’s target audience actively communicates with similar public sector organizations, which leads to word-of-mouth sales. To grow sales beyond responses to requests for proposals and word-of-mouth referrals, Sherpa employs the following sales and marketing strategies:
· | Limited conferences where decision-makers attend;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Pre-sales work to introduce clients to Sherpa’s offering; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Selling via cooperative agreements.
--+------------------------------------

  Revenue Growth
 Sherpa’s primary focus for revenue growth is to ensure Sherpa’s current customer base maintains a high degree of customer satisfaction.  Sherpa believes that high retention of recurring revenue is critical to create the foundation for revenue growth. Sherpa also believes that high customer satisfaction provides secondary benefits, including strong references and willingness to promote the product and team. Growing Existing Markets
 Sherpa’s goals for growth focus on verticals with which Sherpa has had the most success: cities, counties and states. Sherpa’s targeted market of large, complex clients has a total available market of 450 counties, 300 cities, 49 states and 600 state agencies as of December 31, 2019. There are 280 K-12 opportunities, which Sherpa pursues selectively due to their unique requirements. New Markets
 There are additional verticals where Sherpa’s product applies, such as K-12, universities, and non-profits which may be considered for long-term growth.
 Technology and Operations
 Sherpa’s technology leverages Microsoft’s widely-used SQL Server, which is a relational database management system, and .NET software framework.  The power of Sherpa’s application is derived from Sherpa’s investment in on-screen configuration, all of which is stored in the database, meaning code updates do not have client-specific features. Since each client has unique requirements which must be met due to statutory requirements or policy, Sherpa’s solution was built to be flexible enough to meet these requirements without code changes or client customizations. With Sherpa’s experience with multiple other budgeting systems, Sherpa’s product was built from the ground up with the specific focus on how to create outputs in an efficient manner.  This means regardless of reporting solution, reports are fast and easy to create due to the strong design.
 Sherpa’s technology infrastructure for hosted clients is provided by Amazon Web Services and is maintained by Sherpa’s partner at Smart Panda Labs. We have east coast and west coast hosting sites. Approximately half of Sherpa’s customer base is serviced on-premise. Budgeting is not mission critical, but Sherpa’s objective is to provide uninterrupted 

 
  19
 
service 24 hours per day and seven days a week, and Sherpa’s operations maintain extensive backup, security and disaster recovery procedures including recovery in 8 minute intervals.
 Sherpa’s solutions are scalable and can be set up quickly for new clients. The average time to stand up a new environment is less than one day. Due to low incidences of system issues, most clients take upgrades only once per year, allowing them to complete their budget cycle uninterrupted.
 Competition
 Nearly every competitive request for proposals in the budget space will have ten or more bidders. Historically, very few are truly competitive across all scoring areas. Sherpa believes that the principal factors upon which its businesses compete are:
· | Software capabilities — Sherpa’s software generally meets over 98% of requirements
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implementation team experience — Sherpa’s team members average 20 years of targeted experience
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Support model — Sherpa’s clients have direct contact with Sherpa’s implementation team without a tiered support model
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | References — References are strong, with surveys resulting in a 9.9/10 average score
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Price — Sherpa is generally in the 40th percentile in pricing among competitors for large to mid-sized clients
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sherpa believes Sherpa competes favorably with respect to all of the above-listed factors. Sherpa’s main competitors are much larger than Sherpa and have an advantage in name recognition.  However, Sherpa believes that in public sector budgeting most decision makers are focused on procuring the best possible product and rarely factor in company size once they are satisfied with the long-term prospects of the offering.
 All of Sherpa’s prospective clients have preexisting financial and human resources solutions, meaning that Sherpa also faces competition with legacy product offerings. Companies such as SAP and Oracle have a substantial market share of financial and human resources software, which means they can up-sell their products, often without formal procurements. Sherpa has found, however, that most clients are not satisfied with enterprise resource planning budget products and are moving to best-in-breed for products such as budgeting, grants and procurement.
 Sherpa’s primary competitors in the market vary by client size:

· | Large, complex clients with over $2 billion in budget; competitors are larger, established companies such as Questica, Oracle, SAP and CGI. Integrators include Deloitte, Accenture for Oracle and SAP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mid-sized clients with between $500 million to $2 billion in budget; Questica and lower-priced integrators of expensive products such as Oracle or scaled-down offerings of the more expensive products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Smaller clients with less than $500 million in budget: Sherpa does not currently compete in this space, but there is more competition at this level due to price sensitivity. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Research and Development
 Research and development is performed as part of Sherpa’s efforts to constantly improve our product. Our Research and Development expenditures were approximately $300,000 during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, Sherpa had 11 employees. Sherpa also employs independent contractors to support Sherpa’s hosting environments. Sherpa’s employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and Sherpa has never experienced a work stoppage. Sherpa believes that its relations with its employees are good. Facilities
 Sherpa does not own or lease any facilities as of the date of this filing. Sherpa employees work remotely out of their homes or at co-working facilities. Government Regulation
 There are no current government regulations that negatively impact Sherpa’s business or ability to compete in its markets. However, there are regulations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that are relevant to Sherpa’s customers that could in the future necessitate changes to Sherpa’s products in order to be compliant, and if not addressed, could negatively impact Sherpa’s ability to compete for new business. Legal Proceedings
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against Sherpa or any members of its management team in their capacity as such.
