Item 1. Business
    On March 13, 2015, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P. (which is referred to, along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding us and other companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity, as Lone Star) acquired the building products business of HeidelbergCement AG, or HC, in the United States and Eastern Canada, or the Acquisition. Unless otherwise specified or where the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “our,” “we,” “us,” the “Company” and “our business” refer to the operations of Forterra, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware in 2016. We are controlled by Lone Star and have been operating as a stand-alone company since 2015. 
Recent Developments
    On February 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Quikrete Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, or Quikrete, and Jordan Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quikrete, or Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, or the Merger, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quikrete. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Company (other than (i) any shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Quikrete, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) shares that are subject to any vesting restrictions, or Company Restricted Shares granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans, (iii) any shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $24.00 in cash, without interest, or the Merger Consideration, subject to deduction for any required withholding tax. We and Quikrete are currently working with the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, to obtain approval to consummate the Merger under the Hart-Scot-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act, in the timeframe contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
    In order to address some of the divestitures anticipated to be required by the DOJ, we have entered into two divestiture agreements. On November 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Eagle Corporation and Parent pursuant to which Eagle will purchase our 50% equity interest in Concrete Pipe & Precast, LLC, or CP&P, a 50/50 joint venture with Eagle, for a purchase price of $105 million, subject to certain adjustments as described in the purchase agreement. On December 13, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Hydro Conduit, LLC d/b/a Rinker Materials, an affiliate of Parent, and Foley Products Company, Inc. pursuant to which we and Rinker will each sell to Foley certain assets and liabilities associated with reinforced concrete pipe and precast plants for an aggregate purchase price of $95 million, subject to certain adjustments described in the asset purchase agreement. Consummation of these transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the consummation of the Merger and approval by the DOJ.
    See Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in "Overview" for a more fulsome description of the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the risks related thereto and its terms and expected impact on our business.
General
    We are a manufacturer of concrete pipe and precast products and ductile iron pipe in the United States and Eastern Canada for a variety of essential water-related infrastructure applications. Our products and services are used in the construction, maintenance, repair and replacement of water drainage, distribution and transmission systems. 
    We operate 80 active manufacturing facilities, and our manufacturing and distribution network allows us to serve most major markets in the United States and Eastern Canada.
    We manufacture both water drainage pipe and precast structures (used primarily for storm water and drainage applications) and water transmission and distribution pipe (used primarily to transport potable water and as a component of wastewater systems) and believe our complementary product portfolio is well positioned to serve both (i) the storm water and wastewater infrastructure market and (ii) the potable water transmission and distribution market. We serve a diverse set of end markets, including infrastructure, residential, and non-residential construction, which allows us to benefit from both secular and cyclical growth across each of these end-markets. The infrastructure, residential, and non-residential end markets in the United States and Eastern Canada have different growth drivers and operating dynamics, and the cyclical performance of these markets has historically been staggered during different stages of the broader economic cycle serving to mitigate the cyclical impact of any one single market on our business. In addition, given the nature of water as a basic necessity, municipalities generally repair and replace their existing water and wastewater infrastructure.
     Our operational strategy is focused on our five improvement pillars:
•Health and Safety — Prioritizing the health and safety of our employees above anything else; our most productive facilities should be our safest
•Plant-level Operational Discipline — Making daily improvements using our manufacturing/process know-how to drive efficiencies with disciplined financial investment
•Enhanced Commercial Capabilities—Investing in our sales force to expand capabilities and better inform our customers of our compelling value proposition
•Working Capital Efficiency—Having the right levels of inventory in the right places at the right times and aligning our accounts receivable and accounts payable cycles
•G&A Effectiveness—Delivering deeper information faster and at a lower cost so operators can make better business decisions
Our solid execution on these five pillars has produced, and we believe will continue to produce, the earnings and cash flows that have allowed us to reach our stated net leverage goal of 3.0x to 3.5x earnings during 2021 and we believe will allow us to continue reducing our leverage over time. Our organic growth strategy is focused on leveraging our operations, customer service and product innovation capabilities, as well as our product breadth and scale, to sell our products to existing customers, to increase penetration and project wins and to gain market share through new customers. Operationally, we continue to focus on efficiency and productivity improvements to reduce costs and drive unit margin improvements. We periodically evaluate our existing business and acquisition opportunities to complement our organic growth or enhance our scale, geographic footprint and product portfolio while simultaneously considering and making strategic divestitures or changes in our manufacturing footprint to optimize our portfolio. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our recent acquisitions and divestitures.
Our Segments
    Drainage Pipe & Products. We are the largest producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products by sales volume in the United States and Eastern Canada. In addition, we also produce concrete pressure pipe in Eastern Canada. We operate 65 active manufacturing facilities across multiple states and two Canadian provinces. These facilities provide us with a local presence and the necessary proximity to our customers to minimize delivery times and distribution costs to the markets we serve. We believe our product offering creates value for our customers as it eliminates the need to engage multiple suppliers of storm water and wastewater-related products for a single project, enabling them to maximize efficiency and meet more aggressive timetables. We also have the ability to custom-build products to complex specifications and regulations. 
Drainage pipe has residential, non-residential and infrastructure applications. It is primarily used for storm water applications, such as storm drains for roads and highways, and for residential and non-residential site developments. In addition, drainage pipe is used for sanitary sewers, low-pressure sewer force mains, tunneled systems, treatment plant piping and utility tunnels.
    Water Pipe & Products. We are the largest producer of ductile iron pipe, or DIP, by sales volume in the United States. Utilizing the U.S. Pipe brand, we manufacture a number of products used for the transmission of potable water and wastewater in pipe diameters typically ranging from three to 64 inches. Our product breadth and depth and our technical service address a range of our customers' water transmission and distribution needs. Our 15 manufacturing facilities are located across the United States, with swing capacity available to support increased production levels as appropriate to satisfy increased demand.

Our Industry and Core End Markets
    We serve a range of infrastructure-related end markets. Based on the source of funding, we classify these construction markets into infrastructure/municipal, residential and non-residential.
Infrastructure
    Infrastructure represents spending by federal, state, and local governments for the construction and repair of streets, highways, storm and sanitary sewers, as well as the construction and repair of water lines for the delivery of potable water, which are often supported by multi-year federal and state legislation and programs. It also includes local municipalities water infrastructure spending associated with the construction, repair and replacement of water transportation and distribution systems. Spending on these items is driven by federal, state and municipal funding for both new build and repair projects. In addition to availability of funding at the federal, state and municipal levels, these programs are impacted by other factors, including demographic and population shifts and the ability of contractors to obtain skilled labor. 
    A large proportion of U.S. water infrastructure is approaching, or has already reached, the end of its useful life. According to The American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, many drinking water pipes in the U.S. were laid from 1900 to 1950. Today, aging pipelines contribute to the estimated 240,000 water main breaks per year in the U.S., wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water. Additionally, lead pipes and fixtures, which were commonly installed through the mid-20th century, are still in service in some cities. The American Water Works Association estimated that the need for buried drinking water infrastructure in the U.S. through 2050 totals nearly $1.7 trillion, about 54% of which is needed for replacement of existing infrastructure and the balance being necessary to accommodate population growth and migration over that period. ASCE gave the U.S. 
wastewater infrastructure a grade of D+ and, in 2017, estimated that 56 million new users would be connected to centralized treatment systems over the next 15 years requiring at least $271 billion to meet current and future demands and to upgrade existing infrastructure. Likewise, the ASCE grades the U.S. surface transportation (roads, bridges, and transit) infrastructure D/C+/D- and has identified over $1 trillion in additional spending needed to repair and upgrade existing structures as well as construction of new facilities to accommodate growth through 2025. As the leader in our respective markets serving the water related infrastructure industry, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this much needed spending to repair and upgrade U.S. infrastructure.
Residential Construction
    Residential construction includes single family homes and multi-family units such as apartments and condominiums. In this end market, our products are primarily used during the new lot development phase of construction. New residential housing starts provide a strong leading indicator of increased activity in the residential construction market for water transmission, wastewater and drainage systems. Demand for residential construction is influenced by demographic and population shifts, mortgage interest rates, and the ability of builders to obtain skilled labor. U.S. residential new construction peaked in 2006 before experiencing a downturn from 2007 to 2011. Since 2011, the recovery of residential new construction has translated into increased demand for our products and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize as and to the extent this trend continues. Since 1974, annual additions to the housing supply exceeded household growth by an average of 30% to accommodate replacement of older units, demand for second homes, geographic shifts in the population, and a normal amount of vacancies. However, for most of the last decade, housing production has barely kept pace with household formation. We believe this indicates there is significant pent up demand for housing and that the market will see continued growth. 
Non-residential Construction
Non-residential construction includes all privately financed construction other than residential structures. Revenues in this end-market are driven largely by new United States non-residential construction, for which demand is generally driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. Our products in this end market tend to be utilized primarily in shopping centers and similar types of suburban development as opposed to development of large office buildings, and we believe that the demand for suburban development should be stable to growing over the short to medium term. The supply of non-residential construction projects is also affected by the availability and cost of funding. 
Our Products
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
    We manufacture drainage pipe and precast products in the United States and Eastern Canada and concrete pressure pipe products in Eastern Canada. Drainage pipe has residential, non-residential and infrastructure applications. It is primarily used for storm water applications, such as storm drains for roads and highways, and for residential and non-residential site developments. In addition, drainage pipe is used for sanitary sewers, low-pressure sewer force mains, tunneled systems, treatment plant piping and utility tunnels. Drainage pipe consists of concrete reinforced by a steel cage. It is manufactured by producing a steel mesh cage, enclosing it in a form or mold and then pouring concrete around it to produce the pipe. Drainage pipe is manufactured in round, elliptical and arch shapes ranging from 12 inches to 144 inches in diameter and in box sizes ranging from three feet to 20 feet in length and width. 
    We also manufacture a wide variety of precast concrete products, including box culverts, utility vaults, manholes, drainage inlets and pipe end sections. These precast concrete products are used for applications such as roadway drainage, airport drainage, storm water management, utility construction and water treatment and filtration systems. Our range of precast concrete products also includes products that fall under the general description of specialty precast, including products for which we hold patents that make us the exclusive manufacturer, or which are manufactured under license agreements with third parties. These specialty products include architectural panels for buildings, modular railroad crossings, retaining wall systems, highway noise 
barriers, storm water treatment systems and concrete vaults, which are used to house either dry utilities (such as electrical, data or communications equipment) or wet utilities (such as valves, pumps or water meters).
    We also manufacture structural precast products in the United States and a range of precast concrete bridge girders for highway projects in both the United States and Eastern Canada. We manufacture a variety of structural precast products primarily for infrastructure and non-residential applications, including hollow-core planks, prestressed bridge girders, beams, columns, wall panels, stairs, garage floors and architectural cladding. These products are used as structural and architectural elements in building structures such as parking garages and arched and modular bridges.
    Precast concrete products are reinforced with steel, similar to pipe, and manufactured using either a dry cast or wet cast concrete mix, depending on the size of the piece and the number of identical pieces to be manufactured. In the dry cast method, a concrete mix with low water content, known as zero-slump concrete, is poured into a mold and then densely compacted around the steel reinforcement using a variety of manufacturing methods. The concrete structure is immediately removed from the mold and allowed to cure in a high humidity environment to ensure proper hydration of the concrete. This method allows multiple pieces to be produced from the same mold each day and is most suitable for high volume, repetitive manufacturing. In the wet cast method, a concrete mix with relatively high water content is poured into a mold and allowed to cure in the mold, which can take from four to 16 hours. Precast concrete products typically range in diameter from four to 12 feet for round products or in length and width from one foot to 12 feet for square or rectangular products.
    We also regularly consider ways to innovate internally and expand our drainage pipe and precast product offerings by working to bring other products to market. Some of our product offerings include precast Duct Bank, Kenner Chainwall, and a number of storm water innovative technologies for storm water management marketed through our Bio Clean subsidiary. Duct Bank is a precast product that consolidates and protects underground electrical and communication cables and can be used in the construction of large buildings, including in data centers, as well as installing cabling underneath roads and areas with existing structures. Kenner Chainwall is a precast concrete foundation that provides a structurally sound, on-grade or elevated foundation to support prefabricated shelters or equipment buildings. One use is to elevate electrical equipment in flood zones such as those devastated by hurricanes. Each of these products is now commercially available. 
In addition, for larger diameter applications, we manufacture concrete pressure pipe, prestressed concrete pipe and bar-wrapped concrete pipe in Eastern Canada. Our concrete pressure pipe is used for water transmission and distribution, power plant cooling water lines, sewage force mains for wastewater and storm water and other diverse applications involving the movement of large volumes of water. Concrete-lined pressure pipe ranges from fourteen to 144 inches in diameter. Prestressed concrete pipe consists of a concrete core, a steel cylinder and a high tensile strength wire that is wrapped, under measured tension and at uniform spacing, around the steel cylinder. This wire wrap places the steel cylinder and concrete core in compression, developing the pipe’s ability to withstand specified hydrostatic pressures and external loads. An outside coating of mortar protects the wires. Bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe combines the physical strength of steel with the structural and protective properties of high strength cement mortar. In this type of pipe, a round steel bar is helically wound around a welded steel cylinder and all surfaces are encased in cement mortar. This composite pipe reacts as a unit when resisting internal pressure and external loads. The inside of the cylinder is lined with centrifugally cast cement mortar.    Our concrete pressure pipe is highly engineered and is built to order for technically demanding applications requiring various thresholds of working pressure, surge pressure and loads. Our engineers work closely with customers to design components and systems to meet specific regulatory and industrial demands. 
    In addition to our operations, we have a 50% equity interest in Concrete Pipe & Precast LLC, or CP&P, a joint venture with Eagle Corporation. CP&P operates 12 plants that serve the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. CP&P manufactures drainage pipe and precast concrete products and sells those products to similar types of customers as the ones to which we market. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding CP&P. In November 2021 we entered into an agreement to sell our 50% equity interest in CP&P to Eagle, with the closing of this transaction subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the consummation of the Merger and approval by the DOJ.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
    Utilizing the U.S. Pipe brand, we manufacture a number of products used for the transmission of potable water and wastewater in pipe diameters ranging from three to 64 inches.
    We manufacture DIP in pipe diameters ranging from three to 64 inches in the United States. For each diameter of pipe, we offer a wide range of thicknesses with both standard and specialized linings and coatings. DIP is used for transmission and distribution of potable water and wastewater. DIP has residential and infrastructure repair replacement applications, including potable water distribution systems, small water system grids, major water transmission mains, wastewater collection systems, sewer force mains and water treatment plants. In addition to DIP, we also manufacture a full line of complementary joint restraints and fittings in Mexico, which are utilized for interlocking adjoining segments of pipe and are typically bundled with DIP. We also operate fabrication plants that modify our pipe to meet specific customer design requirements for above-ground applications.
    DIP is manufactured using a process that consists of introducing molten iron into a rapidly-rotating steel mold and relying on centrifugal force to distribute the molten iron evenly around the inner surface of the mold to produce pipe of uniform size and dimensions. We also strive to innovate in our Water Pipe & Products segment, including by offering metallic zinc coating and TR-XTREME pipe. Metallic zinc coating is active corrosion protection for DIP. TR-XTREME pipe is DIP designed for areas of seismic activity and has joints that provide flexible extension capabilities.
Customers and Markets
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
    We typically sell our drainage pipe and precast products to contractors that perform construction work for various levels of government, residential and non-residential building owners, and developers in markets across the United States and Eastern Canada. Additionally, although they are not our direct customers, we view the owners and engineers who are customers of the contractors that purchase our products as our customers as well, because these owners and engineers often specify the types of products that our customers are required to use. We also sell our drainage pipe and precast products to utility companies. Several of our largest manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to our markets. Our drainage pipe and precast products are typically shipped within a radius of 150 miles, but in some cases up to 350 miles, from our manufacturing facilities. Our concrete pressure pipe is used in projects for regional water authorities and districts, cities, counties, municipalities, port authorities, private companies and industrial clients, including power plants, and is typically shipped within a radius of 500 miles from our manufacturing facility.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
    Our water transmission pipe products are sold to some of the largest waterworks distributors and contractors. Our Water Pipe & Products segment has significant sales through distributors, including Core & Main, a key customer that accounted for 18% and 16% of our consolidated net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also sell to utility contractors that work on new or replacement pipeline projects, primarily in the East, South and Midwest of the United States. DIP is typically shipped within a radius of 1,000 miles.
Competition
Drainage Pipe & Products Segment
    Our competitors in our Drainage Pipe & Products Segment include Rinker Materials (a division of the QUIKRETE Companies) and Oldcastle Infrastructure (a unit of CRH plc), as well as numerous regional and local manufacturers servicing various geographies. Additionally, our drainage pipe products compete with high density polyethylene, or HDPE, and polypropylene pipe products where such materials would serve as an appropriate substitute for our product.
Within Canada, our concrete pressure pipe products compete with DECAST (formerly Munro Concrete Products, Ltd.) and several other American and Canadian competitors. Our concrete-lined pressure pipe also competes with pressure pipe made from other materials such as fiberglass, HDPE and PVC.
Water Pipe & Products Segment
    Our two largest competitors in DIP manufacturing are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. Our DIP products also compete with polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, and HDPE pipe and, when pricing achieves certain levels, we may also compete with foreign manufacturers of DIP. Our national network of fabrication products competes with regional and local providers of those products and services.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
    Our products are generally made to order, but certain of our Drainage concrete pipe and DIP products are made to inventory. We have established target levels of inventory for certain products that we attempt to keep available at our manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand. Inventories are held at manufacturing facilities and, to a lesser extent, at distribution yards.
    Our structural precast products, most precast concrete products and concrete pressure pipe are customized products that are made to order. Our order backlog for precast concrete products is typically two to six months. Our order backlog for concrete pressure pipe and other precast offerings (bridge products) is approximately three to eighteen months depending on the demand in the geographic area for specific products.
    We seek to attract and retain customers through customer service and technical expertise, as well as product quality, our product and service offerings and competitive pricing. Our market strategy for products with non-residential end users is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships rather than traditional advertising.
    We maintain in-house technical sales, engineering and field service teams which provide customers technical expertise and support to assist them in finding the right product or solution for their specific need. Each of our operating segments has its own sales force. Overall, we employ approximately 275 sales and related support professionals. Our sales force and customer service functions are staffed by experienced professionals who have been trained in our product lines, processes and systems, and who maintain touch points with engineers, contractors, builders, and distributors. Additionally, we have a staff of more than 150 engineers that we employ to work in concert with our sales force to help develop effective product solutions for our customers. 
    We sell our DIP products and our fittings and fabricated products primarily through distributors. Our drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and precast concrete products are mostly sold direct to customers who are installing such products for or are the end users of such products. Drainage pipe, concrete pressure pipe, and certain precast products are sold through a bidding process in which we seek to place the most competitive bid. We undertake marketing efforts through our participation in trade shows and through our website. We outsource many of our product deliveries by using a combination of dedicated carriers and other third-party carriers.
Raw Materials and Inputs
    The primary material for our drainage pipe and precast concrete products and our concrete pressure pipe is concrete, which consists of water, cement and aggregates. Another key input for our products is steel, which is used to provide reinforcement within our drainage pipe and precast concrete products. Our DIP is largely made from iron melted from recycled scrap metals. Other key materials for our DIP include foundry coke and certain additives, such as alloys.
    Most of our raw materials are widely available commodities. While we have experienced challenges in obtaining certain materials during 2021 as a result of a globally challenged supply chain environment, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials. To the extent we do not produce any raw materials, 
when and where possible, we try to purchase raw materials from the source, and because of their low value-to-weight ratios, we generally try to source our raw materials in the vicinity of our facilities. We usually purchase the raw materials we need in the spot market, except where we anticipate a significant need of materials for a specific project. Other than certain contracts for key materials, including cement and steel, we typically do not enter into long-term supply contracts with our suppliers that require us to purchase particular quantities or to pay particular prices. 
    We purchase our steel from a number of different suppliers, but most suppliers are based in the United States in order to comply with “Buy America” government contract requirements placed on our customers. We endeavor to purchase these steel supplies from the entity which is as close as possible to the manufacturer.
    To manufacture DIP, fabricated products and fittings, we purchase scrap metal directly from qualified scrap sources near our foundry sites in the United States and Mexico. We utilize certain categories of scrap metal, primarily shredded automobile bodies, plate & structural, and cast iron. We purchase foundry coke from two merchant coke producers in the United States, both located in Birmingham, Alabama. Major alloys and additives are procured from both domestic and foreign sources based on a semiannual bid process.
Seasonality
    The construction industry, and therefore demand for our products, is typically seasonal and dependent on weather conditions, with periods of snow or heavy rain negatively affecting construction activity. For a more detailed discussion, see the sections titled Item 1A., Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a discussion of the seasonality of our business.
Team Members 
    As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,824 team members, 1,434 of which were salaried and 3,390 of which were hourly. Of the total number of team members, 4,272 were located in the United States, 277 were located in Canada and 275 were located in Mexico. The number of hourly workers we employ varies to match our labor needs during periods of fluctuating demand and varies seasonally in certain regions. We also contract to hire temporary workers as needed to meet production goals.
    As of December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 46% of these team members are included in collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year of December 31, 2021. We have not had any recent union-organized work stoppages in the United States, Canada or Mexico. We believe that we have good relationships with our team members and with the unions representing our team members.
Health and Safety
    We believe there is nothing more important than the health, safety and wellness of our team members; we believe this commitment is both a moral imperative and is fundamental to driving success in our business. We are committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for our team members and are constantly looking for ways to improve our facilities and processes in order to better serve these goals. We also provide team members and their families with access to programs that promote their health and wellness, including wellness and disease prevention programs, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous policies and initiatives to assure that our team members, many of whom were essential infrastructure workers, could operate in an environment that promoted each individual’s health and safety, to provide paid leave and other benefits to employees directly impacted by the pandemic, and to allow those team members whose roles enabled them to work from home to do so. We have continued many of these policies and initiatives and are continuing to evaluate the need for such policies in the future.
Compensation and Benefits 
    In order to attract, retain, and engage our team members to drive our success, we provide compelling compensation and benefit programs that are competitive in our markets. Our programs include a combination of some or all of the following: competitive market-based pay, bonuses, stock awards, defined contribution retirement plans with Company matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, wellness programs, company-paid life insurance, paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, flexibility to allow work from home in certain situations including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reimbursement for some health and fitness programs, and many others. These benefits can vary in our Canada and Mexico locations based on local availability and regulations. We are committed to ensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.
Talent Development
    We know that our continued success depends on our ability to engage with our team members and grow them into the future leaders our business needs. To that end, we have implemented robust learning management tools and training programs focused on developing our team members. Recent areas of focus have included implementation of a comprehensive program to develop skills for our sales professionals as well as development of a front-line leader training system for our plant-level supervisors. In addition, we periodically conduct a survey of our team members to determine where they are engaged and where we can improve.
Diversity and Inclusion
    One of our core values is respect for people, and that includes providing a workplace that is committed to valuing diversity and inclusion of people of all backgrounds, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, religious belief, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or cultural background. As of December 31, 2021, underrepresented minorities (defined as those individuals who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 49.43% of our team members, and women represented approximately 9.7% of our workforce.
Intellectual Property
    We own various United States and foreign patents, registered trademarks, trade names and trade secrets and applications for, or licenses in respect of, the same, that relate to our various business lines including a number of innovative technologies relating to storm water management. The U.S. Pipe name has been a recognized manufacturer of DIP for more than 115 years. We also license intellectual property for use in certain of our products from unaffiliated third parties. We believe that our patents, trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are adequately protected and that any expiration or other loss of one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
    We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations governing health and safety or the protection of the environment and natural resources, including, for example:
•the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the generation, handling, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of waste from our operations;
•the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws that govern the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations which we have sent waste for disposal;
•the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws and regulations that can impose detailed permit requirements and strict controls on discharges of waste water from our facilities; and
•the federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions, including federal and state laws and regulations to address greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions.
    Environmental pre-construction and operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. It is likely that we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws, as well as laws enacted to reduce climate change. It is also likely that we will be required to make additional expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters such as pollution controls and carbon emissions, on an ongoing basis. As our operations involve, and have involved, the handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as, toxic or hazardous or otherwise as pollutants, there is some risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the materials and products we handle and transport. Consequently, we are subject to environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances. We are also subject to a variety of health and safety laws and regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Manufacturing sites can be inherently dangerous workplaces. Our sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials and there is inherent risk of related liabilities in our operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
    We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted, and new laws that we anticipate will be adopted that could affect our operations. For health and safety regulations, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, sets minimum standards; we have adopted programs internally that are intended to meet or exceed these requirements. 
    Despite our compliance efforts, risk of environmental, health and safety liability is inherent in the operation of our business, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and there can be no assurance that environmental, health and safety liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.
    Our consolidated financial statements include estimated liabilities for future costs arising from environmental issues relating to our properties and operations. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued environmental liabilities of approximately $1.3 million. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
    We have been named as a potentially responsible party, or PRP, at sites identified by the EPA or state regulatory agencies for investigation and remediation under CERCLA, or comparable state statutes, generally referred to as Superfund sites, including Sylacauga, AL, North Birmingham, AL, Portland, OR and Chattanooga, TN. With respect to these Superfund sites for which we have received PRP notices, we are entitled to contractual indemnity from a third party, subject to the terms of the indemnity provisions contained in the relevant agreement. Our estimates of current liabilities factor in these indemnification rights and our assessment of the likelihood that the indemnitor will fulfill its obligations with respect to liabilities relating to such sites. To date, the indemnifying party has been fulfilling its indemnification obligation with respect to those Superfund sites, and we have no reason to believe it will not continue to do so. However, in the future, we can provide no assurance that the indemnifying party will continue to honor its obligations, or that the existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover the liabilities for such matters.
