Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 JFrogs vision is to power a world of continuously updated, version-less softwarewe call this Liquid Software. 
 We provide an end-to-end, hybrid, universal DevOps Platform to achieve Continuous Software Release Management, or CSRM. Our leading CSRM platform enables organizations to continuously deliver software updates across any system. Our platform is the critical bridge between software development and deployment of that software, paving the way for the modern DevOps paradigm. We enable organizations to build and release software faster and more securely while empowering developers to be more efficient. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 6,050 organizations have adopted JFrog, embarking on their journey towards Liquid Software. 
 Digital transformation has become an imperative for all organizations, and as such, organizations of all types and sizes are increasingly dependent upon software to better engage with their customers, partners, and employees. As a result, the continuous and reliable release of new software has become mission critical. An organizations failure to keep software current or react to problems with timely software updates can not only cost lost revenue and reputation, but also threaten human safety and lives. The increased pace and volume of new software and updates have made releasing software in monolithic, discrete versions (e.g., v1.0, v2.0, v3.0) too slow to adequately address dynamic customer demands. We believe the end state of digital transformation is a non-stop, always-on, secure, continuous delivery of value to users, enabled by a world of version-less software. 
 DevOps enables the software innovation that is driving digital transformation. The need for organizations to better serve their customers, partners, and employees through software is driving the demand for constant innovation of the software build and release workflow. As the pace and variety of software creation have increased, the domains of software developers and IT operators have converged. Since our inception, we have embraced the culture and methodologies of modern software development and delivered a platform that connects developers and operators, thus providing the foundation for DevOps. DevOps has since become the approach modern digital organizations take to software development and operations, shortening, automating, and improving the software build and release workflow. 
 While many software development technologies today address aspects of a particular segment of DevOps, CSRM, enabled by JFrog, provides the common ground for software developers and IT operators, making it integral to the DevOps workflow. Software as it is written by a developer, in source code, cannot be deployed in a runtime environment. In order for software to run in production, source code is transformed into executable binary files that can be understood by and run on a server or device. Organizations need tools that can turn source code into binary files, store and manage these binaries, and then create software packages, or combinations of one or more binary files, that can be released and deployed to runtime environments. Our platform is designed to manage and deploy all types of software packages within an organization, making it the system of record for an organizations software, and is often called the database of DevOps. 
 We had $598.1 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. We generated revenue of $150.8 million and $104.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a growth rate of 44%. Our net loss was $9.4 million and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated operating cash flow of $29.5 million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our free cash flow was $25.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Software and the Business Environment 
 The volume and importance of software is exploding. Organizations in all industries and of all sizes have turned to software to facilitate interactions with their customers, manage day-to-day operations, gain actionable

  business insights, secure their digital environments, and drive digital transformation. As a result, softwares role has changed from a functional tool to a cornerstone of our daily lives, and from a simple means of driving insight and efficiency to a significant source of competitive advantage. 
 The continuous and reliable release of new software is therefore mission critical, where delay or failure can be disruptive to our daily lives and costly to business. If drivers and riders are not running the same version of a ride-hailing companys software and fail to connect, even for the briefest of moments, those riders can easily turn to a competitor. If an out-of-date piece of a financial institutions software stack allows a security breach, the organization can suffer enormous reputational harm and be liable for damages. If an airplanes software is not current, passengers lives may be put in danger. 
 In order to address growing customer expectations, organizations have dramatically reduced the time between releasing new features and functions and resolving security vulnerabilities, from years to months or even days. Updating a feature of a software application, rather than releasing a new version of the entire application, ensures that current software is brought to market faster, allowing organizations to be more responsive to their customers needs, and makes software updates less disruptive to the user experience. To keep software current in todays environment, software updates need to be released incrementally, and with increased frequency. 
 The proliferation of open source software, availability of newer and more efficient software development technologies, and the increasing interconnectedness of software enable organizations to produce software at an increasing rate. Meanwhile, the adoption of new architectures, platforms, and technologies, such as microservices, containers, and hybrid and multi-cloud environments, creates significant complications in managing the software release cycle. Organizations existing approaches to their software release cycles address each step of the cycle separately, creating silos and bottlenecks around critical steps, such as building, testing, securing, and delivering software. The combination of these new technologies and legacy approaches has placed significant strain on the traditional software build and release workflow. 
 The DevOps Workflow 
 DevOps enables the software innovation that is driving digital transformation. As the domains of software developers and IT operators have converged. DevOps has emerged as a discipline that integrates software development and operations, shortening, automating, and improving the software build and release workflow. DevOps is a combination of new technologies, methodologies, and culture that powers a continuous, fast, and secure software release cycle. 
 The DevOps workflow spans the lifecycle of software, from the planning, coding, building, and testing of software by developers, to the releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring of that software by operators. DevOps increasingly includes the process of managing security earlier in the software release cycle, known as DevSecOps, which helps to remove silos and bottlenecks. While many software development technologies today address aspects of a particular segment of DevOps, CSRM, enabled by JFrog, provides the common ground for software developers and IT operators, making it integral to the DevOps workflow. 
 CSRM and the Importance of Packages 
 Organizations need for a continuous, fast, and secure software release cycle has particularly elevated the importance of the core DevOps workflow: building, testing, releasing, and deploying software. This bridge, spanning from the development side to the operations side, is mission critical, yet exceedingly difficult to build and manage at the scale and speed that organizations require. We refer to this key portion of the DevOps workflow as CSRM. 
 Software as it is written by a developer, in source code, cannot be deployed in a runtime environment. In order for software to run in production, source code is transformed into executable binary files that can be

  understood by and run on a server or device. Organizations need tools that can turn source code into binary files, store and manage these binaries, and then create software packages, or combinations of one or more binary files, that can be released and deployed to runtime environments. Our platform is designed to manage and deploy all types of software packages within an organization, making it the system of record for an organizations software. 
 In todays business environment the volume and variety of packages that need to be managed and stored by organizations are rapidly increasing. Packages are increasingly created by both humans and machines as software build and release workflows are automated, and can also be imported from external sources, such as open source libraries and repositories. The increasingly large volumes and complexity of packages within organizations software development ecosystems require a new, systematic, and automated approach to the management of packages. Code repositories, which store and manage source code, are helpful and important developer tools, but cannot efficiently take software that was written by developers and deploy it in runtime environments because they are not purpose-built to manage and cache binary files. Tracking and managing software at the package level enables organizations to make incremental updates to software, eliminating the need for software versions. Package management allows software release management to be continuous, and capable of handling the volume, variety, and velocity of software required today. 
 Our Platform 
 We built the worlds first universal package repository, JFrog Artifactory, to fundamentally transform the way that the software release cycle is managed. Our package-based approach to releasing software enabled the category of CSRM, allowing software releases to be continuous and software to always be current. 
 We enable organizations to store all package types in a common repository where they can be edited, tracked, and managed. Our unified platform connects all of the software release processes involved in building and releasing software, enabling CSRM. We empower our customers to shorten their software release cycles and enable the continuous flow of current, up-to-date software from any source to any destination. Our platform is designed to be agnostic to the programming languages, source code repositories, and development technologies that our customers use, and the type of production environments to which they deploy. 
 Our fully integrated suite of products allows our customers to compile software from source code repositories, manage the dependencies among components within software packages, move packages to a universal repository, ingest packages from third parties, including open source libraries, scan for vulnerabilities through various stages, distribute to endpoints, and deploy in production, all through a single user access point. 
 Since our initial launch of JFrog Artifactory, we have consistently innovated and added new products to expand the capabilities of our platform. Today, our platform comprises the full workflow for releasing software.

All references to our customers included in this Annual Report refer to paying customers. 
Technology 
 Our proprietary technology, fueled by our optimized database architecture, enables best-in-class reliability, scalability, and performance. 
 Our technology includes the following key attributes: 
 

 | Universal package management. The core of our platform, JFrog Artifactory, stores packages and manages the metadata from the major package technologies, including Debian, Docker, Go, Helm, Kubernetes, Maven, NPM, NuGet, Python, and RPM, in a manner similar to a relational database, wherein it can manage package versions, organize and track dependencies, and perform replication across geographically distributed repositories. Our platform is designed to quickly and seamlessly add support for new package technologies as they arise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Localizing public repositories. JFrog Artifactory automatically queries third-party repositories, and allows organizations to exert choice and governance in the packages they cache. We help customers minimize dependency on the availability and reliability of online resources by allowing them to control packages within the confines of their organizations, enabling them to better maintain control and security via the blacklisting or whitelisting of certain components.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rich metadata. Every package in JFrog Artifactory is stored and referenced using metadata, including dependencies, author, and date modified. We utilize our proprietary technology to store and index
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 


 
metadata, allowing it to be queried for multiple uses such as package promotion, tagging, security, and more, which enables automation. This metadata can be generated from many sources, such as users, third-parties, and packages themselves.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Checksum-based storage. A checksum is a sequence of numbers and letters that serves as a digital fingerprint. Each package has a unique checksum that is stored as a file and referenced by JFrog Artifactory. When it is necessary to replicate or copy files, JFrog Artifactorys proprietary checksum-based storage optimizes the process by de-duplicating the storage process and directly creating new references to the existing checksum file. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data needed within JFrog Artifactory or when copying packages to remote sites or replicating repositories, making it substantially faster than traditional approaches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | High Availability. Our High Availability configuration allows multiple JFrog product nodes to be deployed as a redundant cluster to reduce reliance on any single node. Our products support a High Availability configuration with a cluster of two or more active/active nodes, ensuring that there can be no single-point-of-failure. If any specific node goes down, a system will continue to operate through the remaining, redundant nodes with little to no downtime or degradation of performance of the system as a whole. Further, the High Availability configuration means that our products can accommodate larger load bursts with horizontal server scalability, so that organizations can meet increasing load requirements. Importantly, our High Availability configuration allows customers to update our products with the latest versions with little to no downtime, as each node is updated one at a time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Hierarchical graph of software packages. By tracking against a database of known vulnerabilities, our platform provides continuous security and analysis of packages in the development environment. We provide continuous protection by recursively scanning components down to their binary file levels on a regular basis. Integration with major package technologies allows us to provide critical insights early in the development phase, making it less likely for vulnerable components to reach production.

 | Enterprise-class security and compliance. Organizations can use our platform to help manage the integrity of software being deployed by digitally signing packages and binary files. Groups, API tokens, users, and other characteristics can all be managed from various points within multiple data centers, alongside real-time access replication. We define access policies at the full repository or single package level consistent with industry practice and widely accepted protocols.

 | Easy user plugins. User plugins allow customers to extend the functionality of our products. For virtually any action performed in a development environment, customers can write a user plugin that effectively extends the JFrog Artifactory REST API, providing a simple way to add functionality, including scheduling tasks, managing security and authentication, license compliance, open source governance, package resolution and deployment, build integration, promotion logic, maintenance, and clean up. Additionally, our open source plugins can be changed, debugged, and redeployed by users in near real-time.

Marketing and Sales 
 Marketing 
 We have a bottom-up, community-focused approach to marketing that prioritizes increasing the effectiveness of software developers and IT operators. We empower software developers and IT operators to release software faster and more securely, and in the process create champions of our products who naturally demonstrate the value of JFrog to their broader organizations. These communities can easily engage with our products through free trials, freemium offerings, and open source software before deciding to use them on a paid basis. We believe this approach gives us a competitive advantage, as software developer and IT operator communities have become integral in spreading awareness of our brand, expanding use cases, and overall organizational adoption of our platform. As a result, the value we bring to software developers and IT operators organically drives demand, as increased awareness, knowledge sharing, and adoption leads to greater exposure to the other features and products in our user interface.

 Recently, we introduced field marketing to support our strategic sales team to provide an account-based approach to drive expansion on JFrog within our largest customers. Additionally, we engage with prospective customers through user-centered events, including swampUP, our annual user conference, hands-on training events, and co-marketing activities with technology partners and large cloud platforms. 
 Sales 
 We employ a self-service and inbound sales model, which makes it easy for customers to try, adopt, and use our products, creating a highly efficient sales motion. Our customers can start with an open source version of JFrog Artifactory, freemium product offerings, or free trial subscription options, or land directly with one of our paid subscription tiers. Our open source, freemium, and free trial options provide low-friction entry points for customers, who often upgrade to paid and higher-tiered subscriptions as they increase their usage of our products through the identification of new use cases, the need for additional functionality, or the adoption of our products by new teams or in new geographies. Once a user has decided to use our products beyond what is available in open source or freemium versions, or at the end of a free trial, they can upgrade to one of our paid subscriptions, which are priced based on number of servers or usage to align the value we deliver with our customers needs as they scale. 
 Our customer success teams are focused on enabling organizations to realize the full benefits of our platform by helping them advance their CSRM practices and promoting the adoption of additional products and more advanced functionality of our platform. To date, we have not deployed a significant outbound sales force, relying primarily on our self-service and inbound sales model. Recently, we have begun building a high-touch strategic sales team to identify new use cases and drive expansion and standardization on JFrog within our largest customers. 
 Competition 
 The worldwide DevOps market is rapidly evolving. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including: 
 

 | ability to provide an end-to-end, unified platform for the CSRM workflow;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | breadth of technologies we support;
--+------------------------------------


 | breadth of technology integrations;
--+------------------------------------


 | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


 | extensibility across organizations, including software developers, IT operators, and IT managers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to enable collaboration between software developers and IT operators;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to deploy our products in any combination of cloud, multi-cloud or on-premise environments;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance, security, scalability, and reliability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | quality of customer experience and satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | quality of customer support;
--+-----------------------------


 | ease of implementation and use; and
--+------------------------------------


 | brand recognition and reputation.
--+----------------------------------

 Our products are available for both self-managed and SaaS deployments. While we believe we compete successfully on the above factors, particularly with regards to the comprehensive nature of our solutions, we do experience competition in each of these categories with different vendors: 
 

 | With respect to self-managed deployments, diversified software companies, such as IBM, Inc. (Red Hat), Pivotal Software, Inc., and VMware, Inc., and developer-focused software companies, such as GitLab Inc. and Sonatype, Inc., have offerings that compete with certain of our products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14 


 
 | With respect to SaaS deployments, cloud providers, such as Alphabet Inc. (GCP), Amazon.com, Inc. (AWS), and Microsoft Corporation (Azure DevOps including GitHub), have offerings that compete with certain of our products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, we compete with home-grown, start-up, and open source technologies across the categories described above. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies, features, and integrations of our platform, as well as the continued improvement and iteration of our existing products. Our most significant investments in research and development are to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. Research and development employees are located primarily in our Israel and India offices. 
 Our research and development team consists of our architects, software engineers, security experts, DevOps engineers, product management, quality assurance, and data collection teams. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform and products. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements, license agreements, invention assignment agreements, trademarks, and patents to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 12 U.S. patent applications including one pending U.S. provisional patents. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any of our patents issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. 
 Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
 We control access to, and use of, our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of

  authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled Risk Factors for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
 Government Regulations 
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations. For example, we are subject to numerous laws, directives, and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other data. In addition, in some cases, our software is subject to export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to certain trade and economic sanctions. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business in Israel, the United States and internationally could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Employees and Human Capital 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. In addition to competitive base salaries and cash compensation, the principal purposes of our share incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of share-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. In addition to traditional employee benefits, we have implemented a number of innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employee base. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of approximately 700 employees operating across six countries, including approximately 350 employees located in Israel and approximately 230 employees located in the United States. We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural background or religious belief and we strive to emphasize this equality as part of our core values to provide our employees a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or, except for certain of our employees in France and Spain, covered by collective bargaining agreements.
