Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), a Delaware corporation, has an established history of discovering and developing innovative therapeutics derived from its unique platform of antibody technologies. We typically have sought to license these therapeutic assets to our licensees who take on the responsibilities of later stage development, approval and commercialization. In addition, we have licensed our antibody technologies on a non-exclusive basis to other companies who desire to access this platform for their own discovery efforts.
 We are evolving our strategy to be focused on developing or acquiring revenue-generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate infrastructure. Our goal is to create a sustainably profitable business and generate meaningful value for our stockholders. Since our business model is based on the goal of out-licensing to other pharmaceutical companies for them to commercialize and market any resultant products, we expect a significant portion of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive from our licensees.
 We have a portfolio of product candidates, programs, and technologies that are the subject of licenses we have in place with pharmaceutical and biotech companies including Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (“Novartis”), Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (“Takeda”), Johnson & Johnson, Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. (“Five Prime”), and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. There are over 20 such programs that are funded by other companies and could produce milestone payments and royalty payments in the future.

Our asset base includes antibodies with unique properties including several that interact at allosteric sites on a specific protein rather than the orthosteric, or active, sites. These compounds are designed to either enhance or diminish the target protein’s activity as desired. We believe allosteric-modulating antibodies may be more selective or offer a safety advantage in certain disease indications when compared to more traditional modes of action.
 In February 2017, we achieved initial proof-of-concept (“POC”) with our first-in-class X358 clinical program for patients with hypoglycemia due to congenital hyperinsulinism (“CHI”) and patients with hypoglycemia post bariatric surgery (“PBS”). These two indications are rare conditions with very few therapeutic options. Consistent with the strategy outlined above, it is our intention to maximize the value of X358 for shareholders through a licensing agreement, either now or after continued investment to increase its value to a prospective partner. We believe this approach will expedite potential patient access for those in need of new treatment options in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.
 Organization
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and became a Bermuda-exempted company in December 1998. Effective December 31, 2011, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Delaware and changed our name from XOMA Ltd. to XOMA Corporation. When referring to a time or period before December 31, 1998 or after December 31, 2011, the terms “Company” and “XOMA” refer to XOMA Corporation, a Delaware corporation; when referring to a time or period between December 31, 1998 and December 31, 2011, such terms refer to XOMA Ltd., a Bermuda company.
 Our principal executive offices are located at 2910 Seventh Street, Berkeley, California 94710, and we maintain a registered office located at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801. Our telephone number at our principal executive offices is (510) 204-7200. Our website address is www.xoma.com.
 Business Strategy 
 We have traditionally specialized in the discovery and development of innovative antibody-based therapeutics. In 2016, we dedicated our research and development efforts to advancing our portfolio of product candidates that have the potential to treat a variety of endocrine diseases, including advancing the development of X358 in CHI and PBS studies. We have recently refined our business strategy to prioritize out-licensing of our internally developed product candidates while reducing further internal expenditures for research and development.
 Our business model is designed to create value for stockholders by assembling a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical revenue streams and operating that business with an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to become a sustainably profitable company that offers investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a diversified, lower-risk business investment than a typical biotech. Our business model is based on the concept of out-licensing product candidates that we have developed internally and partnering with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage their capabilities in the areas of late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization to ultimately generate revenue for our company. Our revenue currently consists mostly of license fees and milestones from our licensees. In addition to advancing our early-stage proprietary drug candidates, we intend to use an acquisition strategy to add new assets, pipelines, and technologies that we anticipate will generate additional revenue streams in future years.
 

Proprietary Product Candidates
 We have a portfolio of unique monoclonal antibodies and technologies that we intend to license to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further their clinical development. A summary of these product candidates is provided below:

• | X358 is a first-in-class fully human negative allosteric modulating insulin receptor antibody that was derived from our proprietary XMet platform. We are investigating this antibody as a novel treatment for non-drug-induced, endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (low blood glucose caused by excessive insulin produced by the body). There are two rare disease indications that may benefit from X358 that are of greatest interest to us: CHI, a hereditary disease resulting in lack of insulin regulation and profound hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia in hyperinsulinemic PBS patients. In June 2015, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation for X358 by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of CHI, and in June 2016, we received Orphan Drug Designation for X358 in the same indication from the European Union.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 X358 has successfully completed Phase 1 testing in healthy volunteers, which showed the antibody reduced insulin sensitivity and decreased glucose after exogenous insulin injection and it appeared to be well tolerated, with no serious adverse events observed. The results were presented at the Endocrine Society's Annual Meeting in March 2015.
 2


In October 2015, we initiated a single-dose Phase 2 POC study of X358 in patients with CHI and in April 2016, we initiated a single-dose Phase 2 POC study of X358 in PBS patients experiencing hypoglycemia after meals. In September 2016, we presented the initial data from nine patients who had enrolled in the CHI and PBS studies, together with safety data from 22 healthy volunteers. Shortly thereafter, we submitted a proposal to the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) to initiate a multi-dose Phase 2 clinical study of X358 in children two years and older diagnosed with CHI. The MHRA approved the protocol in principal, and the study is in now in review at local ethics committees. We anticipate the site to be ready for first dosing in the UK in the second quarter of 2017. Submissions of this study are underway in Germany, Denmark and Israel as well.
 In January 2017, we announced that we have established POC for X358 in CHI and hypoglycemia PBS. The CHI acute studies met their objectives of establishing initial safety and X358 POC in CHI patients aged 12 and up across several dosing levels. We are nearing the launch of a multi-dose study in children with CHI aged two and up that will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The PBS study has completed dosing in the single-dose cohorts and has also met its objectives. In February 2017, we initiated a multi-dose study in PBS.
 We believe a therapy that safely and effectively mitigates insulin-induced hypoglycemia has the potential to address a significant unmet therapeutic need for these rare medical conditions associated with hyperinsulinism.
  
• | X213 (formerly LFA 102) is a first-in-class allosteric inhibitor of prolactin action. It is a humanized IgG1-Kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the human prolactin receptor with high affinity at an allosteric site. The antibody has been shown to inhibit prolactin-mediated signaling, and it is potent and similarly active against several animal and human prolactin receptors. Prolactin is a protein that in normal post-partum females enables the production of milk. In some cases, including prolactinomas, which are benign tumors of the pituitary gland in both men and women, excess secretion can lead to various clinically significant abnormal signs and symptoms. We discovered X213 under our collaboration with Novartis AG (formerly Chiron Corporation), and we exercised our right to bring the product back into our portfolio to develop it for diseases of hyperprolactinemia. We have initiated a Phase 2A POC study in women who wish to suppress lactation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 X213 could be developed to treat hyperprolactinemia in prolactinomas, a condition of benign tumors on the pituitary gland that leads to sexual dysfunction, infertility, and osteoporosis. For ten percent of the 140,000 prolactinoma patients in the United States, existing therapies are poorly tolerated or not effective. It also could be developed for anti-psychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia, a side effect seen in patients treated with commonly used antipsychotics, antidepressants, and pain medications. These patients exhibit the same signs and symptoms as prolactinoma, and compliance with anti-psychotic therapies is poor. Currently available therapies to address these side effects can worsen psychosis.
  
• | X129 is a highly potent fragment of a monoclonal antibody (“Fab”) with negative allosteric modulation activity against the insulin receptor. In animal model testing, it appears to have a fast-onset of action and short half-life. Hypoglycemia is a serious medical condition in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and Type 1 diabetes mellitus (“T1 DM”) and can occur as a result of insulin therapy, accidental insulin overdose or treatment with sulfonylureas. Recurrent hypoglycemia leads to diminished recognition of the symptoms, which include palpitations, tremors, anxiety, sweating, and hunger. This reduced sensitivity to hypoglycemic symptoms can lead to more prolonged episodes and the advancement into acute severe hypoglycemia, which can result in confusion, loss of consciousness, and seizure. Acute severe hypoglycemia often presents during the nocturnal hours in patients who are treated aggressively for their T1 DM, which puts them at elevated risk for loss of consciousness and seizure. The medical community has long been challenged with how to prevent patients from experiencing nocturnal acute severe hypoglycemia, yet there have not been any significant breakthroughs in pharmaceutical development efforts or experiments in dietary practices.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have conducted preclinical testing for X129. In vitro assays showed X129 decreases the activity of insulin on mammalian cells over-expressing human, rat and minipig insulin receptor (“INSR”) in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies confirmed X129 binds to the INSR and acts as a negative allosteric modulator. In animal studies, potential rescue of insulin or sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycemia was modeled in normal rats. Administration of insulin or glibenclamide (a sulfonylurea) produced abnormally low glucose levels. Intravenous administration of X129 at time points wherein the drug-induced glucose levels were falling below normal levels rapidly stabilized blood glucose levels thereby preventing hypoglycemia. In normal minipigs, intramuscular administration normalized the hypoglycemia induced by Vetsulin (an intermediate acting pig insulin) with the effect lasting for several hours, thereby confirming the activity in mammals. When tested in a nocturnal hypoglycemia model in minipigs, subcutaneous administration of X129 successfully prevented blood glucose drop through the eight-hour duration of the study. The results from the rat studies were presented at the Endocrine Society's Annual Meeting in April 2016. The results from the minipig studies will be presented at the Endocrine Society's Annual Meeting in April 2017. We believe X129 could potentially offer clinicians a therapy that has rapid onset, improved efficacy and optimal duration of therapy to treat patients with acute severe hypoglycemia where currently available therapies are inadequate.

• | Gevokizumab is a potent humanized monoclonal antibody with unique allosteric properties that has the potential to treat patients with a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Gevokizumab binds strongly to interleukin 1 (“IL-1”) beta, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. By binding to IL-1 beta, gevokizumab modulates the activation of the IL-1 receptor, thereby preventing the cellular signaling events that produce inflammation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In December 2010, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Les Laboratories Servier (“Servier”) to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications. Under the terms of that collaboration agreement, Servier had worldwide rights to gevokizumab for cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications (cardiometabolic field) and rights outside the United States and Japan to all other indications. 
 On July 22, 2015, we announced the Phase 3 EYEGUARD-B study of gevokizumab in patients with Behçet’s disease uveitis did not meet the primary endpoint of time to first acute ocular exacerbation. Due to these results and belief they would be predictive of results in our other EYEGUARD studies of gevokizumab in patients with non-infectious uveitis (“NIU”), in August 2015 we decided to end the EYEGUARD global Phase 3 program prior to its planned completion. Servier and we closed down the EYEGUARD clinical sites and, as anticipated, neither EYEGUARD-A nor EYEGUARD-C produced positive results.
 In September 2015, Servier notified us of its intention to terminate the collaboration agreement, and return the worldwide gevokizumab rights to XOMA. The termination of the collaboration agreement became effective on March 25, 2016. 
 In March 2016, we closed our Phase 3 study of gevokizumab in pyoderma gangrenosum (“PG”). A preliminary review of the data from the study did not show a clear signal of activity in PG.
  
• | Additional Preclinical Product Candidates: In November 2016, we unveiled two novel oncology and oncology-related product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The first targets interleukin 2, (“IL-2”), which has long been recognized as an effective therapy for metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, but it has serious dose-limiting toxicities that prevent broad clinical use. We have generated novel antibodies that, when given with IL-2, are intended to steer IL-2 to enhance its positive impact with less toxicity, potentially improving the therapeutic index over standard IL-2 therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The other is an anti-parathyroid receptor (“PTH1R”) portfolio that includes several unique functional antibody antagonists targeting PTH1R, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the regulation of calcium metabolism. These antibodies have shown promising efficacy in in vivo studies and could potentially address unmet medical needs, including primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (“HHM”). HHM is present in many advanced cancers and is caused by high serum calcium due to increased levels of the PTH1R ligand PTH-related peptide (“PTHrP”). Current HHM treatments often fall short and many cancer patients die from ‘metabolic death'. XOMA’s PTH1R antibodies could be beneficial for the treatment of HHM.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Technologies Available for Non-Exclusive License
 We have a unique set of antibody discovery, optimization and development technologies available for licensing, including:
  
• | ADAPT™ (Antibody Discovery Advanced Platform Technologies): proprietary human antibody phage display libraries, integrated with yeast and mammalian display, which can be integrated into antibody discovery programs through license agreements. We believe access to ADAPT™ Integrated Display offers a number of benefits because it enables the diversity of phage libraries to be combined with accelerated discovery due to rapid immunoglobulin (“IgG”) reformatting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting based screening using yeast and mammalian display. This increases the probability of technical and business success in finding rare and unique functional antibodies directed to targets of interest.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ModulX™: technology which allows modulation of biological pathways using monoclonal antibodies and offers insights into regulation of signaling pathways, homeostatic control, and disease biology. Using ModulX™, XOMA has generated product candidates with novel mechanisms of action that specifically alter the kinetics of interaction between molecular constituents (e.g. receptor-ligand). ModulX™ technology enables expanded target and therapeutic options and offers a unique approach in the treatment of disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | OptimX™ technologies:
--+----------------------


o | Human Engineering™ (“HE™”): a proprietary humanization technology that allows modification of non-human monoclonal antibodies to reduce or eliminate detectable immunogenicity and make them suitable for medical purposes in humans. The technology uses a unique method developed by us, based on analysis of the conserved structure-function relationships among antibodies. The method defines which residues in a non-human variable region are candidates to be modified. The result is an HE™ antibody with preserved antigen binding, structure and function that has eliminated or greatly reduced immunogenicity. HE™ technology was used in development of gevokizumab and certain other antibody products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Targeted Affinity Enhancement™ (“TAE™”): a proprietary technology involving the assessment and guided substitution of amino acids in antibody variable regions, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity and selectivity. TAE™ generates a comprehensive map of the effects of amino acid mutations in the complementarity-determining region likely to impact binding. The technology has been licensed to a number of companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible Manufacturing: patented technology relating to a flexible arrangement of mobile clean rooms (“MCRs”) within a manufacturing facility, with each MCR providing a portable, self-contained environment that allows for drug development. The facility design allows MCRs to connect easily and quickly to a central supply of utilities such as air, water, and electricity. This unique arrangement facilitates flexible manufacturing and eliminates change-over downtime. This translates into significantly reduced capital expenditures, production costs, and maintenance costs while offering meaningful time advantages over conventional manufacturing facilities. When MCRs are not in use, they can be easily moved to cleaning/refurbishing areas and prepared MCRs can be "plugged in" for manufacturing. The flexible manufacturing system can be applied to fields as diverse as pharmaceuticals, biologics, and electronics.

Financial and Legal Arrangements of Product Collaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements
 Licensing and Collaboration Agreements
 Historically, we have licensed with or provided research and development collaboration services to world-class organizations, including Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Takeda in pursuit of new antibody products, and we expect that we will continue to capitalize on partnered product arrangements as opportunities arise. Below is a list of such license arrangements:
Novartis – Anti-TGFβ Antibody
 In September 2015, we and Novartis entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-TGF-β antibody program. Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. 
 Under the License Agreement, we received a $37.0 million upfront fee, and are eligible to receive up to a total of $480.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to up to a low double-digit percentage rate. Novartis’ obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. 
 Novartis – Anti-CD40 Antibody
 In September 2015, we and Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (“NVDI”), further amended our 2008 Amended and Restated Research, Development and Commercialization Agreement, relating to anti-CD40 antibodies. Under this agreement, NVDI is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program. The parties agreed to reduce the royalty rates that we are eligible to receive on sales of NVDI’s clinical stage anti-CD40 antibodies. These royalties are tiered based on sales levels and now range from a mid-single digit percentage rate to up to a low double-digit percentage rate.
 In 2013, we received a $7.0 million milestone relating to one currently active program. Our right to milestone payments expires at such time as no collaboration product or former collaboration product is being developed or commercialized anywhere in the world and no royalty payments on these products are due. Our right to royalty payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the launch of each product.

In connection with the collaboration between XOMA and Novartis AG (then Chiron Corporation), a secured note agreement was executed in May 2005. The note agreement is secured by our interest in the collaboration and was due and payable in full on June 21, 2015. On June 19, 2015, we and NVDI, who assumed the note agreement, agreed to extend the maturity date of our secured note agreement from June 21, 2015 to September 30, 2015, which was then subsequently extended to September 30, 2020. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance under this note agreement totaled $14.1 million and was included in our long-term portion of interest bearing obligations in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. Under the terms of the arrangement as restructured in November 2008, we will not make any additional borrowings on the Novartis note.
 Novo Nordisk
 In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Novo Nordisk under which we granted Novo Nordisk an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license to our XMetA program of allosteric monoclonal antibodies that positively modulate the insulin receptor (the “XMetA Program”), subject to our retained commercialization rights for rare disease indications. Novo Nordisk has an option to add these additional rights to its license upon payment of an option fee.
 Novo Nordisk is solely responsible for its expenses for the development and commercialization of antibodies and products containing antibodies arising from the XMetA Program, subject to our retained rights described above. We have transferred certain proprietary know-how and materials relating to the XMetA Program to Novo Nordisk. Under the agreement, we received a $5.0 million, non-creditable, non-refundable, upfront payment. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to $290.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered up to a high-single-digit percentage rate based on sales levels. Novo Nordisk’s obligation to pay development and commercialization milestones will continue for so long as Novo Nordisk is developing or selling products under the agreement, subject to the maximum milestone payment amounts set forth above. Novo Nordisk’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country.
 The agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novo Nordisk also has a unilateral right to terminate the agreement in its entirety on ninety (90) days’ notice.
 Servier – Gevokizumab
 In December 2010, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Servier obtained worldwide rights to cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications (cardiometabolic field) and rights outside the United States and Japan to all other indications, including NIU, Behçet’s disease uveitis and other inflammatory and oncology indications. We retained development and commercialization rights in the United States and Japan for all indications other than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
 In December 2010, we also entered into a loan agreement with Servier (the “Servier Loan Agreement”) that provided for an advance of up to €15.0 million. The loan was fully funded in January 2011, with the proceeds converting to approximately $19.5 million at the date of funding. The loan is secured by an interest in XOMA’s intellectual property rights to all gevokizumab indications worldwide, excluding certain rights in the United States and Japan. Interest is calculated at a floating rate based on a Euro Inter-Bank Offered Rate and is subject to a cap. The interest rate is reset semi-annually in January and July of each year. The interest rate for the initial interest period was 3.22% and was reset semi-annually ranging from 1.81% to 3.83%. Interest for the six-month period from mid-July 2016 through mid-January 2017 was reset to 1.81%. Interest is payable semi-annually and in January 2017, we paid $0.1 million in accrued interest to Servier.
 On January 9, 2015, Servier and we entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Loan Amendment”) to the Servier Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement was initially entered into on December 30, 2010 and subsequently amended by a Consent, Transfer, Assumption and Amendment Agreement entered into as of August 12, 2013, where the loan was transferred from XOMA Ireland Limited to XOMA (US) LLC. The Loan Amendment extended the maturity date of the loan from January 13, 2016 to three tranches of principal to be repaid as follows: €3.0 million on January 15, 2016, €5.0 million on January 15, 2017, and €7.0 million on January 15, 2018. In addition, the loan becomes immediately due and payable upon certain customary events of default. In January 2016, we paid the principal amount of €3.0 million. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding principal balance under this loan was $12.6 million using the December 31, 2016 Exchange Rate of 1.052. In January 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Servier Loan Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”). Amendment No. 3 extended the maturity date of the €5.0 million due on January 15, 2017 to July 15, 2017. The other terms of the loan remained unchanged.
 6


On September 28, 2015, Servier notified us of its intention to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, as amended, and return the gevokizumab rights to us. The termination became effective on March 25, 2016, and did not result in a change to the then maturity date of our loan with Servier. 
 Takeda
 In November 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda under which we agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda.
 Under the terms of this agreement, we may receive milestone payments aggregating up to $19.0 million relating to one undisclosed product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 13.5 years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.
 In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive milestones of up to $3.3 million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibody products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. 
 We have completed a technology transfer and do not expect to perform any further research and development services under this program. From 2011 through 2016, we received milestone payments totaling $2.3 million relating to one currently active program.
 Pfizer
 In August 2007, we entered into a license agreement (the “2007 Agreement”) with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) for non-exclusive, worldwide rights for our patented bacterial cell expression technology for research, development and manufacturing of antibody products. In December 2015, we entered into a settlement and amended license agreement with Pfizer, under which we granted Pfizer fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive license rights to our patented bacterial cell expression technology for phage display and other research, development and manufacturing of antibody products for cash payment by Pfizer of $3.8 million in full satisfaction of all obligations to us under the 2007 Agreement between XOMA (then XOMA Ireland Limited) and Pfizer Inc., including all potential milestone, royalty and other fees under the 2007 Agreement. As a result of the settlement with Pfizer, the 2007 Agreement was terminated. 
 In August 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Wyeth (subsequently acquired by Pfizer) for non-exclusive, worldwide rights for certain of our patented bacterial cell expression technology for vaccine manufacturing. In December 2016, we sold our rights to receive further royalties under this agreement for an upfront payment of $6.5 million and potential future payments of up to $4.0 million.
 Dyax
 In October 2006, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with DYAX, Corp. (“Dyax”) for worldwide, non-exclusive licenses for our patented bacterial cell expression technology in phage display. In consideration for the rights granted to Dyax, we received an upfront fee of $3.5 million. In addition, we would be eligible to receive royalties equal to 0.5% on net sales of any products subject to this license. In December 2016, we sold our rights to receive further royalties under this agreement for a payment of $11.5 million.

Sale of Biodefense Assets and Manufacturing Facility 
 On November 4, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Nanotherapeutics Inc. (the “Nanotherapeutics Purchase Agreement”), under which Nanotherapeutics agreed to acquire our biodefense business and related assets (including, subject to regulatory approval, certain contracts with the U.S. government), and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA. As part of that transaction, the parties, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, entered into an intellectual property license agreement (the “Nanotherapeutics License Agreement”), under which we agreed to license to Nanotherapeutics certain intellectual property rights related to the purchased assets. Under the Nanotherapeutics License Agreement, we are eligible for up to $4.5 million of cash payments and 23,008 shares of common stock of Nanotherapeutics, based upon Nanotherapeutics achieving certain specified future operational objectives. In addition, we are eligible to receive 15% royalties on net sales of products. In February 2017, we executed an Amendment and Restatement to both the Nanotherapeutics Purchase Agreement and Nanotherapeutics License Agreement primarily to (i) remove the obligation to issue 23,008 shares of common stock of Nanotherapeutics under the Nanotherapeutics Purchase Agreement, and (ii) revise the payment schedule related to the timing of the $4.5 million cash payments due to us under the Nanotherapeutics License Agreement. Of the $4.5 million, $3.0 million is contingent upon Nanotherapeutics achieving certain specified future operating objectives.
  On November 5, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Agenus Purchase Agreement”) with Agenus West, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc. (“Agenus”), pursuant to which Agenus agreed to acquire our pilot scale manufacturing facility in Berkeley, California, together with certain related assets, including a license to certain intellectual property related to the purchased assets, and to assume certain liabilities of XOMA, in consideration for the payment to us of up to $5.0 million in cash and the issuance to us of shares of Agenus’s common stock having an aggregate value of up to $1.0 million. The Agenus Purchase Agreement closed on December 31, 2015. At closing, we received cash of $4.7 million, net of the assumed liabilities of $0.3 million. In addition to the cash consideration, we received shares of common stock of Agenus with an aggregate value of $0.5 million, which we subsequently sold in August 2016. The remaining common stock of Agenus will only be received upon our satisfaction of certain operational matters, which we are unlikely to satisfy. 
 Sale of Future Revenue Streams 
 On December 21, 2016, we entered into two Royalty Interest Acquisition Agreements (together, the “Acquisition Agreements”) with HealthCare Royalty Partners II, L.P. (“HCRP”). Under the first Acquisition Agreement, we sold our right to receive milestone payments and royalties on future sales of products subject to a license agreement, dated August 18, 2005, between XOMA and Pfizer for an upfront cash payment of $6.5 million, plus potential additional payments totaling $4.0 million in the event three specified net sales milestones are met by Pfizer in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Under the second Acquisition Agreement, we sold all rights to royalties under an Amended and Restated License Agreement dated October 27, 2006 between XOMA and Dyax for a cash payment of $11.5 million.
Financing Agreements
 Hercules Loan and Security Agreement
 In February 2015, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc., (the “Hercules Loan Agreement”) under which we borrowed $20.0 million. We used a portion of the proceeds received under the Hercules Loan Agreement to repay the outstanding principal, final payment fee, prepayment fee, and accrued interest of $5.5 million under a loan agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation.
 The interest rate under the Hercules Loan Agreement is calculated at a rate equal to the greater of either (i) 9.40% plus the prime rate as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal minus 7.25%, and (ii) 9.40%. Payments under the Hercules Loan Agreement were interest only until June 1, 2016, after which we have paid equal monthly payments of principal and interest amortized over a 30-month schedule through the scheduled maturity date of September 1, 2018 (the “Hercules Loan Maturity Date”). The entire principal balance, including a balloon payment of principal, will be due and payable on the Hercules Loan Maturity Date. In addition, a final payment of $1.2 million will be due on the Hercules Loan Maturity Date, or such earlier date specified in the Hercules Loan Agreement. If we prepay the loan prior to the Hercules Loan Maturity Date, we may pay Hercules a prepayment charge equal to 1.00% of the amount prepaid. Our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property.
 8


The Hercules Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants, and also includes standard events of default, including payment defaults. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement. On December 21, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Hercules Amendment”) to the Hercules Loan Agreement. Under the Hercules Amendment, Hercules agreed to release its security interest on the assets subject to the Acquisition Agreements with HCRP. In turn, in January 2017, we paid $10.0 million of the outstanding principal balance owed to Hercules. The $10.0 million payment was not subject to any prepayment charge. After taking into account the January 2017 payment, the principal balance of the Hercules Loan was $6.9 million.
 In connection with the Hercules Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to Hercules that is exercisable for an aggregate of up to 9,063 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $66.20 per share (the “Hercules Warrant”). The Hercules Warrant may be exercised on a cashless basis and is exercisable for a term beginning on the date of issuance and ending on the earlier to occur of five years from the date of issuance or the consummation of certain acquisitions of XOMA as set forth in the Hercules Warrant. The number of shares for which the Hercules Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise price are subject to certain proportional adjustments as set forth in the Hercules Warrant.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses currently include costs of personnel, supplies, facilities and equipment, consultants, third-party costs and other expenses related to preclinical and clinical testing. In 2016, our research and development expenses were $44.2 million, compared with $70.9 million in 2015 and $80.7 million in 2014.
 Our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaborative and contract arrangements, which are reimbursed by our collaborators. In 2016, research and development expenses relating to internal projects were $42.8 million, compared with $50.2 million in 2015 and $51.3 million in 2014. In 2016, research and development expenses related to collaborative and contract arrangements were $1.4 million, compared with $20.7 million in 2015 and $29.4 million in 2014. In December 2016, we initiated a corporate reorganization to eliminate all activities not directly in support of X358 clinical development.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Competition in antibody-based technologies is intense and is expected to increase as new technologies emerge and established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies continue to advance in the field. A number of these large pharmaceutical and chemical companies have enhanced their capabilities by entering into arrangements with or acquiring biotechnology companies or entering into business combinations with other large pharmaceutical companies. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial resources, larger research and development and marketing staffs, and larger production facilities than ours. Moreover, certain of these companies have extensive experience in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials. These factors may enable other companies to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to ours. In addition, a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non-profit research organizations. These entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements. Furthermore, many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or, for other reasons, later. As a result, we may not be able to track development of competitive products, particularly at the early stages. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
 Without limiting the above, we are aware of the following competitors for our X358 product candidate: Biodel, Inc.; Eiger Biopharmaceuticals; Eli Lilly and Company; Locemia Solutions; S-cubed Limited; Xeris Pharmaceuticals and Zealand Pharma A/S. This list is not intended to be representative of all existing competitors in the market.

Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing, import, export and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries.
 Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The nature and extent of the governmental review process for our product candidates will vary, depending on the regulatory categorization of particular product candidates and various other factors.
 The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include:
  
• | preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated annually with a report on development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologic license application (“BLA”), which must often be accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites for Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), compliance; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA and product prescribing information prior to any commercial sale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our licensees. Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing may not be completed within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier-stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and effectiveness in subsequent trials. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 10


The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the biopharmaceutical product. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our licensees interpret data. The FDA also may convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committee’s recommendation. The submission of a BLA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDA’s review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of the application, while priority review is eight months from submission of the application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require risk management programs and post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), which limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Orphan drugs are those intended for use in rare diseases or conditions. As a result of the high cost of development and the low return on investment for rare diseases, certain governments provide regulatory and commercial incentives for the development of drugs for small disease populations. In the United States, the term ‘‘rare disease or condition’’ means any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Applications for U.S. orphan drug status are evaluated and granted by the Office of Orphan Products Development (“OOPD”) of the FDA and must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the United States, orphan drugs are subject to the standard regulatory process for marketing approval but are exempt from the payment of user fees for licensure, may receive market exclusivity for a period of seven years and some tax benefits, and are eligible for OOPD grants. If a product with orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or market the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Patents and Trade Secrets
 Patent and trade secret protection are important to our business and our future will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. As a result of our ongoing activities, we hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and important processes. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“Patent Office”) with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies or others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patent applications.

We have established a portfolio of patents in the United States, Europe and certain other countries for our insulin receptor antibody programs. European Patent 2 480 254 and Japanese patent 5849050 cover insulin receptor-modulating antibodies having the functional properties of X358. U.S. Patent No. 8,926,976 covering insulin receptor-activating antibodies having the functional properties of the lead antibody in our XMetA program, subsequently licensed to Novo Nordisk. WO2016/141111 relates to methods of treating or preventing post-prandial hypoglycemia after gastric bypass surgery using a negative modulator antibody to the insulin receptor. WO2017/024285 relates to methods of treating or preventing hypoglycemia using a negative modulator antibody fragment that binds to the insulin receptor. Additional patent applications covering our insulin receptor antibody programs are pending in the U.S. and certain other countries.
 We have exclusive worldwide rights to a family of patents relating to our prolactin receptor antibody program, X213, following return of the program by Novartis. Issued patents in the family include US Patent No. 7,867,493 and EP 2 059 535.
 We have established a portfolio of patents in the United States, Europe and certain other countries for our gevokizumab program. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,531,166 (which expires in 2027) and 7,582,742 cover gevokizumab and other antibodies and antibody fragments with similar binding properties for IL-1 beta, as well as nucleic acids, expression vectors and production cell lines for the manufacture of such antibodies and antibody fragments. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,695,718, 8,101,166, 8,586,036, 8,545,846, 8,377,429 and 9,163,082 relate to methods of treating Type 2 diabetes or Type 2 diabetes-induced diseases or conditions with high affinity antibodies and antibody fragments that bind to IL-1 beta, including gevokizumab. U.S. Patent No. 8,637,029 relates to methods of treating gout with certain doses of IL-1 beta binding antibodies or binding fragments. Additional U.S. Patents relate to methods of treating certain IL-1 related inflammatory diseases, TI DM, certain cancers, certain IL-1 beta related coronary conditions, inflammatory eye disease or uveitis, with gevokizumab or other IL-1 beta antibodies and fragments having similar binding properties. U.S. Patent Nos. 8,551,487 and 9,139,646 relate to methods of treating refractory uveitis with IL-1 beta binding antibodies and binding fragments. Also, patents have been granted by the European Patent Office and certain other countries for gevokizumab, as well as nucleic acids, expression vectors and production cell lines for the manufacture of gevokizumab.
 In October 2015, we announced that we had exclusively licensed the global development and commercialization rights to our TGFβ antibody program to Novartis. The licensed intellectual property includes US Patent Nos. 8,569,464 and 9,145,458 covering our lead TGFβ antibodies and methods of use thereof, and WO2016/161410 relating to combination therapy using an inhibitor of TGFb and an inhibitor of PD-1 for treating or preventing recurrence of cancer.
 We established a portfolio of patents related to our bacterial expression technology, including claims to methods for expression and secretion of recombinant proteins from bacteria, including immunoglobulin gene products, and improved methods and cells for expression of recombinant protein products. We have granted more than 60 licenses to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use the Company’s patented and proprietary technologies relating to bacterial expression of recombinant pharmaceutical products. The last-to-expire patent licensed under the majority of these license agreements is Canadian patent 1,341,235, which is expected to expire in May 2018.
 If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others issue and are upheld, we may require certain licenses from others in order to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology. There can be no assurance that such licenses, if required, will be available on acceptable terms.
 Where appropriate, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. These parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that we or our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others, we may have disputes with our collaborators or consultants or other third parties as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 When and if we are able to generate income, a portion of that income may be derived from product sales and other activities outside the United States. 
 We have determined that we operate in one business segment as we only report operating results on an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker of XOMA. Our property and equipment is held in the United States.
 Financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate and segment information is included in Note 14 to the December 31, 2016, Financial Statements: Concentration of Risk, Segment and Geographic Information.
 12


Concentration of Risk
  Five Prime, Servier, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”) accounted for 27 percent, 22 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, of our total revenue in 2016. In 2015, Novartis accounted for 67 percent of our total revenue. NIAID and Servier accounted for 51 percent and 28 percent, respectively, of our total revenue in 2014. At December 31, 2016, NIAID accounted for 85 percent of the accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2015, Five Prime, NIAID, Servier and Centocor accounted for 39 percent, 25 percent, 18 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the accounts receivable balance. None of these parties represent a related party to XOMA and the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material effect on our business and financial condition.
Employees
 As of March 14, 2017, we employed 18 full-time employees at our headquarters in Berkeley, California. In addition, there are seven employees who will terminate employment on either March 31, 2017 or June 30, 2017 in connection with the restructuring activities in December 2016. None of our employees are unionized. Our employees are primarily engaged in clinical operations and in executive, business development, finance and administrative positions.
