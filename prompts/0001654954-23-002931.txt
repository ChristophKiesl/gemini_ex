Currently, our strategy is to focus initially on the automotive industry, developing relationships today to scale with our customers for their future EV charging infrastructure requirements. Customers vary from dealership groups that own and operate multiple campuses representing multiple auto brands to dealerships representing a single brand. We also work with multi-family housing developments focused on providing public charging capabilities to residents that lack individually owned parking or garage space. 

Our projects can vary in length from three to twelve months on average and depend on size, complexity, availability of EVSE, electrical components and coordination with local utilities for upgrades and incentive coordination. Projects typically include site evaluation, hardware consultation, design, engineering, construction and installation. Expert project management, tailored service and customer education are critical components impacting the entire customer experience. 

Our plan is to provide monitoring and maintenance on all projects thus generating recurring revenue. We are developing the technology specific to EVSE equipment to allow customers transparent and seamless monitoring of equipment regardless of hardware type and utilization. 

Fleet Services

Our Fleet infrastructure business is focused on real estate solutions for commercial and fleet operators requiring parking. Our vision is to provide EV charging capabilities to these facilities and provide customers with a turnkey solution for parking and electrifying their fleets. 

We offer our services through our operating subsidiary EVDepot, LLC (“EVDepot”). Based on our knowledge of the real estate market, we are able to find properties that would be desirable to fleet operators and secure leases for further re-lease to tenants. Our customers rely on our industry knowledge and relationships to secure the best locations for their business. As a result of our real estate development expertise, we may also be engaged to provide services on the property such as lighting, paving or security. 

Our Fleet business properties are typically located close to shipping ports, airports, and major thoroughfares. Currently, our properties are primarily within the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Backlog

Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue, within our Infrastructure segment, that we expect to realize on future work related to uncompleted projects, new contracts under which work has not begun, and change orders.  We only include projects within our backlog reporting if there is a signed contract, purchase order or other legally binding arrangement. Our projects can vary in length from several weeks to well over 18 months. Timing of revenue recognition for backlog projects can fluctuate due to customer changes, delays, supply chain disruptions or other project-related factors. There can be no assurance if actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Backlog differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $82 million in estimated revenue in our backlog.

Telecommunications Segment

Telecommunications provides routing of voice, data, and Short Message Services (“SMS”) to Carriers and Mobile Network Operators (“MNO”) globally and operates through our wholly owned subsidiary PTGi International Carrier Services, Inc. (“PTGi”). Our Telecommunications business has contractual relationships with service providers in over 45 countries primarily within Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and North and South America. We provide customers with internet-protocol-based and time-division multiplexing (“TDM”) access for the transport of long-distance voice and data minutes.

We operate a global telecommunications network consisting of domestic switching and related peripheral equipment, carrier-grade routers, and switches for internet and circuit-based services. To ensure high-quality communications services, our network employs digital switching and fiber optic technologies, incorporates the use of voice- over -internet protocols and Signaling System7 (“SS7/C7”) signaling, and is supported by comprehensive network monitoring and technical support services.

In select countries where competition with traditional post telegraph and telecommunications companies (“PTTs”) is limited, we have entered into foreign carrier agreements with other PTTs, or similar service providers to provide traffic into these countries and receive such countries’ traffic in return. We maintain relations with approximately 200 wholesale carriers, or similar providers, all of which are at-will arrangements. 

Telecommunications owns and operates network management systems in Ashburn, Virginia to monitor and control our switching systems, global data network, and other digital transmission equipment. Additional network monitoring, network management, and traffic management services are supported from our network management centers located in Guatemala City, Guatemala and Bucharest, Romania. The network management control centers provide 24/7 online service.

Growth Strategy

Our strategy is to drive growth within Infrastructure by leveraging our operating subsidiaries, investing in the high growth areas of EV charging and broadband, and acquiring strategic companies that will broaden our geographic footprint and skill teams. Our focus is as follows: 

· | Organic growth across our Infrastructure segment, particularly within EV charging. We plan to continue investing in people, processes and tools to enable organic growth. Our strategy is to prioritize the automotive industry, in particular, retail dealerships and fleet businesses, which must invest in charging infrastructure guided by OEM mandated timelines. In addition, state and federal initiatives in some instances are also mandating the transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to battery electric vehicles by 2035 or even sooner. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | We are fostering relationships today with the goal of establishing sustainability for future EV charging infrastructure scalability; educating customers on the multiple waves of investments that will be required to meet the potential future growth demands of EVs and charging infrastructure. We are investing and developing custom software solutions for our clients to manage and monitor EV charging infrastructure, creating a recurring revenue stream and incremental maintenance opportunities for us. We believe that as EV adoption continues to accelerate, so does the importance of cloud services powered by high-speed broadband to facilitate effective and efficient charging infrastructure. While we are initially prioritizing the automotive industry, our bespoke, seamless solutions, along with end-to-end services, client-centric approach and processes collectively translates to address all industry segments, including multifamily residential housing, retail locations, parking facilities, and fleet depots. We also plan to leverage relationships with customers and other alliances in this space to further develop revenue streams to create redundant and resilient power solutions, encompassing energy management and power storage, home installation services, financial, insurance or warranty services, and renewable energy collaborations among others. With our various operating subsidiaries, we are positioned to capitalize on this intersection of EV charging and broadband needs.
· | Strategic acquisitions. We continue to target possible acquisitions that expand scale, capacity, capabilities, channel distribution, and geographic reach. We focus on companies with design, engineering and project management capabilities with efficient operations, profits to reinvest and management with deep experience that will seamlessly integrate into the Company and propel our vision. 
· | Expand technology-based tools and solutions. We intend to leverage our monitoring and maintenance service currently available for broadband customers and offer a similar service for EV charging which could expand the Company’s recurring revenue streams. This is already under development and will include a central monitoring dashboard , real-time incident reporting, automated service requests, remote service repairs when possible, and physical maintenance dispatching. In addition, we continue to research and develop other technology-based capabilities such as mobile applications, white label operating software, and dynamic energy management solutions. Our intention is for this suite of technology to complement and add to our existing services that will support our custom infrastructure solutions. Finally, our operations and technology teams continue to work on digital tools for our team members to provide services more efficiently and accurately to customers, modernize the process and shorten the length of projects.

Competition

Infrastructure

The businesses within our Infrastructure segment face competition from other charging and docking suppliers as they attempt to win the business of cities, wireless carriers, private companies, fleet managers and resellers. We compete based on price, relationship, presence, and the quality of our products and services.  

Our Broadband and Wireless business and Electrical Contracting Services Businesses face competition from local, regional, and national players. The competition is highly fragmented, categorized by specialized service providers in the network, tower, construction, engineering, and electrical industry. These companies range from small local independent companies to large national firms, including Mastec, Inc., Black Veatch Holdings, Jacobs Solutions, Inc., Henkels & McCoy, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Quanta Services, Inc., Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Samsung Electronics America, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Motorola Mobility, LLC, Crown Castle International Corp, American Tower Corporation, and SBA Communications Corporation. 

Our EVC infrastructure business faces competition from other EV charger installers. We believe our business model is differentiated by continued and consistent education of this emerging EVC space to both industry players and the client, providing dedicated client engagement and committed, thorough end-to-end project management with the goal of delivering a quality work product with integrity.

Our fleet infrastructure business faces competition from local, regional and national firms in the purchase or lease of real property. We also face competition from companies that provide fleet parking, trailer parking and drop yards, logistic groups with large yards, underutilized industrial space, and malls, buildings and real estate investment trusts with excess parking.

Telecommunications

Long Distance: We face significant competition as we attempt to expand our business from other telecommunications carriers and resellers. We compete on the basis of price, service quality, financial strength, relationship and presence. Sales of wholesale long-distance voice minutes are generated by connecting one telecommunications operator to another and charging a fee to do so.

Over-the- top (“OTT”) Applications: OTT Applications, such as WhatsApp, Skype, and FaceTime, continue to impact our long-distance business model. There can be no assurance that the current declines in the long-distance business globally driven by these applications will not increase; or that our business will not be impacted by the increased consumer adoption of such applications globally.

Government Regulation

Infrastructure

Infrastructure is subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and numerous other laws and regulations, among them:

· | Building and electrical codes; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents;
· | contractor licensing requirements; 
· | permitting and inspection requirements; 
· | regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation; and 
· | cyber data protection and security. 


11


We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business.

Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ among those jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes will not have a material adverse effect on us, domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance with applicable regulations, or regulatory activities will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regulation impacting the greater EV industry continues to change rapidly in many jurisdictions which may affect the businesses advantageously or adversely depending on the decisions made.

Telecommunications

We are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ among those jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that future regulatory, judicial, and legislative changes or activities will not have a material adverse effect on us, or that domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our regulatory compliance. 

Regulation impacting the telecommunications industry continues to change rapidly in many jurisdictions. Privacy related laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation, USA’s Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (“TRACED”) and associated caller identification authentication and fraudulent robocall mitigation rules, as well as privatization, deregulation, changes in regulation, consolidation, and technological change have had, and will continue to have, significant effects on the industry. Although we believe that deregulation with respect to portions of the telecommunications industry will continue and create opportunities for firms such as us, there can be no assurance that deregulation will continue, or if any regulatory changes implemented would benefit us. 

As of December 31, 2022, our operating services are subject to the following material frameworks:

United States

In the United States, our Telecommunications services are subject to the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”); other federal laws; the rules and orders of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”); and the applicable laws and regulations of the various states. 
International Service Regulation 

The FCC has jurisdiction over common carrier services linking points in the U.S. to points in other countries and we provide such services. Providers of such international common carrier services must obtain authority from the FCC under Section 214 of the Communications Act. We have obtained the authorizations required to use, on a facilities-based and resale basis, various transmission media for the provision of international switched services and international private line services on a non-dominant carrier basis. The FCC is considering a number of possible changes to its rules governing international common carriers. We cannot predict how the FCC will resolve those issues or how its decisions will affect our international business. FCC rules permit non-dominant carriers such as us to offer some services on a de-tariffed basis, to compete to provide consumers with lower rates and choices among carriers and services. 

12


In furtherance of its existing caller identification and fraudulent robocall mitigation rules, the FCC has adopted additional regulations for carriers delivering foreign-based call traffic to points in the U.S., including regulations that require us to comply with, in the internet protocol (“IP”) portions of our network the FCC’s Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (“STIR”) / Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information Using Tokens (“SHAKEN”) caller identification authentication framework to foreign-originated calls carrying U.S. numbers and to implement robocall mitigation practices for such calls, including an obligation to respond to traceback requests within 24 hours, implement mandatory call blocking based on existing FCC rules for US-originated calls, and implement know-your-customer policies. We already comply with all existing caller identification authentication and robocall mitigation rules applicable to our call traffic and have filed in the FCC’s Robocall Mitigation Database our robocall mitigation plan and the necessary certification confirming our compliance with the FCC’s caller identification and/or fraudulent robocall mitigation rules. To the extent the FCC adopts any further caller identification and/or fraudulent robocall mitigation rules applicable to our call traffic, we will comply with said rules.

Domestic Service Regulation 

With respect to our domestic communications services, PTGi is considered a non-dominant interstate carrier subject to regulation by the FCC. FCC rules provide us significant authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to assume control of another telecommunications carrier or its assets, to transfer control of our operations to another entity, or to discontinue service. We are also required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments to the FCC and various state commissions. Among other things, interstate common carriers must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates. The FCC has jurisdiction to hear complaints regarding our compliance or non-compliance with these and other requirements of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules.  

FCC rules also require certain providers of retail long distance voice service to generate and retain various records regarding completion of calls to rural areas. Specifically, the rules require those providers to collect and retain information on long-distance call attempts such as, but not limited to, the called number, the date and time of the call, and the use of an intermediate provider. The rules also prohibit false audible ringing (the premature triggering of audible ring tones to the caller before the call setup request has reached the terminating service provider). While we are not directly subject to these rules, we may function as an intermediate provider within the meaning of these rules, which may require us to provide information to our customers regarding calls that we carry on their behalf. In addition, under Section 262 to the Communications Act of 1934, intermediate providers, such as us must register with the FCC and meet certain quality standards (now embodied in the FCC’s rules). 

Interstate and international telecommunications carriers are required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”). Carriers providing wholesale telecommunications services are not required to contribute with respect to services sold to customers that provide a written certification that the customers themselves will make the required contributions. We believe that we are in compliance with our USF obligations. If the FCC or the USF Administrator were to determine that the USF reporting for the Company, including our Communications services, are not accurate or in compliance with FCC rules, we could be subject to additional contributions, as well as to monetary fines and penalties. In addition, the FCC may revise its USF contribution mechanisms and the services considered when calculating the contribution. We cannot predict the outcome of any such revisions or their potential effect on our contribution obligations. Some changes to the USF under consideration by the FCC may affect certain entities more than others, and we may be disadvantaged as compared to our competitors as a result of FCC decisions regarding USF. In addition, the FCC may extend the obligation to contribute to the USF to certain services that we offer but that are not currently assessed USF contributions. 

FCC rules require providers that originate interstate or intrastate traffic on or destined for the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) to transmit the telephone number associated with the calling party to the next provider in the call path. Intermediate providers, such as ourselves, must pass calling party number (“CPN”) or charge number (“CN”) signaling information they receive from other providers unaltered, to subsequent providers in the call path. While we believe that we are in compliance with this rule, to the extent that we pass traffic that does not have appropriate CPN or CN information, we could be subject to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties.

Employees and Human Capital

As of December 31, 2022, we had 385 team members (“Team Members”), comprised of 332 employees, of whom 75 were represented by Unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements, and 53 contractors/temporary labor. Of this total workforce, 317 were employed or contracted with Infrastructure, and 42 were employed or contracted with Telecommunications and 26 were employed or contracted with our non-operating Corporate segment.

13


Many of our activities are outsourced to contractors and consultants who provide services related to our operations and financial support. We believe there are available contractors with appropriate subject matter expertise for our current and near-term needs. We retain each contractor and consultant according to the terms of an agreement. Under such agreements, we generally pay them a fee and reimburse them for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us. In addition, we have in the past and may again in the future grant options to purchase our common stock to contractors and consultants, subject to the vesting requirements contained in their agreements. Our contractors and consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer or may have other arrangements that may limit their availability to us.

We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. To enable us to further develop and execute our growth strategy we will need to maintain and continue to hire additional experienced personnel as well as to rely on third-party contractors and consultants for certain activities.

We are committed to a work environment that is welcoming, inclusive and encouraging, and we believe that we can be at our best when we bring together diverse teams with different perspectives, experiences and ideas. In furtherance of our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and diverse perspectives in our organization, when evaluating candidates for nominations as new directors, we actively seek qualified persons of diverse backgrounds in the nomination process, as detailed in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, 401(k) plan with matching benefits, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others. We have also historically offered our employees the ability to work remotely and expect to continue to do so in the future. These benefits provide our employees choices where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families, as well as access to tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors to improve their physical and mental health.

Significant Customers

The Company has two customers whose revenue individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue and whose revenue in aggregate accounted for approximately 36% of the Company’s total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. While we have other important customers, no other individual customer represents more than 10% of net sales.
Corporate History; Significant Organizational Events

We were originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 8, 2003, under the name “E-Education Network, Inc.” On August 10, 2005, we changed our name to “GoIP Global, Inc.” In December, 2017, we redomiciled from Nevada to Colorado. In connection with our acquisition of the Transworld Enterprises business (described below), we changed our name to “Transworld Holdings, Inc.” on August 7, 2020 and converted from a Colorado corporation to a Delaware corporation on October 1, 2020.  As our business continued to evolve and grow, on January 26, 2021, we adopted our current name of “Charge Enterprises, Inc.”

On April 30, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Transworld Enterprises pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, dated April 30, 2020, by and among us, Transworld Enterprises, and the shareholders of Transworld Enterprises (the “Share Exchange Agreement”).
