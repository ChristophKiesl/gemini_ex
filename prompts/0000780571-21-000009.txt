The following is a discussion of our solutions, our markets, and our operating segments. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific segment results.
Our Business 
The way the world manages energy and water will be one of the defining actions of this century. At Itron, we are committed to creating a more resourceful world—one where energy, water, and city resources are managed safely, securely, and reliably, to help improve day-to-day life and promote the well-being of people around the world. We invent new ways for cities and utilities to work together so they can cost-effectively leverage the same infrastructure to deliver multiple services and applications on a reliable, intelligent platform capable of serving all their customers.
Itron helps our customers adapt to a rapidly changing world and address a number of macro trends, including: 
•Infrastructure – such as aging infrastructure, grid security, renewable energy and storage, and incorporating electric vehicles into the grid
•Environmental – such as extreme weather, resource scarcity and sustainability, safety, monitoring, and management
•Social – such as increased customer expectations, urbanization, population increase, and the management of "big data" and incorporating IIoT technology into their existing operations. 
Our solutions include the deployment of smart networks, software, services, devices, sensors and data analytics upon a platform that allows our customers to not only address the changing macro environment listed above but also to address pressing industry challenges to better manage assets, secure revenue, lower operational costs, improve customer service, develop new business models and revenue streams, improve safety, and enable efficient management of valuable resources. Our comprehensive solutions and data analytics also help our customers address operational issues including increasing demand on resources, non-technical loss, leak detection, environmental and regulatory compliance, integrating renewable and distributed energy sources, and improving operational reliability. 
Itron solutions include technology, software, and services delivered as part of a standalone, one-time purchase or end-to-end solution over multiple years. The portfolio includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing with and without communications capability; a combination of endpoints and network infrastructure with embedded intelligence that is designed and sold as a complete solution to acquire and transport application-specific data; and value-added services, software, and products that organize, analyze, and interpret data to gain insights, make decisions, and inform actions. We also offer managed services, software-as-a-service (SaaS), network-as-a-service (NaaS), technical support services, licensing hardware technology, and consulting services.
Industry Drivers
Utility and municipalities are undergoing an evolution in how they operate critical infrastructure, manage scarce resources, and interact with their customers. Efficiently managing resources within energy, water, and cities is a top priority globally, as increasing populations and resource consumption continues to stress an aging infrastructure. The growing demand for energy, water, and municipal services coupled with the proliferation of renewable energy sources, smart communicating devices, sensors, and multiple data-producing technologies is forcing providers to rethink how they operate and service their communities. This evolution comes at a time when utilities and municipalities are challenged by cost constraints, regulatory requirements, environmental concerns, safety, and resource scarcity. Itron provides its customers with a solution-based offering to safely, securely, and reliably optimize their critical infrastructure to improve the efficiency of their services and to better understand their customers with near real-time knowledge of their resource usage. An added benefit of our solutions is the utility or municipality can empower their customers to understand and have control over their resource usage, allowing for better management and conservation of valuable resources.
To address these challenges, utilities and cities are looking to leverage innovations across a networked platform such as edge (or distributed) intelligence to build and maintain critical infrastructure that can: 
•Efficiently and effectively operate energy and water systems that are safe, reliable, and resilient
•Reduce the risk and impact of natural disasters
•Think for itself, repair itself, and anticipate problems before they occur
•Deliver enhanced, more personalized services at lower cost
•Accommodate next-generation services through shared infrastructure between utilities and cities/municipalities
•Provide actionable insights for asset management
Our Operating Segments
We operate under the Itron brand worldwide and manage and report under three operating segments: Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and Outcomes. The following is a description of each of the three segments:
Device Solutions – This segment primarily includes hardware products used for measurement, control, or sensing that do not have communications capability embedded for use with our broader Itron systems, i.e., hardware-based products not part of a complete "end-to-end" solution. Examples from the Device Solutions portfolio include: standard endpoints that are shipped without Itron communications, such as our standard gas, electricity, and water meters for a variety of global markets and adhering to regulations and standards within those markets, as well as our heat and allocation products; communicating meters that are not a part of an Itron end-to-end solution such as Smart Spec meters; and the implementation and installation of non-communicating devices, such as gas regulators.
Networked Solutions – This segment primarily includes a combination of communicating devices (e.g., smart meters, modules, endpoints, and sensors), network infrastructure, and associated application software designed and sold as a complete solution for acquiring and transporting robust application-specific data. Networked Solutions includes products and software for the implementation, installation, and management of communicating devices and data networks. Examples from the Networked Solutions portfolio include: communicating measurement, control, or sensing endpoints such as our Itron® and OpenWay® Riva meters, Itron traditional ERT® technology, Intelis smart gas or water meters, 500G gas communication modules, 500W water communication modules; GenX networking products, network modules and interface cards; and specific network control and management software applications. The IIoT solutions supported by this segment include automated meter reading (AMR), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), smart grid and distribution automation, smart street lighting and an ever-growing set of smart city applications such as traffic management, smart parking, air quality monitoring, electric vehicle charging, customer engagement, digital signage, acoustic (e.g., gunshot) detection, and leak detection and mitigation for both gas and water systems. Our IIoT platform allows all of these industry and smart city applications to be run and managed on a single, multi-purpose network.
Outcomes – This segment primarily includes our value-added, enhanced software and services in which we manage, organize, analyze, and interpret data to improve decision making, maximize operational profitability, drive resource efficiency, and deliver results for consumers, utilities, and smart cities. Outcomes places an emphasis on delivering to Itron customers high-value, turn-key, digital experiences by leveraging the footprint of our Device Solutions and Networked Solutions segments. The revenues from these offerings are primarily recurring in nature and would include any direct management of Device Solutions, Networked Solutions, and other products on behalf of our end customers. Examples from the Outcomes portfolio include: our meter data management and analytics offerings; our managed service solutions including NaaS and platform-as-a-service, forecasting software and services; our Distributed Intelligence suite of 
applications and services; and any consulting-based engagement. Within the Outcomes segment, we also identify new business models, including performance-based contracting, to drive broader portfolio offerings across utilities and cities.
Bookings and Backlog of Orders
Bookings for a reported period represent customer contracts and purchase orders received during the period for hardware, software, and services that have met certain conditions, such as regulatory and/or contractual approval. Total backlog represents committed but undelivered products and services for contracts and purchase orders at period-end. Twelve-month backlog represents the portion of total backlog that we estimate will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Backlog is not a complete measure of our future revenues as we also receive significant book-and-ship orders, as well as frame contracts. Bookings and backlog may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of large project awards. In addition, annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. Beginning total backlog, plus bookings, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to miscellaneous contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Total bookings and backlog include certain contracts with termination for convenience clauses, which will not agree to the total transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations disclosed in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17: Revenues.

Year Ended | Total Bookings | | Total Backlog | | 12-Month Backlog
In millions | | | | | 
December 31, 2020 | $ | 2,213 | | | $ | 3,259 | | $ | 1,204
December 31, 2019 | 2,551 | | | 3,207 | | | 1,499
December 31, 2018 | 2,515 | | | 3,173 | | | 1,349

Sales and Distribution
We use a combination of direct and indirect sales channels in our operating segments. A direct sales force is utilized for large electric, natural gas, and water utilities, with which we have long-established relationships. This direct sales force is focused on solution selling, solving problems and business challenges, and delivering valuable outcomes to our utility and smart city customers. For smaller utilities and municipalities, we typically use an indirect sales channel that extends the reach of Itron's solutions by empowering trusted partners with the right tools, training, and technology to grow their business, deliver results, and help these customers better manage energy and water. These channels consist of distributors, sales representatives, partners, and meter manufacturer representatives.
No single customer represented more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 33% of total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 31% in 2019 and 2018.
Manufacturing
Our products require a wide variety of components and materials, which are subject to price and supply fluctuations. We enter into standard purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which can include purchase orders for specific quantities based on market prices, as well as open-ended agreements that provide for estimated quantities over an extended shipment period, typically up to one year at an established unit cost. Although we have multiple sources of supply for many of our material requirements, certain components and raw materials are supplied by limited or sole-source vendors, and our ability to perform certain contracts depends on the availability of these materials. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for further discussion related to manufacturing and supply risks.
Our manufacturing facilities are located throughout the world, an overview of which is presented in Item 2: Properties. While we manufacture and assemble a portion of our products, we outsource the manufacturing of many products to various manufacturing partners and drive to create an efficient and cost effective structure. This approach allows us to reduce the costs related to our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing customer demand. These manufacturing partners assemble our sub-assemblies and products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish and procure components and assemble our products based on demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions, as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Partners
In connection with delivering solutions and systems to our customers, we frequently partner with third-party vendors to provide hardware, software, or services, e.g., meter installation and communication network equipment and infrastructure. Due to the interoperable, open-standards based nature of our platform, we have also cultivated a highly diverse and growing ecosystem of partners and third-party developers who can create complementary solutions for our customers that run on the same network and within the same platform framework.
Our ability to perform on our contractual obligations with our customers is dependent on these partners meeting their obligations to us. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for further discussion related to third-party vendors and strategic partners.
Research and Development
Our research and development is focused on both improving existing technology and developing innovative new technology for electricity, natural gas, water and heat endpoints, sensing and control devices, data collection software, communication technologies, data warehousing, software applications, and the IIoT. We invested approximately $194 million, $202 million, and $208 million in research and development in 2020, 2019 and 2018, which represented 9%, 8% and 9% of total revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for further discussion related to costs of developing competitive products and services.

Competition
We enable utilities and cities to safely, securely, and reliably deliver critical infrastructure services to communities in more than 100 countries. Our portfolio of smart networks, software, services, meters, and sensors help our customers better manage electricity, gas, water, and city infrastructure resources for the people they serve. Consequently, we operate within a large and complex competitive landscape, and our competitors range from small companies to large, established corporations. Some of our competitors have diversified product portfolios and participate in multiple geographic markets, while others focus on specific regional markets and/or certain types of products, including some low-cost suppliers of devices based in China and India. Our primary competitors include Landis+Gyr (formerly part of Toshiba); Hubbell (formerly Aclara Inc.); Xylem, Inc. (formerly Sensus); Badger Meter, Inc.; and Mueller Water Products. 
We believe that our competitive advantage is based on our in-depth knowledge of the industries we serve, our capacity to innovate, and our ability to provide complete end-to-end integrated solutions. We also differentiate ourselves with an intelligent IIoT platform that is solution, device, and transport agnostic—a platform that is: backwards compatible and future proofed; able to run a multitude of applications and solutions across it; is highly secure, fully integrated into our portfolio, and highly interoperable; captures, relays, and leverages high-resolution data for near real-time decision making; and includes an ever-growing, diverse ecosystem of partners and third-party developers who can create and deploy very specific point solutions across our network for even greater value for our customers.
We are a global leader in the IIoT category; an industry leader in communication modules deployed; a leading industry innovator; a leader in electricity, gas, and water end-to-end solutions; and a global leader in meters under managed services. We 
continue to serve our established customer relationships, and expand upon our track record of delivering reliable, accurate, and long-lived products and services.
Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for a discussion of the competitive pressures we face.
Strategic Alliances
We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce product advancement and acceleration of entry into new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, research and development, joint sales and marketing, or access to new geographic markets. Refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with strategic alliances.
Intellectual Property
Our patents and patent applications cover a range of technologies, which relate to standard metering, smart metering solutions and technology, meter data management software, knowledge application solutions, and IIoT. We also rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, and trade secrets to protect our products and technologies. Disputes over the ownership, registration, and enforcement of intellectual property rights arise in the ordinary course of our business. While we believe patents and trademarks are important to our operations and, in aggregate, constitute valuable assets, no single patent or trademark, or group of patents or trademarks, is critical to the success of our business. We license some of our technology to other companies, some of which are our competitors.
Environmental Regulations
In the ordinary course of our business we use metals, solvents, and similar materials that are stored on-site. We believe that we are materially in compliance with environmental laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the operation of our business.
