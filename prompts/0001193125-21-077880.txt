This transaction is referred to as the Business Combination. Immediately following the Business Combination, Panacea changed its name to Nuvation Bio Inc. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, our Class A common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock began trading on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbols NUVB and NUVB.WS, respectively, on February 11, 2021. The disclosure in Items 1 and 1A of this report gives effect to the Business Combination and includes the operations of Legacy Nuvation Bio prior to the Business Combination. 
Business Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company tackling some of the greatest unmet needs in oncology by developing differentiated and novel therapeutic candidates. We were founded by our chief executive officer, David Hung, M.D., who founded Medivation, Inc. and led its successful development of oncology drugs Xtandi® and talazoparib (now marketed as Talzenna®), leading to its $14.3 billion sale to Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) in 2016. We leverage our teams extensive expertise in medicinal chemistry and drug development to pursue oncology targets validated by strong clinical or preclinical data and discover novel small molecules that improve the activity and overcome the liabilities of currently marketed drugs or best-in-development therapeutic candidates. In addition to our focus on development of small molecules for validated targets, we are also developing novel therapeutic candidates based on our Drug-Drug Conjugate (DDC) platform. Utilizing this platform, we are able to conjugate tissue-selective targeted small molecules with anti-tumor agents to create unique therapeutic candidates. We began dosing high-grade glioma patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our lead product candidate in December 2020 and expect to report top-line data from the Phase 1 portion of this trial in 2022. We plan to initiate multiple other Phase 1 trials through 2022 and to submit up to an additional five IND applications over the next six years across our pipeline of therapeutic product candidates. 
 Our fully integrated discovery and development team is developing a wholly owned pipeline of targeted oncology product candidates. Our lead product candidate, NUV-422, is a selective inhibitor of key regulators of cell cycle checkpoints cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 2/4/6. An IND, or a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, was accepted, and we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NUV-422 for the treatment of high-grade gliomas in December 2020. Our second product candidate is NUV-868, a novel inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family member BRD4, currently in preclinical studies. Our third candidate, NUV-569, is a selective inhibitor of the Wee1 kinase, initially being pursued in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors. We are also characterizing multiple potential lead product candidates from our DDC platform, including NUV-1156, a targeted tumor cell inhibitor that binds to androgen receptor (AR)-expressing tissues such as the prostate, and NUV-1176, which binds to estrogen receptor (ER)-expressing tissues such as breast. 
 Our focused approach to address major unmet needs in oncology leverages our groups significant expertise in discovery, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and commercialization. Through these approaches we have created substantial intellectual property around the composition of matter for our new chemical entities. The foundations of our approach include: 
 

 | The pursuit of validated targets: We identify and pursue oncology targets validated by strong clinical or preclinical data that provide a high degree of confidence in generating clinically meaningful benefit. We focus on targets where there has been some progress by others in generating clinical candidates or FDA-approved drugs, and we then attempt to design novel therapeutic candidates to overcome the encountered safety liabilities or limitations in efficacy. As an example, in preclinical studies, our lead product candidate, NUV-422, has demonstrated improvements in potency and selectivity of the CDK target class to reduce off-target toxic effects and to overcome specific drug-resistance mechanisms and improve anti-tumor activity.

 | Innovative medicinal chemistry expertise. We use our medicinal chemistry capabilities to generate differentiated therapeutic candidates, focused on improving their safety, anti-tumor activity and pharmacologic profiles over other standard of care (SOC) therapies. We also use innovative medicinal chemistry approaches to generate novel classes of molecules such as our DDCs.

 | A precision oncology approach: Wherever beneficial and practical, we are pursuing a precision approach, initially selecting patients we believe are most likely to respond in indications involving serious or life-threatening conditions in which there is significant unmet medical need. In these indications, we believe that, depending on the results of our preclinical studies, our product candidates could potentially be considered for the FDAs accelerated approval process based on their potential to demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.

 The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline: 
 


Our lead product candidate, NUV-422, was designed to be a brain-penetrant second-generation CDK4/6 inhibitor with the additional ability to inhibit CDK2, a cell cycle checkpoint found to be altered in many patients with high-grade gliomas including glioblastoma (GBM) and also recognized as a mechanism of resistance to currently marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer. NUV-422 also was designed to limit CDK1 inhibition, a potential cause of toxicity in current second-generation inhibitors in development. Currently marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors generated more than $6.0 billion of sales in 2019 and are expected to grow to $14.0 billion of sales in 2025, reflecting the significant patient benefit of this therapeutic class of drugs. We believe that a CDK2/4/6 inhibitor that avoids CDK1 inhibition can bring greater benefit to a broader patient population. We are also advancing NUV-422 to treat patients with breast cancer and potentially other cancer patients with brain metastases, where FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown limited efficacy. Additionally, we are advancing NUV-422 to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (ER+ mBC) where CDK4/6 inhibitors have been successful but CDK2-driven resistance to therapy can develop. Furthermore, we also intend to develop NUV-422 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to NUV-422 for the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. We began dosing high-grade glioma patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NUV-422 in December 2020. We plan to expand into a cohort of genetically defined high-grade glioma patients who have a deletion of CDKN2A, a genetic marker of CDK2 activity. CDKN2A deletions are found in nearly 70% of high-grade glioma patients. We anticipate reporting data from the Phase 1 portion of this trial in 2022. 
 Our second product candidate, NUV-868 is a selective inhibitor of the BET family of epigenetic transcriptional regulators. NUV-868 specifically inhibits the protein BRD4, a key member of the BET family that epigenetically regulates proteins that control tumor growth and differentiation. Notably, BET proteins are believed to be important regulators of the oncogene c-myc. Because c-myc has been implicated as a driver of tumor growth in up to 70% of cancers, BET inhibitors are considered to be a potentially important approach to inhibiting this oncogene, which has been difficult to generate therapeutic drugs against. We have designed NUV-868 to have properties that avoid the therapeutic limiting toxicities of BRD4 inhibitors currently in development focused on optimizing BD2 versus BD1 selectivity. Some first-generation BET inhibitors inhibit BD2 only 1.4-1.5 times better than they inhibit BD1. These first-generation BET inhibitors have been observed to have significant toxicities, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and bone marrow. NUV-868 inhibits the BD2 subdomain of BRD4 almost 1,500 times more potently than it does the BD1 subdomain, which we believe will improve its tolerability. We plan to submit an IND for NUV-868 in the second half of 2021 and initiate Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and/or potentially c-myc driven solid tumors in the first half of 2022. 
 
3 


 We are also developing several other therapeutic candidates, including NUV-569, a differentiated selective inhibitor of the Wee1 kinase, an important regulator of DNA damage repair. Wee1 is responsible for controlling the cellular checkpoint that can signal to a dividing cell to pause replication while damaged DNA is repaired. Inhibition of this kinase can cause a tumor cell to divide before it has finished repairing its DNA, causing catastrophic DNA damage and programmed cell death. We have designed NUV-569 to avoid off-target effects by improving its kinase selectivity, which we believe could increase its therapeutic window. Because Wee1 inhibitors synergize with DNA-damaging therapies like radiation and certain types of chemotherapy to increase anti-tumor activity. Wee1 inhibitors like NUV-569 may have wide applicability in treating many different types of cancer. We intend to submit an IND for NUV-569 in the first half of 2022 and initiate Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with pancreatic cancer and/or other solid tumors in the second half of 2022. 
 Our DDC platform is a novel therapeutic approach within the drug-conjugate class of anti-cancer therapies with parallels to Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs). ADCs have been effective treatments in oncology, with ten drugs approved by the FDA and an estimated $11.0 billion in worldwide sales expected in 2023. We believe our DDC candidates could expand the therapeutic potential for the drug-conjugate class due to inherently differentiated properties versus ADCs, including a simpler manufacturing process, the potential to cross the cell membrane and recognize intracellular targets, and the potential for oral dosing. 
 Our DDC platform is designed to selectively deliver potent targeted therapeutics to cancer cells to exert greater toxicity against these target cells than against healthy non-target tissues. We have accomplished this by synthetically fusing a proven anti-cancer small molecule drug to a second small molecule that selectively binds distinct receptors that are preferentially expressed in cancer cells. These tissue-specific receptors create a sink that not only may concentrate the targeted drug in cancer cells but may also magnify the effects of the drug in those cells, while preventing similar effects in cells that do not express the targeted receptor. This should allow our DDC candidates to avoid some of the adverse effects commonly seen with many cancer drugs, such as bone marrow suppression and GI toxicity. Because this program at its core fuses the active sites of two or more small molecules to each other to generate a new small molecule with improved activity and targeted specificity, they are called DDCs. 
 Our first DDC program is focused on targeting an inhibitor of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) to androgen receptor, or AR-expressing cancer cells. AR expression is significantly higher in prostate cancer cells than in the GI tract and bone marrow, which are the major sites of current commercial PARP inhibitor toxicities. By fusing a PARP inhibitor to an AR-targeting drug, we believe we may be able to achieve better on-target anti-cancer effects and lower off-target adverse effects than commercially available non-specific and non-targeted agents. We believe such a targeted approach to prostate cancer could potentially be broadly applicable, ranging from the treatment of heavily pretreated metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer to the treatment of newly diagnosed early prostate cancer. The ability of our PARP-AR DDC to kill prostate cancer cells resistant to current therapies suggests that this therapeutic candidate could play a role in advanced stage prostate cancer, particularly in the Xtandi and Zytiga® resistant setting. In the early cancer setting, we believe that PARP-AR DDCs could be a potential pharmacological alternative to surgical prostatectomy and ablative radiation, procedures that often result in comorbidities due to damage to the prostate and surrounding nerve and vascular structures. 
 Our second DDC program is focused on targeting a PARP inhibitor to ER-expressing cancer cells. We believe we may be able to achieve better on-target anti-cancer effects by delivering a PARP inhibitor to ER-expressing breast and ovarian cancers and avoid adverse effects commonly seen with non-specific, non- targeted PARP inhibitors including bone marrow and gastrointestinal toxicity. Similar to our PARP-AR DDC program, we believe that our PARP-ER DDC could be broadly applicable, ranging from treatment of advanced stage to early stage breast and ovarian cancers. We intend to nominate clinical development candidates in the second half of 2022. 
 
4 


 Our adenosine receptor program is focused on targeting the A2a adenosine receptor, an important target in immune-oncology. Accumulation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment may be a critical factor in limiting the activity of currently available immuno-oncology drugs, including anti-PD(L)1 drugs and anti-cancer chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Thus, targeting the adenosine receptor may overcome this blockade, leading to improved anti-cancer activity in tumors which are resistant to immuno-oncology drugs and adoptive T cell therapies. 
 We retain worldwide rights to all the products in our pipeline. We have a broad intellectual property portfolio comprised of more than 15 pending U.S. patent applications, over 15 pending PCT patent applications, over 40 pending foreign patent applications and two issued US patents, with expected expirations, excluding any patent term extensions, between 2038 and 2041. 
 Our Team 
 Our Chief Executive Officer, David Hung, M.D., has over 15 years of experience as a leader in the biopharmaceutical industry. Dr. Hung founded Medivation in 2003, raised a total of $433.0 million in public offerings over the life of the company and, in 2016, sold Medivation to Pfizer for $14.3 billion, one of the largest biopharma sales ever by a founding Chief Executive Officer. At Medivation, Dr. Hung identified, in-licensed and led bench-to-bedside development of enzalutamide (marketed as Xtandi) for advanced prostate cancer. Xtandi was taken from first in vitro laboratory experiment to FDA approval in seven years, one of the fastest development timelines in pharmaceutical history. Xtandi, approved in 60+ countries, reached blockbuster drug status exceeding $2.0 billion in global annual sales in 2015 and generated $3.7 billion in sales in 2019. Medivation also licensed the PARP inhibitor talazoparib from BioMarin in 2015, and Dr. Hung led its Phase 3 clinical development. In 2018, talazoparib received FDA approval, and it is now marketed as Talzenna for the treatment of breast cancer. Prior to Medivation, Dr. Hung was founder and Chief Executive Officer of Pro Duct Health, a startup company focused on the early detection of breast cancer. Under Dr. Hungs stewardship, Pro Duct Health raised a total of $22.0 million in venture financing. Three years after its first private financing, Pro Duct Healths lead product in breast cancer (which Dr. Hung himself invented) received FDA clearance, and Pro Duct Health was then acquired for $168.0 million by Cytyc Corporation. 
 Our management team has broad expertise and a successful track record of discovering and developing new medicines. Our Chief Medical Officer, Sergey Yurasov, M.D., Ph.D., previously held positions at F. Hoffmann La-Roche (Roche), Eli Lilly and Company (Eli Lilly), Clovis Oncology Inc. and Immune Design Corp. At Eli Lilly, he was a leading physician for the FDA filing of Cyramza® for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and, at Clovis Oncology, he led a clinical development group during the FDA filing of Rubraca for patients with ovarian cancer. He was most recently Chief Medical Officer at Immune Design, a publicly traded company acquired by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) in 2019, where he oversaw clinical and regulatory development of several oncology drug candidates. Our Chief Scientific Officer, Gary Hattersley, Ph.D., was previously at Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Radius Health. At Radius Health, he was a founding scientist and supported the development and subsequent FDA filing of Tymlos® for patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture and the development of several oncology drug candidates. 
 We raised $275.0 million through a Series A preferred stock financing with leading firms that share our vision of delivering new therapies to cancer patients, including, Aisling Capital, Baupost Group, Boxer Capital, Citadel, EcoR1, Fidelity, Omega Funds, Perceptive Advisors, Redmile Group and others. 
 Strategy 
 We strive to deliver meaningful benefit to patients with serious unmet medical needs in oncology by developing potentially breakthrough therapies. The core elements of our strategy include: 

 | Rapidly advance the development of our lead product candidate, NUV-422, our selective CDK2/4/6 inhibitor, toward regulatory approval for the treatment of four of the greatest unmet needs in oncology. We have advanced NUV-422 through preclinical studies that have informed a robust clinical development plan to treat (1) CDK2-driven recurrent high-grade gliomas, including GBM. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to NUV-422 for the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. Considering NUV-422s ability to penetrate into the brain, we plan to investigate its anti-tumor activity in (2) breast and potentially other cancer patients with brain metastases, where FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown limited efficacy. We are also advancing NUV-422 to treat patients with (3) ER+ mBC where CDK4/6 inhibitors have been successful but CDK2-driven resistance to therapy can develop. Furthermore, based upon literature that suggests an important role for CDK2/4/6 in driving prostate cancer, we also intend to develop NUV-422 in (4) mCRPC. We began dosing high-grade glioma patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with NUV-422 in December 2020, leveraging a potentially accelerated approval pathway based on its potential to demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in a serious or life-threatening condition for which there are unmet medical needs. We also intend to initiate additional clinical trials in patients with brain metastases, ER+ mBC and mCRPC.

 | Advance candidates from our DDC platform to expand our oncology-focused pipeline. We are developing a pipeline of new chemical entities that leverage the tissue-specific targeting capabilities of AR and ER small molecule binders fused to PARP inhibitors. We intend to nominate clinical development candidates in the second half of 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advance our deep oncology pipeline of novel therapeutic candidates developed against clinically validated targets. We have designed our candidates with optimized properties including their ability to avoid specific adverse effects of competitive compounds or enhance their anti-tumor potential by targeting additional drivers of tumor resistance. Our early stage pipeline currently includes NUV-868 targeting BET and NUV-569 targeting Wee1. Overall, in addition to the IND already submitted and accepted for NUV-422, we anticipate submitting up to an additional five IND applications to the FDA over the next six years and expect to seek expedited regulatory pathways in multiple programs, such as through Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to leverage our deep insights in medicinal chemistry to pursue innovative clinical candidates. We have established medicinal chemistry capabilities that have enabled us to rapidly pursue our current pipeline and platform. We intend to leverage these capabilities to pursue both new and validated targets in patients with serious unmet medical needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize value of our product candidate pipeline. We currently own the exclusive worldwide development and commercial rights to each of our product candidates. We intend to evaluate collaborations that could maximize the value of our product candidate pipeline, either through the evaluation of our product candidates in combination with compounds owned by third parties or through geographic collaborations outside of the U.S. that allow us to leverage the existing infrastructure of other companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Build a fully integrated global oncology company. We intend to continue building a fully integrated research, development and commercialization focused company. Our track record of success underscores our proven expertise in discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines to patients. If our therapeutic candidates are approved, we intend to establish a focused commercial infrastructure and selectively expand our global commercial capabilities.

Programs 
 Overview of NUV-422: CDK2/4/6 Inhibitor Program 
 Our lead product candidate, NUV-422, is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor targeting CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6. These are members of the CDK family of proteins that play a critical role in the regulation of tumor growth. Inhibition of cell-cycle kinases CDK4 and CDK6 results in significant therapeutic effect in patients with advanced hormone ER+ mBC, and these results have led to the approvals of three first-generation CDK inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib. Although these advancements have greatly expanded the treatment options for breast cancer patients, insensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition has been found in some patients with primary or acquired resistance. As a result, therapeutic resistance and disease progression continue to limit the efficacy and duration of clinical benefit of these therapies. One known mechanism by which some breast cancer patients become resistant to first-generation CDK inhibitors is through CDK2 signaling, which allows cancer cells to bypass CDK4/6 inhibition. Beyond breast cancer, CDK2 activation is known to drive tumorigenesis in multiple solid tumors including brain cancer and prostate cancer, and increased CDK2 activity is associated with lower overall patient survival. NUV-422 selectively inhibits CDK4/6, similar to the approved CDK4/6 inhibitors, but also potently inhibits CDK2. Since its initial discovery in our chemistry program, we have rapidly advanced NUV-422 through preclinical studies that have informed a robust clinical development plan focused on these areas of unmet medical need: (1) high-grade gliomas, including GBM; (2) breast cancer with brain metastases (BCBM); (3) ER+ mBC; and (4) mCRPC. We began dosing patients with high-grade gliomas in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NUV-422 in December 2020, with additional clinical trials in BCBM, ER+ mBC and mCRPC expected to follow soon thereafter.

 CDK2 as a novel mechanism of resistance and oncogenic driver in multiple cancers 
 The CDK family of proteins regulates cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in treatments using CDK inhibitors have focused on inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6, but preclinical studies and clinical trials suggest CDK2 may play an important role as a driver of tumor cell growth as the underlying mechanism of both primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. CDK2 is an essential regulator of the cell division cycle and multiple events within the cell cycle, including centrosome duplication, DNA synthesis and G1-to-S-phase transition. CDK2 can bind both cyclin E and cyclin A, which play roles in the cell cycle. Cyclin D normally binds CDK4/6 and is thus a target of CDK4/6 inhibitors, but in the absence of CDK4/6, cyclin D can activate CDK2, which subsequently drives cell cycle progression. 
 We believe that CDK2 plays a key role in patients who either do not respond to current therapies or develop primary or secondary resistance to ongoing treatment. We and others have shown that CDK2 function can drive hyperproliferation in multiple cancers, including in gliomas, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The CDK2 expression level is elevated in multiple patient tumor tissues, and increased CDK2 expression correlates with a worse survival outcome (Tadasse, et al 2020, Wang et al 2016). It was also recently shown that nearly 70% of high-grade glioma patients carry a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, which encodes for p14 and p16, which are tumor suppressors that inhibit CDK4/6 directly and CDK2 through p21 (Reinhardt, et al 2018, Verhaak, et al 2010). These results, some of which are depicted in the diagram and graphs below, suggest that targeting CDK2 in these cancers may lead to a blockade of an important aberrant mechanism of tumor growth and resistance to therapy leading to an improvement of clinical outcomes.

 CDKN2A-DELETION DRIVES PRIMARY HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS

----+------------------

 In addition to primary resistance and de novo tumorigenesis, there are preclinical and clinical data suggesting that CDK2 may be involved in acquired resistance to cancer therapy. Metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled in the PALOMA-3 study who did not benefit from palbociclib therapy demonstrated overexpression of c-myc and cyclin E1 (Turner et al 2018). Since c-myc acts upstream to activate CDK2 and cyclin E1 binds CDK2 to drive the cell cycle, these results suggest CDK2 may be responsible for tumor resistance to palbociclib treatment. Taken together, these preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that CDK2 plays a unique role in promoting tumor growth in multiple types of cancer and that targeting CDK2 in addition to CDK4/6 may help patients overcome the CDK2-mediated resistance to approved therapies, including palbociclib and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. 
 CDK2 DRIVES RESISTANCE TO CDK4/6 INHIBITORS

 Limitations of Other CDK Inhibitors 
 While CDK4/6 inhibitors demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer including an improvement in overall survival, emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that targeting CDK2 in addition to CDK4/6 may provide further benefit to cancer patients whose tumors may be driven by CDK2. These may include breast cancer that does not benefit from treatment with approved CDK4/6 inhibitors and other cancers wherein CDK2 dysregulation may contribute to tumor growth and worse clinical outcomes. It has been reported that of the three FDA approved CDK4/6 inhibitors (ribociclib, palbociclib, abemaciclib), only abemaciclib demonstrated some anti-CDK2 activity, albeit extremely weak activity, in the hundreds of nanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) range (Chen, et al, 2016). The IC50 is a measure of how much of a particular drug or other substance (inhibitor) is required for 50% inhibition of a specific biological or biochemical function, and IC50 values in the hundreds of nanomolar range are considered a sign of relatively weak inhibition. As evidenced by the recently reported divergent outcomes in the breast cancer adjuvant trials of palbociclib (PALLAS and PENELOPE-B studies) and abemaciclib (MonarchE study), patients who received treatment with abemaciclib experienced significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival and distant relapse-free survival (Johnston, et al, 2020), while no such effect was reported for patients in palbociclib trials (Mayer, et al 2020). Moreover, only abemaciclib received approval by the FDA as monotherapy for breast cancer patients, while ribociclib and palbociclib are only approved in combination with hormonal therapy, suggesting a potential benefit of even weak CDK2 inhibition in addition to CDK4/6 inhibition. 
 We and others have shown that it is critical to target CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, while sparing CDK1, which is a ubiquitously expressed CDK, the inhibition of which is known to cause severe toxicities in animal models and in patients. Dinaciclib is a potent inhibitor of CDK1 in addition to CDK2 with IC50 for both in the low nanomolar range, indicating strong inhibition. When tested as a once weekly intravenous infusion in a clinical trial (Nemunaitis, et al 2013), despite early signs of anti-tumor activity, 60% of patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, liver enzyme elevation, hyperbilirubinemia and hematological adverse events (neutropenia, anemia). Consequently, clinical development of dinaciclib has been discontinued. 
 To our knowledge, PF-06873600 is the only other CDK2/4/6 inhibitor in clinical development currently, and while it inhibits CDK2/4/6, it also strongly inhibits CDK1 with an IC50 in the single-digit nanomolar range, which could result in a poor therapeutic index. We believe that sparing CDK1 inhibition is critical to developing a safe and efficacious next-generation CDK inhibitor drug. 
 NUV-422 Differentiation 
 NUV-422 is a next-generation CDK inhibitor discovered in our chemistry program, which potently inhibits CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, while sparing CDK1 as shown in the table below. NUV-422 is approximately equal to approved drugs ribociclib, palbociclib and abemaciclib in its ability to inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, but it additionally inhibits CDK2, like PF-06873600. But importantly, unlike PF-06873600, NUV-422 does not potently inhibit CDK1, demonstrating a 10 fold lower IC50 for CDK1 than CDK2, CDK4 or CDK6.We believe this positions NUV-422 as a promising next-generation CDK inhibitor with superior CDK2/4/6 vs CDK1 selectivity. In preclinical studies, we have shown that NUV-422 exhibits good drug-like properties, with oral bioavailability, suitable pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism profiles, and a nonclinical safety profile consistent with the class of CDK4/6 inhibitors, as well as a scalable manufacturing process. We have shown that NUV-422 demonstrates strong anti-proliferative activity across multiple human cancer cells.

Our Current Opportunities for NUV-422
Overview of Recurrent or Refractory High-Grade Gliomas 
 Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the U.S. and accounts for nearly one in four deaths. Primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) remain among the most difficult to treat, with a 5-year overall survival of approximately 35%. Gliomas represent 75% of malignant primary brain tumors and GBM accounts for over half of all gliomas. Compared to other areas of oncology, relatively few advances have been made in the treatment of brain cancers. Temozolomide (TMZ) is commonly used in front-line settings in combination with radiation, and it was first approved more than fifteen years ago in 2005. Bevacizumab approval soon followed in 2009 for recurrent GBM, but its use remains controversial due to conflicting clinical trial results. Consequently, our initial proposed indication, recurrent or refractory high-grade gliomas, remains a significant unmet medical need with the first de facto option for recurrent GBM patients being clinical trials. Based on the preclinical data we have generated and clinical data others have generated, including patient biopsy, genetic sequencing and survival data, there is a strong biological rationale for targeting CDK2 in gliomas, including GBM. Coupled with preclinical data demonstrating preferential accumulation of NUV-422 in the brain without evidence of CNS toxicity, we believe that NUV-422 has the potential to bring significant clinical benefit to high-grade glioma patients. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to NUV-422 for the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. 
Clinical Rationale for Targeting CDK2/4/6 in Gliomas 
 There is strong evidence suggesting CDK inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy in gliomas. It was recently reported that CDKN2A deletion occurs in nearly 70% of high-grade gliomas (Reinhardt, et al 2018, Verhaak, et al 2010). Importantly CDKN2A deletion was identified as an independent prognostic factor of poor outcomes including shorter overall survival (Korshunov, et al 2019, Appay, et al 2020). A phase 2 study of abemaciclib in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients showed that a progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer with abemaciclib when compared to the temozolomide containing control arm. However, since abemaciclib demonstrated some anti-CDK2 activity, and there was no evidence of a positive treatment and CDK4 biomarker interaction, CDK2 activity may be an important driver of tumor glioblastoma growth. Since CDKN2A encodes for proteins whose functions are to inhibit CDK2 and CDK4/6, a drug that can inhibit all three of these CDKs may be efficacious in these patients. These results provide strong support for developing NUV-422 for glioma patients.

 Preclinical Data 
 The in vitro anti-proliferative activity of NUV-422 was evaluated in six glioma cell lines, five of which have known CDKN2A deletions. Treatment with NUV-422 resulted in dose-dependent growth inhibition of all six glioma cell lines, with mean absolute IC50 values in the nanomolar range. 
 The in vivo antitumor activity of NUV-422 and TMZ was evaluated in a cell line-derived xenograft model, which harbors a CDKN2A deletion, implanted subcutaneously in the flank of immunocompromised mice. NUV-422 was administered orally once daily (QD) at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg and orally once every other day (QOD) at 60 mg/kg. NUV-422 treatment at all doses resulted in reduced tumor volume (p < 0.0001) of tumors compared to the vehicle-treated group. In contrast, SOC TMZ had no significant effect on tumor growth compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results are illustrated in the following chart.

Following a single 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg oral dose of NUV-422 in rats, the brain-to-plasma concentration ratios at six hours post-dose ranged from 11 to 12. These data, set forth in the following table, demonstrate high blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of NUV-422.HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF NUV-422 IN THE BRAIN

 Clinical Development Plan for NUV-422 in Brain Tumors 
 We have successfully completed IND-enabling studies of NUV-422, our lead product candidate. The molecule has favorable pharmacological properties with a wide therapeutic index and has demonstrated a consistent nonclinical safety profile supportive of advancement into clinical trials. Most importantly, NUV-422 is unique among CDK inhibitors in that it is much more BBB penetrant and maintains a longer half-life in the brain than in the plasma: approximately 12 times the exposure in the brain compared to the plasma. We believe these characteristics will allow NUV-422 to more potently engage the intended targets in brain tumors compared to other CDK inhibitors that have been tested in brain tumors to date. 
 Our IND for NUV-422 was accepted by the FDA, and we began dosing adult patients with recurrent or refractory high-grade gliomas in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in December 2020. The Phase 1 part of our clinical trial is being conducted as a dose escalation study in an unselected all comer population with recurrent high-grade gliomas, including GBM, with primary objectives to evaluate safety and tolerability, as well as to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose based on the tolerability profile and pharmacokinetic properties of NUV-422. We intend to continue with the Phase 2 dose expansion part of the trial initially focusing on high-grade gliomas, including GBM, with CDKN2A deletion to evaluate overall response rate, duration of response and survival. While we hypothesize that these patients are most likely to experience clinical benefit from NUV-422 dosing, the trial may be amended to include patients irrespective of their CDKN2A status since activity of NUV-422 is not limited to CDK2, and benefit may be observed in other patients. We anticipate reporting data from the Phase 1 portion of this trial in 2022. This trial design is depicted below. 
 NUV-422-02: SEAMLESS PHASE 1/2 TRIAL DESIGN 
 


Overview of Metastatic Breast Cancer 
 Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, and the second most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 1.8 million new diagnoses per year. In the U.S., breast cancer has the highest prevalence among all cancers. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program at National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2020, there will be 276,000 new cases of breast cancer in the U.S. alone, and more than 40,000 deaths. Treatment options for breast cancer depend on many factors, including the stage of cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease which is grouped into several clinical subtypes based on the expression of three proteins: ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2. Both ER and PR are hormone receptors, and tumors that express either of these receptors are referred to as hormone receptor-positive. The ACS estimates that approximately 75-80% of all breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER+) highlighting the central role of ER signaling in driving a large majority of breast cancer. Although early-stage non-metastatic disease is curable in approximately 70-80% of patients, advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies (Harbeck, et al 2019). Advanced breast cancer comprises inoperable locally advanced breast cancer, which has not spread to distant organs, and metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer; common sites of spread are bone, lungs, liver and brain. Currently, it is a treatable but virtually incurable disease, with metastases including to the brain being the cause of death in almost all patients, and a median overall survival of two to three years. Patients with metastatic breast cancer receive treatments that aim to relieve their symptoms and to prolong quality-adjusted life expectancy. 
 
12 


 For patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer, endocrine therapy has been the backbone of treatment with a focus on developing a new generation of selective ER modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs) due to emerging resistance to approved drugs. This resistance to endocrine treatment is due to multiple mechanisms, including changes in ER signaling and activation of other molecular pathways, such as CDK, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and others (McAndrew & Finn, 2020). Recently, several agents targeting these mechanisms have been approved by the FDA: mTOR inhibitor everolimus (2012), followed by the approval of 3 CDK 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib [2015], ribociclib [2018] and abemaciclib [2018]), and more recently the PI3-K inhibitor alpelisib for a subgroup of patients with PI3K alterations (2019). For a select group of patients with homologous recombination-deficient (HR-D) breast cancer, talazoparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in 2018. All three approved CDK4/6 inhibitorspalbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclibare used in metastatic settings, yet nearly half of patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer may not respond to first line of treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with hormonal therapy, and many eventually experience progression of cancer. 
 Clinical Rationale for Targeting CDK2/4/6 in Breast Cancer Patients with Brain Metastases and Other Tumors. 
 It is estimated that at least 15% and as high as 50% of breast cancer patients will develop brain metastases during the course of their disease (Leone et al 2019). Patients with brain metastasis have a poor prognosis with short overall survival and low quality of life. The prevalence of BCBM is increasing as treatment of primary cancers and imaging techniques improve. In addition, the brain is a sanctuary site for breast cancer cells treated with drugs that have poor penetration into CNS. Thus, although a multitude of systemic treatment options exist for extracranial breast metastases, brain metastases continue to pose treatment challenges in clinical practice. For ER+ mBC patients, though recent Phase 3 trials demonstrated a PFS and even an overall survival benefit for CDK4/6 inhibitors in the first or second-line setting, there is limited evidence to inform their CNS-specific activity (Nguyen, et al 2019). Many studies included patients with stable and treated brain metastases or excluded patients with brain metastasis altogether, thus, the potential utility of CDK4/6 inhibitors for the prevention of CNS metastases remains unknown. A study of abemaciclib in BCBM patients demonstrated a slightly over 20% intracranial and extracranial clinical benefit with 5% intracranial response rate (Tolaney et al 2019). While brain exposure was favorable in some of the patients, the overall low response rate in and outside the brain demonstrated that inhibition of just CDK4/6 may not be enough for substantial control of the disease in this patient population. In addition, analyses of breast cancer metastases identified CDKN2A/p16 as a gene potentially associated with development of brain metastases. Patients with a higher p16 score had higher risk of brain metastases and worse overall survival (Furet, et al., 2017). Thus, targeting CDK2 in addition to CDK4/6 may present an important therapeutic strategy in ER+ mBC. In addition, up to 50% of patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer develop brain metastases, and a combination strategy of CDK2/4/6 inhibition with HER2 targeted therapy may warrant further investigation. 
 Overall, brain metastases develop in nearly 30% of patients with solid tumors. Cancers of the lung, breast and skin (melanoma) most frequently develop brain metastases and account for 6780% of patients. Brain metastases from solid extracranial tumors represent an unmet need of increasing relevance as their incidence is rising considerably and is now estimated to be approximately 10 times higher than for primary malignant brain

  tumors. Thus, we may opt to study the effect of NUV-422 on brain metastases in patients whose primary tumor location is other than breast (e.g., lung, skin, and/or gastrointestinal tract). 
 Clinical Rationale for Targeting CDK2/4/6 in ER+ mBC 
 It was recently reported in the PALOMA-3 trial of ER+ mBC patients that cyclin E1 overexpression is a potential resistance mechanism to palbociclib (Turner, et al 2019). Palbociclib efficacy was approximately halved in patients with high cyclin E1 expression compared to patients with low cyclin E1 expression (median PFS of 7.6 vs 14.1 months, respectively). Since Cyclin E is a known binding partner to CDK2 leading to cell cycle progression, these results reinforce that CDK2 is a key bypass kinase of CDK4/6 inhibition that may be responsible for driving resistance to palbociclib. 
 Preclinical Data and Development Plan for NUV-422


 | The in vitro anti-proliferative activity of NUV-422 was evaluated in nine cell lines representing four different tumor types that frequently metastasize to the brain. As illustrated in the graph below, treatment with NUV-422 resulted in growth inhibition of all nine cell lines, with mean absolute IC50 values in the less than 200 nanomolar range.

 BEYOND PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS, ADDITIONAL NUV-422 OPPORTUNITIES IN TUMORS WHICH COMMONLY METASTASIZE TO BRAIN 
 


The in vivo antitumor activity of NUV-422 alone and in combination with fulvestrant, an approved anti-estrogen breast cancer drug, was evaluated in a cell line-derived xenograft model, implanted subcutaneously in the flank of immunocompromised mice. NUV-422 was administered orally QD at 30 mg/kg. NUV-422 treatment resulted in reduced tumor volume compared to the vehicle-treated group. While fulvestrant alone had a significant effect on tumor volume, the combination of NUV-422 and fulvestrant results in an even greater decrease in tumor volume. These results are illustrated in the graph below.

 NUV-422 IS SUPERIOR TO FULVESTRANT IN XENOGRAFT MODEL OF ER+ METASTATIC BREAST CANCER 
 


We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial of NUV-422 in BCBM patients in first half of 2022 and to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial of NUV-422 in ER+ mBC in second half of 2022. 
 Clinical Rationale for Targeting CDK2/4/6 in mCRPC. 
 The role of CDK2 as a crucial factor in development of metastases in patients with prostate cancer has been supported by an extensive analysis of patient gene sequencing data and clinical outcomes (Yin, et al 2018). This analysis identified CDK2 and CDKN2C as one of the most important genes in transcriptional dysregulation in prostate cancer when expression of CDK2 was significantly associated with recurrence of prostate cancer (p = 0.00793). The importance of CDK2 in cancer growth is further supported by knockout experiments suggesting that CDK2 is critical to the cell invasion. While a clinical trial of abemaciclib in prostate cancer is ongoing, a randomized study of palbociclib with abiraterone in mCRPC patients demonstrated that addition of this CDK4/6 inhibitor to AR-targeting therapy did not improve prostate specific antigen endpoints or PFS in this population (Palmbos, et al 2020). Thus, targeting CDK2 in combination with hormonal therapy may be able to address an important unmet medical need in mCRPC patients who progress on current SOC therapy. 
Preclinical Data 
 The in vivo antitumor activity of NUV-422 alone and in combination with enzalutamide (Xtandi), an approved prostate cancer drug, was evaluated in a patient-derived xenograft model, implanted subcutaneously in the flank of immunocompromised mice. NUV-422 was administered orally QD at 30 mg/kg. Treatment with NUV-422 alone resulted in reduced tumor volume compared to the vehicle-treated group. As illustrated in the graph below, while enzalutamide alone had very little effect on reducing tumor volume, the combination of NUV-422 and enzalutamide resulted in an enhanced antitumor effect, where all of the treated animals had marked tumor regression.

 DEEP TUMOR REDUCTIONS OBSERVED IN ENZALUTAMIDE-RESISTANT PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT PROSTATE MODEL 
 


Overview of Our DDC Technology Platform 
 The foundations of our DDCs are built by employing tissue-targeting small molecules fused to anti-cancer warheads of existing drugs with well-understood mechanisms of action. For example, our current lead PARP-AR DDC, NUV-1156, is composed of the AR binder Xtandi (enzalutamide) fused to the warhead of the PARP inhibitor Lynparza® (olaparib) to address advanced stage prostate cancers with the potential to move into earlier lines typically treated with surgical prostatectomy. Our current lead PARP-ER DDC, NUV-1176, is composed of a PARP inhibitor warhead that is fused to the binding domain of an ER-targeting small molecule to address ER+ breast and ovarian cancer. In preclinical models, NUV-1156 and NUV-1176 potently kill tumor cell lines without killing healthy cells in the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. NUV-1156 and NUV-1176 are currently our lead DDCs from our DDC platform in preclinical development, and we intend to nominate our first clinical development candidate from our DDC platform in the second half of 2022. 
Traditional Cancer Therapeutics 
 Cancer treatment has traditionally included chemotherapy, radiation, surgery or a combination of these approaches. Over the last twenty years, new paradigms of cancer research and treatment have emerged to address the limitations of existing treatments. Monoclonal antibodies, or proteins that bind to antigen targets on tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth, represent one of the most successful approaches. More recently, engineered versions of monoclonal antibody-based therapies have emerged, including ADCs and bispecific antibodies, which collectively aim to exert the tumor-specific power of monoclonal antibodies to drive a larger clinical impact than conventional approaches. 
 ADCs 
 ADCs exert their antitumor activity by using monoclonal antibodies to deliver potent cytotoxins directly to tumors. ADCs have three primary components: (1) a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an antigen on the tumor and is responsible for directing the therapy to the tumor; (2) a cytotoxic molecule that causes cell death, typically by interrupting with a critical cell function such as replication; and (3) a linker that attaches the cytotoxin to the antibody. The two main attributes of ADC therapeutics are: 
 

 | Targeting Only Diseased Tissue. ADCs are designed with a monoclonal antibody that binds to antigen targets that are preferably expressed on the outside of tumor cells and not on healthy tissues.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16 


 
 | Increased Therapeutic Window. The cytotoxin payload of the ADC attached to the targeting monoclonal antibody is directed to specific cancer epitopes on the cell surface, allowing an improved therapeutic index by delivering the cytotoxin to the cancer more than non-target tissues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of these two main attributes, ADCs can offer greater antitumor potency while still maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Despite these benefits, limitations remain, including: 
 

 | Intravenous Delivery. ADCs are administered intravenously into the systemic circulation where they home to tumors. While the cytotoxic payload is designed to only cleave when internalized by the targeted tumor cell, challenges with linker chemistry can result in instability and cause the cytotoxic payload to be released within circulation, causing systemic toxicities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Inability to Reach Intracellular Targets. Monoclonal antibodies are not capable of penetrating the cell membrane due to their size and are limited to targeting antigens that are present on the surface of a tumor cell.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Complex Manufacturing. ADCs are complex biologics that require the refinement of several properties in tandem and are expensive to manufacture. They often present significant manufacturing challenges, particularly at a large scale, and generally have a lower gross margin than a small molecule.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our SolutionDDCs 
 Our DDC platform has generated orally bioavailable small molecules that fuse the binding domains of two different drugs to target two different targets, simultaneously. Our platform leverages our drug discovery and chemistry expertise to find the minimum target binding sites of drug X and drug Y and fuse them together, while maintaining activity. Our DDCs are designed to selectively bind to intracellular targets that are expressed more highly in specific target tissues and to potently deliver anti-cancer warheads to these target tissues. The figure below depicts our DDC approach. 
 DRUG-DRUG CONJUGATES ARE DESIGNED TO BIND TWO DIFFERENT TARGETS SIMULTANEOUSLY 
 


Key benefits of our DDCs include: 
 

 | Small molecules that are potentially orally bioavailable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to bind to intracellular as well as surface cell membrane targets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Straightforward small molecule manufacturing and attractive gross margins.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our DDC technology will be broadly applicable and can be replicated across many other existing therapies to transform the SOC across multiple indications for oncology. 
 NUV-1156: Targeting AR and PARP for Prostate Cancer 
 NUV-1156, our current lead PARP-AR DDC, is an oral small molecule that is composed of a PARP inhibitor warhead that is fused to the binding domain of an AR-targeting small molecule. In preclinical models, NUV-1156 demonstrated the ability to kill tumor cells associated with high AR-expression, sparing healthy cells in bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract that do not have high levels of AR expression. 
 
17 


 We are exploring the use of NUV-1156 in prostate cancer, initially focused on mCRPC where there is an urgent unmet medical need. The ability of our PARP-AR DDC to kill prostate cancer cells resistant to current therapies suggests that this drug could play a role in advanced stage prostate cancer, particularly in the Xtandi and Zytiga resistant setting. 
 Additionally, we believe PARP-AR DDCs could play a role in early-stage prostate cancer where the SOC care for newly diagnosed, early-stage patients is radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy which often results in serious side effects, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and fecal incontinence. We believe a PARP-AR DDC could potentially allow early-stage patients to avoid surgical radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, which we believe could be a major transformation for the treatment of prostate cancer. 
 We are currently in preclinical development and intend to nominate our first lead clinical development candidate in the second half of 2022. 
 NUV-1156 Drug Design and Mechanism of Action 
 Our PARP-AR DDCs kill cells via an AR-targeted mechanism. NUV-1156 is comprised of the warhead from the PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib) which is fused to an AR-binding domain of Xtandi (enzalutamide). We believe this drug design will potentially allow for a PARP inhibitor to be potently delivered to high AR-expressing tumors, like prostate cancer, while avoiding the off-target toxicities associated with other PARP inhibitors, namely toxicity in the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract, which are low AR-expressing tissues. The figure below depicts the components of NUV-1156.
NUV-1156 IS A DDC THAT TARGETS AR AND PARP 
 


PARP Inhibitor Overview 
 Mechanisms of Action 
 The rapid cell division and attendant required DNA replication seen in cancers causes an increase in single stranded DNA breaks. PARP is the most abundant DNA repair enzyme in the nucleus. Because cancers have an increase in DNA breaks related to their rapid division, their DNA breaks must be repaired by PARP if the cancers are to be able to faithfully replicate their DNA. Furthermore, approximately one-third of tumors have intrinsic DNA repair defects, such as BRCA-mutations and other HR-D. Tumors with HR-D struggle to repair and faithfully replicate DNA. When HR-D is combined with PARP inhibition, DNA repair is so compromised that cancer cells can no longer survive. This is the fundamental reason that all current commercially available PARP inhibitors have superior outcomes in HR-D vs. homologous recombination proficient (HR-P) cancers. This mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors has been shown to further enhance the effects of DNA-damaging anti-cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation. 
 Existing PARP Inhibitors and Our Opportunity 
 PARP inhibitors Lynparza (olaparib), Rubraca (rucaparib camsylate), Zejula (niraparib) and Talzenna (talazoparib tosylate) have been approved by the FDA for multiple oncology indications, including ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Sales of these FDA-approved PARP inhibitors were approximately $1.7 billion in 2019 and are forecasted to be over $7.0 billion in 2025, with Lynparza (olaparib) accounting for $1.2 billion and over $4.0 billion in the 2019 and 2025 totals, respectively. 
 
18 


 Despite the commercial success of PARP inhibitors, broader adoption is limited by their high rates of GI and bone marrow toxicity which is largely a result of off-target cell killing. Adverse grade 3-4 events from this class of drugs include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and alopecia. Other common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and decreased appetite. We believe a DDC that fuses the warhead of a PARP inhibitor to an AR-binding domain of Xtandi (enzalutamide) will allow us to take advantage of the powerful and proven selectivity of AR therapy in AR-driven tumors by possibly minimizing the toxicities associated with PARP inhibitors in low AR-expressing cells in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and broadening the tumor types (both HR-D and HR-P) in which this approach could be effective. 
 AR Selectively Expressed in AR-Specific Tissue 
 The growth and survival of prostate cancer cells depends heavily on the AR. Testosterone fuels prostate cancer cell growth by using the binding of androgens to ARs to trigger abnormal cell growth and tumor progression. In men, AR protein expression is limited primarily to the sex organs, with medium to high AR expression levels seen across the testis, prostate, epididymis and seminal vesicle tissues. In contrast, AR expression is either low or not detected in the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, two organs strongly associated with PARP-inhibitor toxicity. 
 Existing AR Inhibitors and Our Opportunity 
 Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an AR inhibitor that acts on different steps in the AR signaling pathway. Xtandi has been shown to potently bind to the AR and effectively compete for this receptor against its native ligand testosterone. Zytiga (abiraterone) is an inhibitor of androgen synthesis and results in decreased AR signaling through ligand depletion. Between 15% and 25% of patients do not respond to either AR signaling pathway inhibitors abiraterone or enzalutamide, and the vast majority of the responsive patients will ultimately become resistant, resulting in limited survival. Zytiga was approved for the treatment of mCRPC in 2011 and generated sales of $2.8 billion in 2019. Xtandi was approved for the treatment of mCRPC in 2012 and generated sales of approximately $3.7 billion in 2019. 
Prostate Cancer Overview 
 Prostate cancer is reported as the second and third leading cause of cancer death for men in the U.S. and in Europe, respectively. SEER cancer statistics estimated that approximately 175,000 men in the U.S. and 450,000 men in the EU5 would be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020, potentially resulting in a $15 billion market opportunity given the costs of treatment. 
 For early stage prostate cancer, the SOC is a radical prostatectomy, the removal of the prostate via surgery, or radiation therapy. While potentially curative, prostatectomy and/or radiation can result in serious side effects, including urinary and fecal incontinence and erectile dysfunction, as a result of damage to surrounding vital structures, blood vessels and nerves. Given the invasive nature of the procedure, prostatectomy surgery also brings the risk of complications with anesthesia, bleeding and infection. 
 mCRPC is the most advanced form of the disease and there are approximately 35,000 to 45,000 new incidences of mCRPC each year. Men with mCRPC have a poor prognosis and a predicted survival rate of fewer than two years from the initial time of progression. 
 Current SOC for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer provides that patients should initially receive a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and either abiraterone, which works by decreasing androgen levels, or enzalutamide, which works by blocking androgen binding to AR. If the disease progresses despite these second-generation hormonal therapies, chemotherapy is considered the next treatment option. Treatment with chemotherapy is generally postponed for as long as possible due to its effect on patients quality of life and the potential for severe side effects including neuropathies, nausea, diarrhea, decreased mental capacity and increased risk of infections.

 Preclinical Data 
 In an Xtandi (enzalutamide)-resistant prostate cancer model, NUV-1156 demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells more than Lynparza (olaparib), Xtandi (enzalutamide) or the combination of olaparib and enzalutamide. Cell proliferation, as measured by IC50, was more than 30,000 nanomolar for enzalutamide, nearly 8,000 nanomolar for olaparib and over 6,000 nanomolar for olaparib + enzalutamide. In contrast, NUV-1156 had an IC50 of 201 nanomolar, demonstrating that forming a DDC of a PARP inhibitor with a targeting agent that targets a receptor highly expressed in prostate cancer leads to orders of magnitude superior therapeutic effects compared to either agent alone, or even a combination of the two agents given in their native state. These results are shown in the table below. 
 NUV-1156 DDC POTENTLY KILLS PROSTATE CANCER CELLS RESISTANT TO CURRENT SOC 
 

Drug(s) | Cell Proliferation IC50(nM) | 
Xtandi (enzalutamide) | | >30,000
Lynparza (olaparib) | | 7,844 
Xtandi (enzalutamide) + Lynparza (olaparib) | | 6,152 
NUV-1156 (PARP x AR DDC) | | 201 

 As shown in the figure below, unlike Lynparza (olaparib) which is only approved in HR-D cancers and is not effective in HR-P tumors, NUV-1156 potently kills prostate cancer cells and triple negative breast cancer cells, whether they are HR-D or HR-P. We believe this underscores the superior potency of NUV-1156 as well as the potential for NUV-1156 to be used more broadly than current commercially available PARP inhibitors, which are limited to HR-D driven tumor types. 
 
20 


 NUV-1156 IS ACTIVE IN BOTH HR-D AND HR-P CANCER CELL LINES 
 

In an Xtandi (enzalutamide)-resistant prostate cancer cell model, NUV-1156 demonstrated the ability to kill cancer cells while sparing healthy gastrointestinal cells in vitro. In the figure below, the black bars represent prostate cancer cells as measured by a 22RV1 prostate epithelial cell line model and the gray bars represent gastrointestinal epithelial cells, or healthy tissue, as measured by an IEC-6, a standard model for healthy rat gastrointestinal epithelial cells. In this enzalutamide-resistant model, Xtandi (enzalutamide) had no toxicity on such gastrointestinal cells but, had little efficacy on Xtandi-resistant prostate cancer, a suboptimal effect. Lynparza (olaparib) fared even worse, having little efficacy on Xtandi-resistant prostate cancer, but killing gastrointestinal epithelial cells three times more potently than it kills prostate cancer cells. As compared to Lynparza (olaparib) and Xtandi (enzalutamide), NUV-1156 was observed to be significantly more potent and selective for prostate cancer cells than either Lynparza or Xtandi alone, killing Xtandi-resistant prostate cancer with low nanomolar potency while having little toxicity on healthy gastrointestinal epithelial cells. These results are shown in the graph below. 
 
21 


 NUV-1156 KILLS ENZALUTAMIDE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (HIGH AR) CELLS BUT SPARES HEALTHY COLON (LOW AR) CELLS IN VITRO



Thus, in preclinical models, NUV-1156 has demonstrated the ability to kill high AR-expressing tissues like prostate cancer while sparing low AR-expressing tissues like healthy gastrointestinal epithelial cells. This level of specificity may potentially allow a prostate-specific DDC to kill prostate cancer cells in the prostate while sparing other low AR-expressing cells like nerve and blood vessel cells, which are directly impacted during prostate ablation procedures like radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, the current SOC for early stage prostate cancer. While prostatectomy and radiation ablation are potentially curative, these interventions can result in serious side effects, including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and/or fecal incontinence, or other sequelae of invasive surgery, as a result of damage to the tissues surrounding or within the prostate like healthy blood vessels and nerve cells. We believe that NUV-1156 has the potential to become a non-surgical/non-radiation curative alternative for these patients, representing a large potential market opportunity. 
 Next Steps 
 We believe NUV-1156 may potentially address significant unmet medical need in mCRPC patients and may also eventually serve as an alternative to patients undergoing a radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. We are currently in preclinical development and intend to nominate our first lead clinical development candidate in the second half of 2022. 
 NUV-1176: Targeting ER and PARP for ER+ Breast Cancers 
 NUV-1176, our lead PARP-ER DDC, is an oral small molecule that is composed of a PARP inhibitor warhead that is fused to the binding domain of an ER targeting small molecule. In preclinical models, NUV-1176 potently kills both HR-D and HR-P ER+ tumor cell lines without killing healthy gastrointestinal epithelial cells. We are exploring the use of NUV-1176 for ER+ breast cancers and ovarian cancer. We are currently in preclinical development and intend to nominate our first lead clinical development candidate in the second half of 2022.

 Overview of ER+ Breast cancers 
 Prevalence and Prognosis 
 Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 1.8 million new diagnoses and 500,000 patients receiving treatment per year. In 2020, the ACS estimated there would be approximately 276,000 new cases of female breast cancer and over 40,000 deaths in the U.S. The ACS estimates that approximately 75-80% of all breast cancers are ER+, highlighting the central role of ER signaling in driving a large majority of ER+ mBC. When bound to estrogen, the ER directs the expression of genes that are essential for breast cancer cells survival and proliferation. 
 Although early-stage non-metastatic disease is curable in approximately 70-80% of patients, advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies (Harbeck, et al 2019). Advanced breast cancer comprises inoperable locally advanced breast cancer, which has not spread to distant organs, and metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer; common sites of spread are bone, lungs, liver and brain. Currently, it is a treatable but virtually incurable disease, with metastases being the cause of death in almost all patients, and a median overall survival of two to three years. Patients with metastatic breast cancer receive treatments that aim to relieve their symptoms and to prolong quality-adjusted life expectancy. 
 Treatment of ER+ Breast Cancer 
 ER+ breast cancer has led the way in drug development given the early appreciation for its dependence on estrogen signaling. The initial SOC for patients with early-stage ER+ breast cancer is at least five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy which commonly uses an ER antagonist (tamoxifen) or an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole). For patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer, endocrine therapy has been the backbone of treatment. In 2019, worldwide sales for endocrine and targeted therapies treating ER+ breast cancer patients totaled $9.6 billion. Given the incidence rate and cost of treatment, by 2027 the market size for adjuvant therapy, first line treatments and second line treatments could total $25 billion, $8 billion and $4 billion, respectively. 
 Due to emerging resistance to endocrine therapy, there has been a focus on developing a new generation of SERMs, AIs and SERDs. Resistance to endocrine treatment is due to multiple mechanisms, including changes in ER signaling and activation of other molecular pathways, such as CDK, mammalian target of mTOR, PI3K, MAPK and others (McAndrew & Finn, 2020). Recently, several agents targeting these mechanisms have been approved by the FDA: mTOR inhibitor everolimus (2012), followed by the approval of three CDK 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib [2015], ribociclib [2018] and abemaciclib [2018]), and more recently the PI3-K inhibitor alpelisib for a subgroup of patients with PI3K alterations (2019). For a select group of patients with HR-D breast cancer, talazoparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in 2018. Despite the fact that these new therapies in combination with endocrine therapy bring significant clinical benefit to ER+ mBC patients, it has been well established that patients will either not respond to or acquire resistance to treatment over the course of their disease and will eventually require cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is associated with significant side effects. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for ER+ mBC patients who exhausted available therapies and have to opt for the last resort of chemotherapy. 
 ER Selectively Expressed in ER-Specific Tissue 
 In women, ER protein expression is limited primarily to the sex organs, with median to high ER expression levels seen across the fallopian tube, breast, vagina, uterine, cervix and endometrium tissues. In contrast, ER expression is either low or not detected in the bone marrow and intestine, organs strongly associated with current commercially available PARP-inhibitor toxicity. Given that ER is more highly expressed in tumors that arise in female sex organ tissues like breast or ovarian cancer than tissues like the bone marrow or gastrointestinal tract, we believe an ER-targeted DDC will have improved anti-tumor activity while avoiding the toxicity profile associated with current commercially available PARP inhibitors.

 Preclinical data 
 We have developed NUV-1176, an ER-targeted DDC that is composed of a PARP inhibitor warhead that is fused to the binding domain of an ER-targeting small molecule. In preclinical models, as shown below, NUV-1176 has demonstrated the ability to potently kill both HR-D and HR-P ER+ tumor cell lines with minimal effects on healthy gastrointestinal cells. 
 NUV-1176, AN ER-TARGETED DDC, POTENTLY KILLS BOTH HR-D AND HR-P ER+ BREAST CANCER CELLS WITH MINIMAL EFFECTS ON HEALTHY COLON CELLS 
 


Next Steps 
 We are currently in preclinical development and intend to nominate our first lead clinical development candidate from our DDC platform in the second half of 2022. 
 Overview of NUV-868: Bromodomain Inhibitor Program 
 NUV-868 for AML 
 NUV-868, our lead candidate from our BET program, is an oral small molecule BET inhibitor that is almost 1,500 times more selective for BD2 over BD1, avoiding the toxicities associated with other non-BD2 selective inhibitors. We are currently in preclinical development and intend to initiate a Phase 1 trial in patients with AML in the first half of 2022. 
 BET as a Driver of Disease in AML 
 BET proteins are epigenetic readers that turn on specific genes by binding unique regions of the genome through their ability to read specific chemical tags on chromatin. In some instances, BET proteins turn on genes that are abnormally expressed in a variety of human cancers. BET inhibitors downregulate the expression of key genes that have the potential to cause cancer, or oncogenes, such as c-myc. C-myc is believed to play a role in promoting the growth of up to 70% of all cancers. These observations have resulted in the generation and clinical investigation of BET inhibitors in several cancer subtypes. 
 
24 


 BETs are comprised of two sub-domains: BD1, the inhibition of which is known to contribute to toxicity, and BD2, the inhibition of which is known to be important for efficacy. BET inhibitors have historically targeted both BD1 and BD2 less selectively, causing gastrointestinal toxicity and bone marrow suppressive effects like thrombocytopenia. 
 AML 
 In the U.S. alone in 2019, there will be an estimated 21,450 new cases of AML diagnosed and 10,920 deaths (Lai, et al2019). With a median age of 68 years and a five-year overall survival of roughly 25%, the prognosis remains poor. While 5-year OS is 40% to 50% for younger (under 50 years) patients with de novo AML, the estimated five-year OS for older patients, those with secondary AML, or relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease, is only 5% to 10%. Approximately half of patients over 60 years of age receive intensive induction chemotherapy, with the remainder receiving either non-intensive chemotherapy or supportive care. In the absence of adequate therapies, these R/R patients may be put into clinical trials for new and emerging therapies. 
 Treatment options for AML have been limited for the past five decades (Lai, et al 2019). The combination of an anthracycline and cytarabine known as 7 + 3 was initially reported in 1973, and induction therapy has remained relatively unchanged since then. While several therapies have been approved by the FDA during the past several years, there remains a significant unmet medical need with patients progressing despite therapy. Many of the new drugs are limited to a subgroup of patients with specific molecular alterations, and, most importantly, all patients progress on current therapies, and available subsequent therapeutic options are often limited to older chemotherapeutics and bone marrow transplantation. The recently approved drugs include fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-targeting drugs (midostaurin, gilteritinib), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 inhibitors (enasidenib, ivosidenib), bcl-2inhibitor (venetoclux), smoothened pathway inhibitor (glasdegib) and ADC gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 
 Our SolutionNUV-868
NUV-868, our lead candidate from our BET program, is an oral small molecule BET inhibitor that is almost 1,500 times more selective for BD2 than BD1, avoiding the toxicities associated with other non-BD2 selective inhibitors. Given BETs promise as an oncology target, there are several BET inhibitors in development for several cancers. ABBV-774 is a BET inhibitor that is 324 times more potent for BD2 than BD1. Other BET inhibitors that are not as selective for BD2, have been associated with toxicities including gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia. The selectivity of several BET inhibitors that are currently in development is shown in the table below. 
 NUV-868 IS A MORE SELECTIVE BD2 INHIBITOR 
 IC50 values of NUV-868 and other BET inhibitors in development 
 


In two AML xenograft models, including a Kasumi-1 and an MV-4-11 model, NUV-868 demonstrated anti-tumor activity as compared to vehicle across three doses (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) out to 21 days, as shown in the graphs below. Notably, near complete tumor regression was observed in the 10-20 mg/kg NUV-868 group. 
 
25 


 NUV-868 IS HIGHLY POTENT IN KILLING AML CELLS IN IN VIVO XENOGRAFT MODELS 
 


NUV-868s BD2 selectivity avoids gut toxicity observed with other dual BD1 / BD2 BET inhibitors. In tissue samples from a rat small intestine treated with vehicle and ABBV-075 and NUV-868, treatment with ABBV-075 led to a marked reduction in healthy goblet cells, which are central in protecting the mucous membrane in the GI tract. By comparison, a notably higher dose (30mg/kg) of NUV-868 showed no apparent evidence of goblet cell loss. These results are shown in the images below. We believe this data supports the potential for NUV-868 to limit the gastrointestinal toxicities that are associated with other BET inhibitors. 
 HIGH SELECTIVITY FOR BD2 OVER BD1 REDUCES THE GUT TOXICITY OBSERVED WITH OTHER BET INHIBITORS 
 

ABBV-075 (Dual BD1 / BD2) Faivre et al 2020 | NUV-868 (BD2 Selective)

 The other main toxicity associated with BET inhibitors is thrombocytopenia. While most non-selective BET inhibitors lower platelet levels and cause thrombocytopenia, NUV-868 has demonstrated higher platelet levels as a function of reversing platelet suppression associated with untreated tumor burden and a lack of bone marrow-suppressive side effects. In the table below, platelet counts are measured in a MV 4-11 AML xenograft hematology panel 24 hours post the final dose of NUV-868 on day 21 across three dose levels. As compared to treatment with vehicle, platelet counts rose for the NUV-868 cohorts across the low (5 mg/kg), medium (10 mg/kg) and high (20 mg/kg) doses.

Next Steps 
 We are currently in preclinical development and intend to initiate a Phase 1 trial of NUV-868 in patients with AML and/or solid tumors in the first half of 2022. 
 Overview of NUV-569: Wee1 Program 
 NUV-569, is a differentiated selective inhibitor of Wee1 kinase, an important regulator of DNA damage repair, which we are initially developing for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and solid tumors. Wee1 is responsible for controlling the cellular checkpoint that can signal to a dividing cell to pause while damaged DNA is repaired. Inhibition of this kinase can cause catastrophic DNA damage to a tumor cell triggering programmed cell death. We have designed NUV-569 to avoid off-target effects that could increase the therapeutic window for this class of therapeutic candidates and have wide applicability to treating many different types of cancer. We intend to submit an IND for NUV-569 in the first half of 2022 and initiate Phase 1 trials in patients with pancreatic cancer and/or other solid tumors in the second half of 2022. 
 Background on Wee1 and DNA Damage Repair 
 DNA damage occurs frequently throughout the cell cycle, and even more frequently in rapidly dividing cancer cells, as a result of the challenge of endogenous and exogenous DNA insults and stressors. In response to DNA damage, cells have evolved a network of complex, coordinated DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR involves a network of DNA repair pathways and DNA damage checkpoints that are linked through various signaling mechanisms responsible for sensing and responding to specific types of DNA damage that affect DNA repair, cell cycle regulation replication stress responses and apoptosis. Defects in the DDR result in genomic instability and ultimately promote the cloning of cancer cells. 
 Wee1 is one of many kinases involved in regulation of signaling within the cell cycle and DNA damage identification and repair within the DDR. Specifically, Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase that allows cells with DNA damage to repair and survive by activating the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint through inhibition of the phosphorylation of CDK1/2, thus suspending the process of cell division in healthy cells. In cancer cells, tumors activate their Wee1 checkpoint in order to arrest the process of cell division, thus allowing them to repair their damaged DNA and replicate, resulting in tumor growth. Inhibition of cellular regulation and repair mechanisms within the cell cycle and DDR, such as Wee1, may potentially play a crucial role in the induction of apoptosis, improve the efficacy of DNA-damaging cancer therapies to which cancer cells have already developed multiple mechanisms of resistance, and may improve the efficacy of DNA-damaging radiation treatment. Specifically, Wee1 inhibitors force tumor cells to replicate prior to DNA repair, leading to incorrect DNA replication and ultimately tumor cell death. 
 
27 


 Wee1 Inhibitors in Clinical Development and Limitations 
 We are aware of only several Wee1 inhibitors currently in clinical development, including AZD1775. AZD1775 is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in ovarian cancer and a variety of other solid tumors, both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies. In these trials, multiple patients with advanced or metastatic tumors for whom no standard therapy was available achieved partial responses when dosed with AZD1775 in combination with chemotherapy agents. For example, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in 24 patients (21 of whom were evaluable for efficacy) with relapsed ovarian cancer, the combination of AZD1775 and carboplatin demonstrated an overall response rate of 43% and one patient exhibited a complete response lasting over 42 months. 
 In addition, AZD1775 demonstrated encouraging overall survival in a recent Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer as compared to historical trials in this patient population. AZD1775 in combination with SOC gemcitabine, and radiation resulted in a median overall survival of 21.7 months. More recently, AZD1775 demonstrated an overall response rate of 30% in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent uterine serous carcinoma, an aggressive subtype of endometrial carcinoma characterized by TP53 mutations. 
 Although AZD1775 has shown encouraging clinical efficacy data in patients with uterine serous carcinoma and ovarian and pancreatic cancers, we believe it has the following limitations with regards to its safety profile. 
 

 | Potent inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). PLK1 is a cell kinase that phosphorylates Wee1 as the cell approaches the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint thus promoting and enabling the cell replication process. PLK1 may be responsible for gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity. AZD1775 is a highly potent inhibitor of PLK1, having demonstrated an IC50 of 15 nanomolar in biochemical studies, and thus may contribute to bone marrow and GI toxicity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Liver enzyme inhibition. AZD1775 inhibits liver enzyme CYP3A4, which is responsible for elimination of drug and drug metabolites from the body.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tolerability. In a recent Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine, an FDA-approved chemotherapy, and radiation, eight patients (24%) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, most commonly anorexia, nausea, or fatigue, thus preventing continuous dosing of AZD1775.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our SolutionNUV-569
NUV-569, our lead candidate from our Wee1 program, is an oral small molecule Wee1 inhibitor that we have designed in order to avoid off-target effects that we believe could increase the therapeutic window for this class of therapeutic candidates. We believe that NUV-569 could have wide applicability to treating many different types of cancer. Our Wee1 inhibitor is highly potent against Wee1 and is designed to have low inhibition of PLK1, thus potentially reducing the toxicity that has been seen in other Wee1 inhibitors, such as AZD1775. Specifically, in our preclinical studies NUV-569 demonstrated single digit nanomolar inhibition of Wee1, 45-fold lower PLK1 inhibition than AZD1775 and 9-fold lower potency in inhibiting proliferation of rat gut epithelial cells (IEC6), than AZD1775, which we believe suggests NUV-569 may have better GI tolerability than AZD1775. The following table demonstrates the favorable potency and selectivity profile of NUV-569 compared to AZD1775. 
 
28 


 NUV-569 IS POTENT AGAINST WEE1 BUT CAUSES LESS INHIBITION OF PLK1 AND RAT GUT EPITHELIAL CELLS THAN AZD1775 IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES 
 

Preclinical Results 
 In an in vitro preclinical study of pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine and radiation therapy, we observed NUV-569s anti-tumor activity and potency in inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells, as shown in the graph below. 
 NUV-569 INCREASES IN VITRO KILLING OF PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS BY CHEMO AND/OR RADIATION 
 


Next Steps 
 We are currently in preclinical development and intend to initiate Phase 1 trial of NUV-569 in patients with pancreatic cancer and/or other solid tumors in the second half of 2022. In addition to pancreatic cancer, we are also evaluating NUV-569 in breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer. 
 
29 


 A2a Adenosine Receptor Program 
 Our adenosine receptor program is focused on targeting the A2a adenosine receptor. The A2a adenosine receptor plays multiple critical roles in human physiology and pathophysiology including anti-cancer immunity, which makes it an important drug target. Accumulation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment may be a critical factor in limiting the activity of currently available immune-oncology drugs, including anti-PD1/PD-L1 drugs and anti-cancer chimeric T cells. Thus, targeting the adenosine receptor may overcome this blockade, leading to improved anti-cancer activity in tumors which are resistant to immune-oncology drugs and T cell therapies. We are conducting preclinical studies in order to support the initiation of a Phase 1 trial in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
 In our preclinical studies, our adenosine receptor inhibitor, NUV-1182, has high affinity for the A2a adenosine receptor demonstrating single digit nanomolar binding affinity. NUV-1182 was also designed to have reduced affinity for the adenosine A1 receptor which may potentially improve tolerability. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that NUV-1182 has a desirable pharmacokinetic profile, with high exposure following a single oral dose in mice. Furthermore, in a melanoma cell line derived xenograft model, daily oral dosing with NUV-1182 enhanced the tumor suppressive activity when combined with either an anti-PD1 antibody or an anti-PD-L1 antibody. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for our investigational products, to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing, in the U.S. and certain other countries, patent applications intended to cover the composition of matter of our investigational products, their methods of use and related discoveries, technologies, inventions and improvements that may be commercially important to our business. We may also rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We also intend to take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
 We have investigational products in a number of therapeutic targets. As of December 31, 2020, our company-owned patent portfolio consists of two issued U.S. patents, over 15 pending U.S. patent applications, over 15 pending PCT patent applications, and over 40 pending foreign patent applications, in jurisdictions such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, India, Israel, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, directed to compositions of matter, methods of synthesis and methods of use related to our investigational products. Of these, four patent families are directed to investigational products in our CDK Program, three patent families are directed to investigational products in our DDC Program, five patent families are directed to investigational products in our BET Program, eight patent families are directed to investigational products in our Wee1 Program and eight patent families are directed to investigational products in our Adenosine Program. The term of any patents that issue from our company-owned U.S. and foreign patent applications will vary in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction, but is typically 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. Any patents that may issue in the future from our company-owned pending patent applications are projected to expire between 2038 and 2041, unless extended or otherwise adjusted. 
 The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the U.S. and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our investigational products and enforce the patent rights that we own, and could affect the value of such intellectual property and the business. With respect to our company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that the patent applications we are currently pursuing or may file in the future will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Our competitors may independently develop similar investigational products or technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any company-owned patents that may issue. We cannot be sure that any patents granted to us will be commercially useful in protecting our products or their methods of use or manufacture. Moreover, even issued patents do not guarantee us the right to commercialize our products. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing or manufacturing our investigational products. 
 
30 


 Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of an investigational product, it is possible that, before a product can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. In the U.S., the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved product may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended and the amount of available extension to any PTE-eligible patent depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates related to the regulatory review period. Possible extensions may be available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved product. While we intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available to us, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA or the USPTO, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We cannot be sure that any patents will issue from any pending or future company-owned patent applications. Even if patents do issue, we cannot be sure that the claims of these patents will be held valid or enforceable by a court of law or governmental agency, will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products, or will afford us a commercial advantage over competitive products. For example: 
 

 | we might not have been the first to file patent applications for the inventions covered by our pending patent applications and any patents that issue therefrom;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | some or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or the claims that issue may be narrow in scope and not provide us with a competitive advantage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any patents that issue from any of our pending patent applications may be challenged by a third party and invalidated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any patents that issue from our pending patent applications may be subject to post-grant proceedings, oppositions or other administrative or court proceedings that may result in a reduction in their scope or their loss altogether;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we may not develop proprietary technologies or investigational products that are patentable; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the patents of others may prevent us from discovering, developing or commercializing our investigational products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The defense and prosecution of intellectual property infringement suits, post-grant proceedings, oppositions and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly, time-consuming to pursue and divert resources. The outcome of these types of proceedings is uncertain and could significantly harm our business. 
 The development of our investigational products and the commercialization of any resulting drugs may be impacted by patents of other companies or by companies engaged in the development of competitive programs or those with significantly greater resources. This could result in the expenditure of significant legal fees and management resources. 
 
31 


 We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology and product candidates, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are often difficult to protect, especially outside of the U.S. While we believe that we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, partners and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets to others, including competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally disclosed, obtained or is using our trade secrets would be expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Even if we are able to maintain our trade secrets as confidential, our competitors may independently develop information that is equivalent or similar to our trade secrets. 
 Collaboration Agreement with SPARCBIO LLC 
 On January 21, 2019, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with SPARCBIO LLC under which SPARCBIO LLC conducts drug discovery and development activities for our programs. We pay SPARCBIO LLCs costs to conduct these activities, at least $5,000,000 per year, and we own all inventions and results. The Collaboration Agreement has a five-year term and may be terminated by either party for the other partys uncured material breach. If SPARCBIO LLC terminates the Collaboration Agreement for our uncured material breach within the first three years, we remain obligated to pay the annual fee for the first three years. We may terminate the Collaboration Agreement without cause after the first three years. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our investigational products for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our investigational products obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational products, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our investigational products. 
 To date, we have obtained APIs and drug product for our investigational products from single-source third-party CMOs. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our investigational products and intend to put in place framework agreements under which CMOs will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs, and which agreements will provide us with intellectual property rights necessary to conduct the business. We seek to use a different CMO for each investigational product and will consider further diversification of drug product and supply organizations as circumstances warrant. Overall, as we advance our investigational products through development, we will start by seeking multiple sources for raw materials and address other potential points in concern over time. 
Commercialization 
 We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our investigational products and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our investigational products on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the U.S. and other regions. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and sales, marketing and commercial product distribution capabilities for the U.S., and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our investigational products. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population and the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs and economics related to the foregoing may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. 
 
32 


 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer therapies. Any investigational products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop small molecules and drug conjugates as treatments for cancer patients. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing such treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in partnership with Sanofi Genzyme (Sanofi) and Roche. 
 For our CDK2/4/6 inhibitor, we are aware of several clinical-stage CDK inhibitors being developed as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, including, but not limited to, product candidates being developed by Adastra Pharmaceuticals Inc., Merck, Pfizer, Tiziana Life Sciences plc, Gan & Lee, Cyclacel, Onconova and G1 Therapeutics. In addition, CDK 4/6 inhibitors from Pfizer, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) and Eli Lilly are commercially available for patients with breast cancer and are also in clinical trials for other types of cancer. G1 Therapeutics recently received approval with its CDK4/6 inhibitor to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. 
 For our BET inhibitor, we are aware of several clinical-stage BET inhibitors being developed for patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including, but not limited to, product candidates from AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BMS, Boehringer Ingelheim, Celgene, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Forma Therapeutics, GlaxoSmithKline, Incyte Corporation, Merck/Oncoethix, Orion Pharma, Plexxikon (part of Daiichi Sankyo), Resverlogix, Roche and Zenith Epigenetics (Newsoara Biopharma). To our knowledge, there is currently no commercially available BET inhibitor and the most advanced BET inhibitor is in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Some BET inhibitors are also developed for non-oncology indications. 
 For our Wee1 inhibitor, we are aware of several clinical-stage Wee1 inhibitors being developed for patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including product candidates from AstraZeneca, Debiopharm (Almac Discovery) and Zentalis. To our knowledge, there is currently no commercially available Wee1 inhibitor and the most advanced Wee1 inhibitor is in Phase 2 development. 
 For our adenosine receptor antagonist, we are aware of several other clinical-stage adenosine antagonists being developed, including, but not limited to, product candidates from Arcus Biosciences, Inc./Gilead Sciences, Inc., AstraZeneca, Corvus Pharmaceuticals Inc, CStone Pharmaceuticals, Incyte Corporation, iTeos Therapeutics Inc., Palobiofarma/Novartis and Ryvu Therapeutics SA. To our knowledge, there is currently no adenosine receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced adenosine receptor antagonist is in Phase 2 development. 
 Our DDC programs targeting hormone receptors in cancer cells apply to types of cancer that may depend on hormone receptors for their growth, such as ER+ mBC, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. All of these tumors have commercially available therapies including therapies from AstraZeneca, Bayer, Clovis Oncology, Dendreon, Eli Lilly, GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi. In addition, many new drug candidates are being developed as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs for these tumors, and the most advanced of these development programs are in Phase 3 and may lead to near-term regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization. These development programs include those of the companies named above as well as numerous others. Some of these drugs and drug candidates target hormone receptor pathways directly, while many others may affect cancer cell growth through different mechanisms of action. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our investigational products, if approved, are likely to be their degree of efficacy, tolerability profile, convenience and price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics (if required), the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
U.S. Drug Development 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (NDA), process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
34 


 
 | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related protocols and regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 Preclinical Studies and IND 
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials 
 The clinical-stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 
35 


 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well designed and well conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and. the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary. An NDA based solely on foreign clinical data meeting U.S. criteria for marketing approval may be approved if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and (3) the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection or other appropriate means, if deemed necessary 
 Clinical trials in the U.S. generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 
36 


 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our product candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life. 
 We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which the FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the clinical trial, and any disruption of the clinical trial as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a list of all subjects affected by the COVID-19-pandemic related study disruption by unique subject identifier and by investigational site and a description of how the individuals participation was altered; and analyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the clinical trial. In June 2020, FDA also issued a guidance on good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in drug products manufacturing, including recommendations for manufacturing controls to prevent contamination of drugs. 
 NDA Review Process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the U.S. for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug. 
 The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a products use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the U.S. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 
37 


 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 Orphan Drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitors product for the same indication. If one of our product candidates designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.

 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-approval Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as off-label promotion, and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 
39 


 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention;
--+------------------------------


 | refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Other U.S. Regulatory Matters 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to various healthcare laws, regulation, and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Our conduct, including those of our employees, as well as our business operations and relationships with third parties, including current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
40 


 
 | The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties law prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations also impose obligations on covered entities such as health insurance plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; additionally, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promoted Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, under the provision titled Fighting the Opioid Epidemic with Sunshine, in part, extends the reporting and transparency requirements for physicians under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners, with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made, or ownership and investment interests held, in 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and require the registration of their sales representatives, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Affordable Care Act. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements. 
 
41 


 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. 
 U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if issued, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.

 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.

 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU. 
 European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area (EEA), which comprises the 28 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of MAs. 

 | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.

 | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SOPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SOPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMSs decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. 
 
43 


 Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Additionally, coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. 
 In addition, in case a drug product needs companion diagnostics, then companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

 Healthcare Reform 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal healthcare programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturers outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. 
 There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, there have been several executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have passed. In 2017, the Tax Act repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Acts mandated Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a federal circuit decision that previously upheld Congress denial of $12.0 billion in risk corridor funding. In December 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, in December 2019, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. In March 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case. It is unclear how such litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business. Complying with any new legislation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. The CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020, and designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 suspension. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations. 
 Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135.0 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the administration sent principles for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the administration previously released a Blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on July 24, 2020, the administration announced four executive orders to lower drug prices, including allowing importation of certain drugs, changing how drug rebates are negotiated by middlemen, like pharmacy benefit managers, and directing such rebates to be passed to patients as point-of-sale discounts, and requiring Medicare to pay certain Part B drugs at the lowest price available in economically comparable countries (the details of which were released on September 13, 2020 and also expanded the policy to cover certain Part D drugs). The president has delayed the effective date of the international drug pricing order, pending discussion with major drug companies. How these executive orders will be implemented and their impact on the industry remain uncertain. Additionally, the FDA recently released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact our business. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the U.S. directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
