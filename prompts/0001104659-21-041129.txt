Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on November 6, 2018 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to in this report as our initial business combination. Following our initial business combination, our objective will be to implement or support the acquired business’ growth and operating strategies.
 
While we may pursue a business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we initially focused our search for a target in Argentina and/or Brazil on industries we believed would have favorable prospects and a high likelihood of generating strong risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The Proposed Business Combination with FoA, described below, is the result of an extensive search for a potential transaction utilizing our management’s relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment professionals at private equity firms, family offices and other financial sponsors, owners of private businesses, investment bankers, consultants and attorneys. 
 
In December 2018, we issued 7,187,500 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In March 2019, our sponsor transferred to our independent directors an aggregate of 90,000 founder shares at the same price originally paid for such shares.
 
The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-230347) for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 3, 2019. On April 8, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering of 28,750,000 units, including the issuance of 3,750,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $287,500,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the full over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $7,750,000 (the “private placement”).
 
A total of $287,500,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination within the required time period and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable.
 
Transaction costs amounted to approximately $5.9 million, consisting of $5.25 million of underwriting fees and approximately $638,000 of other costs. In addition, the underwriters of our initial public offering agreed to defer approximately $9.2 million in underwriting commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination, if consummated.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $850,000 outside of the trust account and a working capital deficit of approximately $836,000.
 
Our units began trading on April 4, 2019 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “RPLA.U.” Commencing on April 18, 2019, the ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “RPLA” and “RPLA WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “RPLA.U.”
 
On August 15, 2019, we received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the staff of NYSE Regulation of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) indicating that we were not then in compliance with Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the “Manual”), which requires us to maintain a minimum of 300 public shareholders on a continuous basis. Pursuant to the Notice, we were subject to the procedures set forth in Sections 801 and 802 of the Manual. We submitted a business plan that demonstrated how we expected to return to compliance with the minimum public shareholders requirement within 18 months of receipt of the Notice. On October 24, 2019, we were notified by the staff of NYSE Regulation that the NYSE’s Listings Operations Committee agreed to accept our business plan, and we were subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance with such plan. On November 5, 2020, we were notified by the staff of NYSE Regulation that we are a “company back in compliance” with Section 802.01B of the Manual. Our ordinary shares, warrants and units, which trade under the symbols “RPLA,” “RPLA WS” and “RPLA.U,” respectively, continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and no longer bear the indicator “.BC” on the consolidated tape to indicate noncompliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standards.

Proposed Business Combination
 
On October 12, 2020, we entered into a Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with Finance of America Equity Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“FoA”); Finance of America Companies Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of our company (“New Pubco”); RPLY Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of New Pubco (“Replay Merger Sub”); RPLY BLKR Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of New Pubco (“Blocker Merger Sub”); Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Fund (Urban Feeder) – NQ L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Blocker”); Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Associates – NQ L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“Blocker GP”); BTO Urban Holdings L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“BTO Urban”), Blackstone Family Tactical Opportunities Investment Partnership – NQ – ESC L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“ESC”), Libman Family Holdings LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company (“Family Holdings”), The Mortgage Opportunity Group LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company (“TMO”), L and TF, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (“L&TF”), UFG Management Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Management Holdings”), and Joe Cayre (each of BTO Urban, ESC, Family Holdings, TMO, L&TF, Management Holdings and Joe Cayre, a “Seller” and, collectively, the “Sellers”); and BTO Urban and Family Holdings, solely in their joint capacity as the representative of the Sellers pursuant to Section 12.18 of the Transaction Agreement (the “Seller Representative”), pursuant to which we agreed to combine with FoA in a series of transactions (collectively, the “Proposed Business Combination”) that will result in New Pubco becoming a publicly-traded company on the NYSE and controlling FoA in an “UP-C” structure.
 
The Proposed Business Combination encompasses a series of transactions to effect an “UP-C” structure, pursuant to which, among other things: (i) we will change our jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware by deregistering as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”), whereby (A) each of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the Domestication will be converted into a unit representing a limited liability company interest in our company (each, a “Replay LLC Unit”) and (B) we will be governed by a limited liability company agreement; (ii) the Sellers and Blocker GP will sell to us limited liability company interests in FoA (“FoA Units”) in exchange for cash; (iii) Replay Merger Sub will merge with and into our company (the “Replay Merger”), with our company surviving the Replay Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of New Pubco and each Replay LLC Unit outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Replay Merger being converted into the right to receive one share of New Pubco’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”); (iv) Blocker will be converted from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware limited liability company; (v) Blocker Merger Sub will merge with and into Blocker (the “Blocker Merger”), with Blocker surviving the Blocker Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of New Pubco and each limited liability company interest of Blocker (each, a “Blocker Share”) outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Blocker Merger being converted into the right to receive a combination of shares of Class A Common Stock and cash; (vi) Blocker GP will contribute its remaining FoA Units to New Pubco in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock, after which New Pubco will contribute such FoA Units to Blocker; and (vii) New Pubco will issue to the Sellers shares of New Pubco’s Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B Common Stock”), which will have no economic rights but will entitle each holder of at least one such share (regardless of the number of shares so held) to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of FoA Units held by such holder on all matters on which stockholders of New Pubco are entitled to vote generally.
 
As a result of the Proposed Business Combination, among other things: (A) New Pubco will indirectly hold (through our company and Blocker) FoA Units and will have the sole and exclusive right to appoint the board of managers of FoA; (B) the Sellers will hold (i) FoA Units that are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) shares of Class B Common Stock; and (C) the holders of Blocker Shares outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Blocker Merger and Blocker GP will, directly or indirectly, hold shares of Class A Common Stock.
 
The consummation of the Proposed Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement including, among others, receipt of the requisite approval of our shareholders, satisfaction of the minimum cash requirements provided in the Transaction Agreement, the termination or expiration of all required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), and the execution of the various related transaction agreements.
 
On November 4, 2020, the request for early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the Proposed Business Combination was granted by the Federal Trade Commission. On February 12, 2021, the SEC declared effective New Pubco’s registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-249897), as amended, filed with the SEC in connection with the Proposed Business Combination (the “New Pubco Registration Statement”), which includes a proxy statement with respect to our extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “General Meeting”) to approve the Proposed Business Combination, among other matters, that constitutes a prospectus of New Pubco with respect to the securities to be issued in the Proposed Business Combination. On February 12, 2021, we filed our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the “Proxy Statement”) with the SEC, which was mailed on or about that date to our shareholders as of January 28, 2021, the record date for the General Meeting. The General Meeting has been scheduled for March 25, 2021.

Concurrently with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, (i) we entered into subscription agreements with various investors, including an affiliate of our sponsor, pursuant to which such investors agreed to purchase our ordinary shares (which ordinary shares will be converted into Replay LLC Units pursuant to the Domestication and then will be converted into the right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Replay Merger) (each such subscription agreement, a “Replay PIPE Agreement”), and (ii) New Pubco entered into subscription agreements with certain funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group Inc. and Brian L. Libman and certain entities controlled by him (collectively, the “Principal Stockholders”, and together with the investors party to the Replay PIPE Agreements, the “PIPE Investors”) pursuant to which the Principal Stockholders agreed to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock (together with our ordinary shares being purchased pursuant to the Replay PIPE Agreements, the “PIPE Shares”). In the aggregate, the PIPE Investors have committed to purchase $250.0 million of PIPE Shares, at a purchase price of $10.00 per PIPE Share, including $10.0 million of PIPE Shares to be purchased by an affiliate of our sponsor.
 
FoA is a vertically integrated, diversified lending platform that connects borrowers with investors. FoA operates with the goal of minimizing risk; it offers a diverse set of high-quality consumer loan products and distributes that risk to investors for an up-front cash profit and typically some future performance-based participation. In addition to FoA’s profitable lending operations, it provides a variety of services to lenders through its Lender Services segment, which augments its lending profits with an attractive fee-oriented revenue stream.
 
Management Expertise
 
Our management team is led by our founders, Edmond Safra, Gregorio Werthein and Gerardo Werthein. Our founders collectively have decades of experience investing in, managing and operating companies across a variety of industries. We believe that our management team has established a favorable reputation in the business community, built strong partnerships with first-tier international institutional investors and developed a vast network of corporate relationships. In addition to our management team’s direct involvement, we have recruited and will continue to recruit industry experts to evaluate potential investment opportunities. We believe that our management team’s extensive network will allow them to attract, select and retain high-performing members of management.
 
We have drawn and will continue to draw upon the extensive networks, relationships and investment personnel of our management team and our sponsor to identify, source, negotiate and execute an initial business combination, including the Proposed Business Combination. We believe that the reputations of the members of our management team will make us a preferred partner for potential initial business combination targets, such as FoA. Furthermore, we believe that these relationships give us access to key resources to understand macroeconomic trends, government policies and reforms, regulatory frameworks, investor expectations and market sentiment.
 
The past performance of our management team and their affiliates is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our sponsor, management team and their affiliates as indicative of our future performance. None of the members of our management team has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
The rules of the NYSE require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in trust (net of taxes payable and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (1) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We have until April 8, 2021 to complete our initial business combination, unless we obtain the approval of our shareholders to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we must complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, wind up our affairs and subsequently dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 8, 2021 (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association).
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.

Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, ordinary shares and warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. Such reports and other information filed by the company with the SEC are available free of charge on our website and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this report. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of a prospective target business as part of any tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 
We were required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the JOBS Act, and will remain such for up to five years. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. However, if our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
