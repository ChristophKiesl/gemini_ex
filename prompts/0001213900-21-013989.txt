Item 1. Business Overview
 
Ipsidy Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) is a provider of an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) platform that delivers a suite of secure, mobile, biometric identity solutions, available to any vertical, anywhere. In a world that is increasingly digital and mobile, our mission is to help our customers know with biometric certainty the identity of the people with whom they are engaging. We provide solutions to everyday problems: Who is applying for a loan? Who is accessing the computer system? Who is chatting with my customer service? Who is transferring funds?
 
Ipsidy provides secure, biometric, identity verification and electronic transaction authentication services. We have developed an IDaaS platform for our customers, be they businesses, residences, governments, or other organizations, to enable their users to more easily verify and authenticate their identity through a mobile phone or portable device of their choosing (as opposed to dedicated hardware). Our system enables participants to consent to transactions using their biometric information with a digitally signed authentication response, including the underlying transaction data. In this way our systems can provide pre-transaction authentication of identity as well as embed each user’s identity attributes, within every electronic transaction message processed through our platform, or other electronic systems.
 
We believe that it is essential that businesses and consumers know who is on the other side of an electronic transaction and have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the other party was duly authenticated. Our solutions are intended to provide our customers with the next level of transaction security, control and certainty. Our platform uses biometric and multi-factor identity solutions, which are intended to verify and authenticate identity during a wide variety of electronic transactions. We define “electronic transactions” in the broadest sense to include not only financial transactions (i.e. exchanges of value in all of their forms), and legal transactions (e.g. approving the release of personal or other confidential data), but also access control to both digital environments (e.g. accessing financial accounts, voting systems, email systems, healthcare records, and controlling data network log-ins) and physical environments (e.g. entrances to offices, public buildings, data centers and other sensitive locations).
 
The Company’s products focus on the broad requirement for identity verification and multi-factor authentication,. Organizations of all descriptions require cost-effective and secure means of mitigating identity fraud-whether that fraud takes place during a new account onboarding or an attempt to takeover an existing account by the misuse of the account holder’s personal information or access credentials. We aim to offer our customers solutions that can be integrated easily into each customer’s business and organizational operations in order to facilitate their use and enhance the end user customer experience.
 
ProofTM our mobile identity onboarding and verification application, establishes the trusted identity of users based on a variety of ground truth sources, such as chip-based electronic machine readable travel documents, or eMRTDs, national IDs, drivers licenses, as well as by means of direct verification by national ID databases in Peru and South Africa. The application uses these sources to obtain trusted demographic information and the reference facial biometric images that are matched against the user’s captured live selfie. Proof enables the remote onboarding of people in services associated with fintech, telecom, healthcare, government services and other online services-based industries.
 
Our identity authentication solution, Verified™ by Ipsidy, can be delivered seamlessly via mobile web browser, by Ipsidy’s mobile application or into a customer’s mobile app, using our SDK’s. Verified helps our customers gain identity certainty of their users (customers and employees) who can conveniently and securely consent to a variety of electronic transactions, using their biometrics. For example, we signed an agreement with a global financial services banking platform provider, which has integrated Verified to secure access to their online banking software. Ipsidy has also integrated its authentication services to allow trucking fleets and drivers to use their biometrics to securely open locks that safeguard valuable assets and physical environments.

In 2020 we added a FIDO2 strong authentication solution, AuthentifIDTM, developed under our strategic partnership with LoginID. AuthentifID by Ipsidy delivers trusted FIDO2 strong authentication for passwordless login and transaction authentication tied to a trusted identity. During user registration, AuthentifID leverages Ipsidy’s seamless biometric identity verification service to scan an identity document and take a selfie, to establish a digital chain of trust between biometrically verified individuals, their accounts, and their devices. An international bank entered into an agreement with us to use AuthentifID in order to provide added security to users of its banking systems.
 
The Company’s solutions for fingerprint-based identity management and electronic payment transaction processing have been in the market for several years. For example, in December 2017, we won an international competitive tender to provide our SearchTM Automated Fingerprint Identification de-duplication system (AFIS) to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, for them to ensure that no duplicate entries existed in the voter roll for the 2018 election. The AFIS system was delivered under tight deadlines and within budget, in order to enable the voter roll to be published and the election to occur as planned.
 
Management believes that some of the advantages of the Company’s IDaaS Platform approach are the ability to leverage the platform to support a variety of vertical markets including the identity solutions and transaction processing sectors and the adaptability of the platform to the requirements of new markets and new products requiring low cost, secure, and configurable mobile solutions. These vertical markets include but are not limited to banking and payment transactions, elections, schools, public transportation, government and enterprise security. At its core, the Company’s offering, combining its proprietary and acquired biometric technologies is intended to facilitate the processing of diverse electronic transactions, be they payments, votes, or physical or digital access, all of which can include identity verification, authentication and identity transaction recording. The Company continues to invest in developing, patenting and acquiring the various elements necessary to enhance the platform, which is intended to allow us to achieve our goals.
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 21, 2011 and changed its name to Ipsidy Inc. on February 1, 2017, and our common stock is traded on the OTCQB U.S. Market under the trading symbol “IDTY”. Our corporate headquarters is located at 670 Long Beach Blvd., Long Beach, NY 11561 and our main phone number is (516) 274-8700. We maintain a website at www.ipsidy.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 
Global Market Opportunity
 
We believe that there are several market trends that drive growth in the identity verification and authentication marketplace. These trends include digital transformation and the impact of the widespread adoption of mobile technology, increased fraud as a result of that adoption and increased regulation by governments around the world to protect consumers personally identifiable information, or PII. The events of 2020 and the reaction to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Digital Transformation
 
Digital and mobile technologies have significantly changed people’s lives in a remarkably short time, including how we shop, socialize and bank. In 2020, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic with its stay-at-home mandates accelerated digital adoption by even the most reluctant consumers. The global health crisis dramatically altered service delivery across broad market segments, creating lasting effects that we believe are likely to stay, even after the pandemic ends.
 
Enterprises that were able to, scrambled to reduce reliance on physical outlets and to drive customers to remote digital channels offering seamless and secure user experiences. Electronic services—from mobile banking to online grocery shopping to tele-medicine—have increased multifold within the past year. According to a study conducted by Enterprise Technology Research of 1,200 chief information officers from across the world, the number of permanent remote workers is expected to double to 34.4% of their companies’ workforces in 2021, compared with 16.4% before the coronavirus outbreak (Reuters, “Permanently remote workers seen doubling in 2021 due to pandemic productivity: survey” 2020).

Accordingly, digital transformation efforts that pre-dated the 2020 crisis are likely to have been prioritized and accelerated. Statista estimates that between 2020 and 2023 digital transformation investments are projected to total US$6.8 trillion. The company also forecasts that as much as 65% of the world’s gross domestic product will be digitalized by 2022. (Statista “Spending on digital transformation technologies and services worldwide from 2017 to 2023” 2020).
 
Key to successful transformation efforts is the ability to onboard new users with speed and accuracy as well as to stop identity fraud at the entrance. MarketsandMarkets, the B2B research firm, projects that the global digital identity solutions market will grow from US$13.7 billion in 2019 to US$30.5 billion by 2024, at a CAGR of 17.3%. The firm further predicts that the market for digital identity and document verification services, a subset of the digital identity market, offers significant potential for growth opportunities, with revenues to rise to US$15.8 billion by 2025. (MarketsandMarkets “Digital Identity Market” 2020 and “Identity Verification Market” 2020).
 
The Increase in Identity Fraud 
 
Unfortunately, with this increased demand for online services and digital convenience, organizations also face another proliferating challenge – the need to improve cybersecurity measures. Never before have criminals been able to access such vast quantities of personal information.
 
According to Statista, over 11,000 data breaches have occurred in the United States since 2005 with more than 1.7 billion individual records breached (Statista “Annual number of data breaches and exposed records in the United States from 2005 to 1st half 2020” 2021). And in the age of COVID-19, scams grew by 400% in the first quarter of 2020, making the pandemic not only a health threat but also a significant security risk. (Panda Security “43 Covid-19 Cybersecurity Statistics” 2020). Digital transformation efforts must address these risks.
 
Identity Verification Impact Across Sectors 
 
Financial services, healthcare and government organizations are confronted by the challenges of identifying their customers, patients and benefits recipients with ease and certainty in the digital world. Governments around the world are imposing new data privacy and authentication regulations, which also impose a “call to action” for many of these businesses and organizations.
Financial Services
 
Financial services institutions are facing a range of digital transformation challenges and a growth in the millennial embrace of non-traditional fin-tech providers, such as peer-to-peer mobile payment apps. Key to this effort is the ability to accelerate the digital onboarding of customers—offering a convenient digital onboarding experience with real-time account opening decisions—at lower costs.
 
Convenience, however, traditionally opposes stronger identity assurance – the easier it is to open or access an account the less safeguards there may be to prevent fraud. Javelin Strategy & Research found that in 2019 fraud losses in the financial services industry grew 15% to $16.9 billion, as fraudsters moved from card payments to financial accounts (Javelin Strategy & Research “2020 Identity Fraud Report” 2020). The study reported that account takeovers—identity theft where a criminal uses stolen credentials or data to take control of a consumer’s online account—increased a staggering 72% over 2018. And with 40% of all fraudulent activity related to account takeover reported to occur within a day, the need for strong customer authentication is critical.
 
Experts recommend that efforts to combat this fraud must focus on moving consumers from static passwords to safer authentication methods. According to Gartner, their clients are increasingly seeking “passwordless” authentication methods such as FIDO2 Strong Authentication to improve user experience (UX) and enhance security by eliminating centrally stored passwords—a key target for cyber criminals (Gartner Research Ibid). Goode Intelligence believes that mobile biometrics are key to securely effecting this transformation and forecasts that over $1.67 trillion of mobile biometric payments will be made annually by 2023, with over $8.7 billion in annual revenue generated for suppliers of mobile biometric technology by 2023 (Goode Intelligence “Mobile Biometrics for Financial Services; Market and Technology Analysis, Adoption Strategies and Forecasts 2018-2023” 2019).

Healthcare 
 
During 2020, remote healthcare services have expanded exponentially - virtual urgent-care visits spiked by 683% between March and April 2020, while virtual, nonurgent care visits grew by an unprecedented 4,345%. (Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association “COVID-19 transforms health care through telemedicine: Evidence from the field” 2020). ResearchAndMarkets predicts that the global telemedicine market will increase to a value of $144.2 billion by 2030, from $27.8 billion in 2019. (ResearchAndMarkets “Telemedicine Market Research Report to 2030”. 2020).
 
Unfortunately, with this shift to remote care, a record of weak authentication practices such as shared passwords, and a trove of rich personal data, the healthcare market is believed to be even more susceptible to identity fraud. Further, IBM reported that data breaches in the healthcare sector had the highest average cost amounting to $7.13 million per breach amid the COVID-19 pandemic (IBM Security “Cost of Data Breach Report 2020” 2020).
 
Government Benefits
 
Many government agencies continue to utilize inadequate identity verification and identity authentication methods. Following the passage of the March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), an unprecedented volume of criminal attacks surrounding pandemic relief efforts exposed vulnerabilities in government fraud prevention efforts.
 
According to USA Today, in 2020, states lost over $36 billion to criminals filing fraudulent unemployment claims under the names of other people (USA Today “How scammers siphoned $36B in fraudulent unemployment payments from US” December 30, 2020). According to State investigators, California paid out over $400 million on 21,000 unemployment claims improperly filed using the names of California prison inmates (LA Times “California’s prisoner unemployment fraud now estimated at $400 million, officials say” December 1, 2020). Much of the data used to identify claimants such as Social Security numbers has long been compromised and is available for criminal exploitation. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), reported that in 2020 they received more than 1.4 million reports of identity theft, almost double the number received in 2019. Furthermore, the FTC reported more than 30% of those reports were attributed to misuse of personal identity in applying for a government benefit, a significant increase from 2019 when only 3% of fraud was attributed to this reason. (FTC Press Release “New Data Shows FTC Received 2.2 Million Fraud Reports from Consumers in 2020” February 4, 2021) 
 
With these statistics in mind, Congress included new provisions to combat grifters when they rolled out a second COVID-19 stimulus package under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. Section 242 of the new Act mandates that State agencies verify the identity of eligible applicants for pandemic unemployment assistance. The Act also provides federal funding to state agencies to implement new identity proofing measures.
 
The FIDO Alliance – The Mission To Eliminate Passwords
 
The reliance on passwords has long been acknowledged as highly frustrating for users, costly for organizations to maintain and reset quickly, as well as one of the weakest security practices for user authentication. The reuse of the same passwords by individuals across multiple sites, the massive data breaches targeting user credentials, and widespread phishing efforts by hackers to entice users to ‘reveal’ passwords creates security risks for every organization.
 
The FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance was formed in 2012 to address the security risks to enterprises and the problems individual users face in creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. FIDO compliant solutions eliminate passwords by using the combination of biometric verification and device authentication via cryptographic security, thereby speeding up and securing user login. FIDO Alliance members include global leaders and household names in technology and across enterprise software, payments, banking, telecom, ecommerce, identity, government, and healthcare (https://fidoalliance.org/members/). This cross-industry coalition works jointly to develop interoperable authentication standards that reduce reliance on passwords with authentication that is more secure, private, and easier to use.

The Global Unbanked Population
 
The World Bank estimates that approximately 1.7 billion adults, representing 31% of the global adult population, are “unbanked” as of 2017, meaning they have no record of credit, or have no account with a financial institution or a mobile money service. (The World Bank “Global Findex Database 2017” 2017). The World Bank’s Identification for Development (ID4D) initiative also estimates that more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have basic ID credentials, with many more people who have poor quality IDs that cannot be trusted or reliably verified. The ID4D initiative aims to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. The majority of the population sets reside in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. (The World Bank “Inclusive and Trusted Digital ID Can Unlock Opportunities for the World’s Most Vulnerable” 2019)
 
The widespread adoption of mobile phones and access to the internet, estimated at over 79% of adults in developing economies, continue to increase opportunities for leveraging digital identity services and online financial services to these populations (The World Bank Ibid).
 
Privacy Regulations
 
All business, governmental and other sectors of society are impacted by the need for organizations to comply with increasing data privacy and authentication regulations. The European Union has lead the way with its General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, widely considered the gold standard of data privacy regulation, and other jurisdictions around the world are scrambling to catch up. The United States has been slow and has only limited regulation at the Federal Level, which applies only to specific industries such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. It is therefore falling to the States and local authorities to adopt data privacy requirements such as the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCP and Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act or BIPA, which are being cloned by other jurisdictions. We believe that this growing trend will impose an urgency on organizations of all descriptions to improve their data security and privacy processes, and we believe that biometric identity verification will be a key part of the solution.

Growth Strategy
 
We seek to extend our position and execute our business plan by continuing to penetrate our existing markets and expand into new geographies and market segments. Our goal is to continue to deliver innovative security and payment services to our customers that help them achieve their operational or business goals. The execution of our strategy is subject to our obtaining sufficient additional working capital to finance the various initiatives discussed, whether through investment or otherwise. The key components of our strategy are discussed below.
 
Add new customers
 
The Company plans to grow its core business through focused sales and marketing of its products and solutions. Our sales, marketing and product professionals are developing additional distribution channels and seeking out new customers. We are leveraging our internal personnel with resellers, agents and distribution partners, who generally are focused on a particular industry vertical and have an existing customer base to which they can offer our products, in addition to their existing lines. Some of the industry sectors covered by our resellers include financial institutions, e-commerce merchants, and logistics. These resellers enable us to target a significantly larger customer base, while maintaining a lower overhead of our own FTE’s sales personnel. We are also dealing directly with potential customers in response to our digital marketing efforts.

Channel Strategy
 
The Company believes that its channel strategy will be an effective way to bring its products and solutions to a broad market in an efficient and cost-effective way. We have signed and are pursuing channel partners, that play a key role in their respective verticals, such as Temenos, a technology provider for banks, Atos, a global leader in digital transformation and Inetum (formerly IECISA gfi) which has a focus on the telecom and financial services industries globally (among others) . These channel partners provide access to their customers, who in turn work with many thousands of individual consumers and businesses all of whom could benefit from the use of our solutions. By entering into agreements with such channel partners and leveraging their relationships, we believe we can expand our footprint much more rapidly and cost effectively, as compared to pursuing separate agreements with each customer.
 
Enter new markets
 
The Company has already entered new markets by virtue of our subsidiaries in Colombia, Peru and South Africa. The Company believes that the solutions that are currently being offered and developed in those countries will be suitable to be similarly offered in other emerging markets in the Latin American and African regions. The Company also recently signed an agreement with a leading IT consulting and business process services company in India. Furthermore, the improvements to the Company’s platforms and the expansion of the sales teams are being undertaken with a view to being able to support transaction processing and customers across borders without the need to establish and build new facilities in each new country, thereby reducing the costs of entry into each new market.
 
Innovation
 
As the electronic and cybersecurity industry continues to evolve, we aim to be at the forefront by developing new services and solutions that leverage our platform and core competencies and thereby enable us to enter new markets, attract new customers and retain existing ones. We also believe it will be critical to our growth for us to continue to enhance our platform capabilities. For example in 202 we signed an agreement with LoginID, under which we have jointly developed a FIDO2 compliant strong authentication solution, which we offer as AuthentifID. We also became a member of the FIDO Alliance, the leading international organization comprising global leaders in technology that help establish best practices for FIDO authentication deployment. We believe the development of new services and solutions will be an important revenue source in the future and enable us to continue to differentiate our platform and capabilities. The Company believes that by using our core technologies we will be able to create solutions that address some of today’s major global market challenges and opportunities arising in identity solutions and access control, coupled with the ubiquitous use of mobile devices. By combining our core technologies, we have built an IDaaS platform using biometric and multi-factor identity solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions.
Select Acquisitions
 
As we have done in the past, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions that will help us achieve our strategic goals, enhance our technology capabilities and accelerate growth. We believe pursuing these types of acquisitions will increase our ability to work with existing customers, add new customers, enter new markets, develop new services and enhance our processing platform capabilities. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions at this time.
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company is focusing its sales activities in the Fintech, Telcom, and Logistics verticals due to their increased demand for remote online transactions. The sales teams are concentrated in the Latam, MEA, and US regions representing what we believe to be the markets with the greatest growth potential for identity transaction services. The marketing team is tasked with the continued sharpening of our external brand messaging to help focus the mission, sales strategy and product development as the Company strives to reach target markets and customers. The objective is to produce industry-specific marketing assets that highlight our platform, solutions, and their role in digital transformation.
 
The Marketing, Sales, and Product Development and Customer Success teams are collaborating closely to develop products that our target customers need and want and to convert prospects into new customers with simplified on-boarding and strong authentication experiences. The Sales and Marketing Teams are also focusing on driving sales and new revenue by developing, attracting, and supporting a partner network of resellers and technology integrators.

Revenue Model
 
Identity Management Solutions and Products
 
The biometric software products are priced based on a multi-year licensing model which is driven by the number of enrollees in the system. The Company provides its new IDaaS platform services based on a subscription model, with tiered fees per enrolled user, or device, comprising an initial enrollment fee, a periodic subscription and where applicable a per transaction fee. The Company’s CardPlus plastic and credentials card products are sold at a per unit price which will vary based on the configuration of the features and functionality of the product, as well as the services provided.
Payment Processing Solutions and Products
 
The electronic payment gateway services are volume priced on a per transaction basis. The pricing for the Company’s new closed loop financial payment platform is expected to be based on a combination of transaction fee and a subscription model based on numbers of cardholders and merchants enrolled. The Company also earns leasing income from the rental of unattended kiosks.
Competition
 
The Company has created an IDaaS platform allowing it to on-board customers who wish to deploy Ipsidy’s services and solutions in order to know with biometric certainty who is engaging with them. Ipsidy’s solutions include the ability to verify the identity of a user, via remote identity proofing, then enable digital access, as well as transaction and device authentication, all digitally signed by the user’s identity. The Company’s platform utilizes commodity, consumer grade mobile devices for customer deployment with users engaging the platform via a web-browser or corresponding Android or iOS smartphone app.
 
The Company also offers certain payment processing solutions and smart card products manufacturing and printing. The industry sectors in which these products compete are characterized by rapid change and new entrants. The Company will need to consistently develop and improve its products in order to remain competitive.
 
In reviewing the competitors that exist for the Company’s current and planned products and platform services relating to biometric identity solutions, the Company considers a number of factors. Ipsidy’s platform approach offers an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) approach which seeks to combine a number of different elements into a single platform. Ipsidy believes that its full stack platform is exceptional in that it provides a combination of SaaS based documentary identity verification, FIDO device authentication, and identification services which cover digital account access and transaction confirmation use cases. The competitive landscape includes several companies that mainly address only one or other area, with some addressing multiple areas independently. However, it is believed that some companies are attempting to create combined identity offerings, similar to Ipsidy’s.
 
In looking at our competition, the Company does not consider providers who do not offer a consumer application solution for smartphones, such as the Ipsidy App. Neither do we consider competitors, which are major conglomerates with vertically integrated cybersecurity companies, due to the vast array of services which they offer. Furthermore, some of the competitors which do offer solutions for digital use cases, are major legacy providers offering hardware heavy solutions principally for governmental users. These include IDEMIA, Thales, and Supercom. This is in contrast to Ipsidy’s IDaaS approach which is based on offering app and browser-based solutions which are usable on mobile devices with minimal hardware requirements. Furthermore, our identity solutions are designed to address the requirements of private, commercial and governmental uses for enrolled users.
 
To further analyze the competitive landscape, the market must be segmented into authentication solution vendors and biometric identification & verification solution vendors. Major competitors offering solutions in both areas include IDEMIA, Thales, HID Global, and Aware. Major competitors offering only authentication, include Twillio/Authy, HYPR, Datacard, Duo, Daon, Ping Identity, Callsign, and Trusona. Companies offering only biometric identification & verification include NEC, Imageware, Element, and Aware.

The Ipsidy IDaaS platform is based on a patent-pending methodology, which combines digital signature authentication and biometric identity verification into a single out-of-band transaction. This provides functionality for our users to have real-time control over their electronic transactions and every-day events through a mobile application, with a detailed audit trail created for each event, containing the digitally signed transaction details and biometric identity of the user. This patent-pending approach of combining transaction details and identity into a single, digitally signed message could allow the Ipsidy platform to be a complimentary solution to many of its competitors and hence differentiate itself in the market.
 
Companies that focused on offerings for ID proofing, include Jumio, InCode, Au10Tix, OnFido, Clear, Mitek and Acuant. Companies that provide a single solution may be seeking to combine with authentication and biometric verification technology providers to expand their ID proofing solutions’ capabilities. The Ipsidy platform offers its own document based identity verification service for use in digital onboarding solutions, in conjunction with our device authentication and biometric verification solutions.
 
Another aspect of the competitive landscape for platform service arises from market demand for SaaS based identity services that are both high assurance and low friction. This combination is the ideal balance that Ipsidy and its competitors are trying to achieve. Companies that are believed to be competing with Ipsidy with their offerings today are Thales, Jumio, OnFido, Acuant, Incode, Au10Tix, and IDEMIA (Formerly Morpho and Obertur). In addition, Ipsidy offers its customers the flexibility to adapt its solutions to their specific use cases for either high assurance or to decrease friction.
 
There are new entrants into each of these markets continually. Each competitor may have a different offering or approach to solve similar problems, which overlap with those of the Company. Some competitors also include manufacturers who provide systems, or platform solutions to third party operators and, therefore, do not directly compete with the Company, which operates its own systems.
 
The Cards Plus business faces competition both locally in South Africa and internationally. China has become a source of imports of card products at highly competitive pricing and some local suppliers are reliant on Chinese card manufacturers. Local competitors include Card Technology Services, Easy Card and Open Gate, Cardz Group and XH Smart Technology (Africa). That said, we believe that we are the only significant manufacturer in South Africa using digital print technology.
 
The payment processing industry has many competitors who provide gateway services, closed loop end-to-end solutions, payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and bill payments. As these types of services are usually supplied by regional or country specific companies, the following summary of this competitive landscape, is focused on those countries or regions the Company is actively pursuing business in today. In Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America where the Company is focused, major competitors include PayU, Credibanco, Redeban, Mercado Pago, Nequi, and QPagos. Some of these companies may on the other hand be potential customers for our identify transaction platform and biometric authentication services. Companies in this region that also compete in those sectors include Veritran, Certicamaras, Olimpia IT, Evertec-Processa and Indra.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company does not need or require any approval from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular business and operations. However, it is possible that any proposed expansion to the Company’s business and operations in the future would require government approvals.
 
Due to the security applications and biometric technology associated with the Company’s products and platforms, the activities and operations of the Company are subject to license restrictions and other regulations, such as (without limitation) export controls and other security regulation by government agencies. Expansion of the Company’s activities in payment processing may in due course require government licensing in different jurisdictions and may subject it to additional regulation and oversight.
 
Data protection legislation in various countries in which the Company does business (including Colombia and the United Kingdom) may require it to register its databases with governmental authorities in those countries and to comply with additional disclosure and consent requirements with regard to the collection, storage and use of personal information of individuals resident in those countries. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in California at the beginning of 2020, and in Maine in July 2020, and other states are considering additional regulations. Specifically, several states are considering adopting a Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA modelled on the Illinois statute, which governs the collection, processing, storage and distribution of biometric information such as facial biometric templates and fingerprints. Several of these new statutes give individuals rights of action to sue violators, which have resulted in a number of class action law suits. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.
