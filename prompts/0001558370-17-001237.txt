     Item 1. Business
     Overview
     Teladoc, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was originally formed in Texas on June 13, 2002 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 16, 2008.
     We are the nation’s first and largest telehealth platform, delivering on‑demand healthcare anytime, anywhere, via mobile devices, the Internet, video and phone. Our solution connects consumers, or our Members, with our over 3,000 board‑certified physicians and behavioral health professionals who treat a wide range of conditions and cases from acute diagnoses such as upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection and sinusitis to dermatological conditions, anxiety and smoking cessation. Over 17.5 million unique Members now benefit from access to Teladoc 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Our solution is delivered with a median response time of less than ten minutes from the time a Member requests a telehealth visit to the time they speak with a Teladoc physician. We completed approximately 952,000 telehealth visits in 2016. Membership increased by approximately 43% from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016.
     The Teladoc solution is transforming the access, cost and quality dynamics of healthcare delivery for all of our market participants. Our Members rely on Teladoc to remotely access affordable, on‑demand healthcare whenever and wherever they choose. Employers, health plans and consumers, which we refer to as our Clients, purchase our solution to reduce their healthcare spending while at the same time offering convenient, affordable, high‑quality healthcare to their employees or beneficiaries. Our network of physicians and other healthcare professionals, which we refer to as our Providers, have the ability to generate meaningful income and deliver their services more efficiently with no administrative burden. We believe the value proposition of our solution is evidenced by our overall Member satisfaction rate, which is over 90% over the last eight years. We further believe any consumer, employer or health plan or practitioner interested in a better approach to healthcare is a potential Teladoc Member, Client or Provider.
     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, there are approximately 1.25 billion ambulatory care visits in the United States per year, including those at primary care offices, hospital emergency rooms, outpatient clinics and other settings. We estimate that approximately 417 million, or 33%, of these visits could be treated through telehealth. We believe that the total addressable market for telehealth in the United States consists of the ambulatory care telehealth opportunity, a subset of visits currently delivered in urgent and retail care settings and care foregone by those currently not accessing the healthcare delivery system.
     Additionally, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or the AHRQ, there are approximately 168 million behavioral health market visits in the United States per year, including only outpatient provider offices. We estimate that approximately 131 million, or 78%, of these visits could be treated through telehealth.
     The U.S. healthcare system is experiencing a growing crisis of access, cost and quality of care due to inefficiencies in today’s healthcare system and barriers between participants. According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, or the NACHC, approximately 62 million individuals in the United States currently have no or inadequate access to primary care as a result of physician shortages. Absent convenient access to a primary care physician, individuals will most likely either not seek care at all or visit emergency rooms or urgent care clinics, the most expensive and often inefficient settings for their primary care needs. These market dynamics impact not only the consumers seeking care, but also the health plans and employers that ultimately bear all or a portion of these costs. A 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics that examined insurance claims for emergency room visits found that over 70% of patients received care related to causes that did not require immediate attention, or were addressable or avoidable with proper outpatient care.
     Innovators in other industries have solved access, cost and quality inefficiencies through the implementation of technology platforms and business models that deliver products and services on‑demand and create new economies by

connecting and empowering both consumers and businesses. We have taken the same approach to solving the pervasive access, cost and quality challenges facing the current healthcare system. Consumers’ ability to access high‑quality, affordable care has been limited by many factors such as physician availability, prohibitive costs, physician office hours and geographic locations. Likewise, burdensome administration, cancellations, reimbursement rates, unfilled appointment slots, geographic constraints and business hour limitations have historically impacted physician efficiency and, as a result, constrained physicians’ income. We believe we have created a platform that is uniquely positioned to bridge the supply and demand gap between physicians and consumers by fundamentally changing the way market participants access and deliver healthcare—eliminating traditional barriers and inefficiencies between participants and empowering them to engage in a healthcare marketplace anytime, anywhere. Our platform provides our Members with access to board‑certified physicians, comprehensive clinical programs and consumer engagement strategies in an economic model that delivers multiple benefits to all participants. The unique combination of these features enables us to dynamically and efficiently match consumer demand and physician availability in real‑time or through advanced scheduling, in various modalities including video, mobile app, web and telephonic connections requested through our member services center.
     Our underlying technology platform is complex, deeply integrated and purpose‑built over the last ten years for the evolving healthcare marketplace. Our platform is highly scalable and can support substantial growth in our current membership base. Our platform provides for broad interconnectivity between healthcare constituents and, we believe, uniquely positions us as a focal point in the rapidly evolving healthcare industry to introduce innovative, technology‑based solutions, such as remote patient monitoring, post‑discharge treatment plan adherence and in‑home and chronic care.
     We currently serve over 7,500 employers, health plans, health systems and other entities. These Clients collectively purchase access to our solution for more than 17.5 million Members. We believe our business to business to consumer, or B2B2C, distribution strategy is the most efficient method by which to reach consumers and deliver telehealth to our Members. We have over 30 health plans as Clients, including some of the largest in the United States such as Aetna, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, Premera Blue Shield and UnitedAd. Health plans serve as Clients as well as distribution channels to self‑insured employer Clients that contract with us through a health plan relationship. Our employer Clients include over 220 Fortune 1000 companies and industry leaders such as Accenture, Bank of America, Pepsi and T-Mobile. We also have a number of health system clients such as Einstein Healthcare Network, Silver Cross Hospital and Craig Hospital. The remainder of our Clients are from channel partners such as brokers, resellers and consultants who sell into a range of small, medium and large enterprises. Over the past two years, we have more than doubled our client and membership bases.
     We generate revenue from our Clients on a contractually recurring, per‑Member‑per‑month, subscription access fee basis, which provides us with significant revenue visibility. In addition, under our large Client contracts, we generate additional revenue on a per‑telehealth visit basis, through a visit fee. Subscription access fees are paid by our Clients on behalf of their employees, dependents, beneficiaries or themselves, while visit fees are paid by either Clients or Members. We generated $123.2 million, $77.4 million and $43.5 million in revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing 59% and 78% year‑over‑year growth from 2015 to 2016 and from 2014 to 2015, respectively. For both of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 82% and 18% of our revenue were derived from subscription access fees and visit fees, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 85% and 15% of our revenue were derived from subscription access fees and visit fees, respectively. Our solution offers our Clients substantial savings opportunities and an attractive return on investment. We recently commissioned Veracity Analytics, an independent healthcare data analytics company, to perform an independent study of several Clients representing nearly 2 million of our Members as of the end of 2016. The study was prepared on behalf of Veracity Analytics and was led by a researcher and physician at a leading research hospital. The study found that these Clients saved $472 on average per visit when its Members received care through Teladoc instead of receiving care in other settings for the same diagnosis. Combined with average employee productivity savings of $46, estimated from data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we saved our Clients approximately $493 million in healthcare delivery costs in 2016. We believe these results are representative of the value proposition we can provide the broader U.S. healthcare system.

 Industry Challenges and Our Opportunity
     Barriers and inefficiencies in the current U.S. healthcare system present market participants with three major challenges: (i) consumers lack sufficient access to high‑quality, cost‑effective healthcare at appropriate sites of care, while bearing an increasing share of costs; (ii) employers and health plans lack an effective solution that reduces costs while enhancing healthcare access for beneficiaries; and (iii) providers lack flexibility to increase productivity by delivering care on their own terms. Market participants are therefore increasingly unable to effectively and efficiently receive, deliver or administer healthcare. At the same time, the emergence of technology platforms solving massive structural challenges in other industries has highlighted the need for a similar solution in healthcare. We believe there is a significant opportunity to solve these challenges through a trusted solution, such as ours, that matches consumer demand and physician supply in real‑time, while offering health plans and employers an attractive, cost‑effective healthcare alternative for their beneficiaries.     Growing Healthcare Access Crisis for Consumers
     Consumers in the United States are experiencing challenges in obtaining access to affordable, high‑quality healthcare at appropriate sites of care. A 2016 study from IHS Markit prepared for the Association of American Medical Colleges found that physician demand continues to grow faster than supply, resulting in a projected total physician shortfall of up to 94,700 physicians by 2025, including a shortage of approximately 36,000 primary care physicians. We believe provider supply is projected to further contract, evidenced by the 2014 Survey of America’s Physicians, where 81% of physicians describe themselves as either over‑extended or at full capacity. According to a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, the average lead time to see a primary care physician across various metro areas was 19 days. Given expected population growth and aging in the United States, the supply and demand gap for access to healthcare services is expected to further widen, placing additional pressure on an already overburdened healthcare system that lacks physician capacity and diagnoses‑appropriate access points.
     This access crisis has resulted in U.S. consumers either seeking care at inappropriate, more costly settings such as hospital emergency rooms, or foregoing needed care entirely. A 2015 survey from the American College of Emergency Physicians found that almost 50% of physicians polled stated that demands for care coordination including emergency department visits are increasing due to increased difficulty in finding or arranging timely follow-up with primary care physicians and/or specialists. In the same survey, 70% of physicians polled also noted that they believe their emergency department is not adequately prepared for potentially substantial increases in patient volume.
     Healthcare Cost Burden and Lack of Viable Options for Health Plans and Employers
     The U.S. healthcare system is burdened by significant waste and extreme variations in access, cost and quality of care. A recent study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that approximately $734 billion, or 27%, of all healthcare spending in 2011 was wasted due to factors such as the provision of unnecessary services, inefficient delivery of care and inflated prices. When consumers are forced to seek care at inappropriate and more costly sites of care, those cost inefficiencies impact not only the consumer, but also the health plans and employers that ultimately bear all or a portion of these costs.
     The costs and associated burdens on health plans, employers and consumers are only expected to increase. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, forecasted U.S. national health expenditures reached $3.1 trillion, or approximately 18% of the U.S. GDP in 2014, and will reach approximately 20% of GDP by 2022. A survey from Milliman in 2016 noted that healthcare costs for an average American family of four exceeded $25,000 in 2016, and have tripled since 2001. A 2013 survey by the National Business Group on Health and Towers Watson indicated that employers bear on average approximately two‑thirds of their employees’ healthcare costs and CMS forecasted U.S. employers spent approximately $660 billion on healthcare in 2015. Despite the significant amount of dollars spent, U.S. healthcare outcomes remain inferior relative to those of many other countries.
     The unsustainable levels of spending on healthcare and extreme inefficiencies in the system have driven an increased focus by employers and health plans to control healthcare expenditures. Governments, private insurance companies and self‑insured employers, are implementing meaningful cost containment measures, including shifting 

 
  4

 
financial responsibility to patients through higher co‑pays and deductibles and delivering healthcare through alternative, more cost‑effective methods. The increasing shift of financial responsibility to patients coupled with increased pricing transparency has, in turn, heightened beneficiary focus on healthcare alternatives. According to a 2013 survey for Prudential Insurance by MRops, Inc. and Oxygen Research Inc., 49% of employers are extremely or very likely to eventually offer only high deductible health plans. As consumers take responsibility for a larger share of their healthcare costs and spend more on healthcare services, they are also demanding higher quality care, greater control in how and where they receive care, increased convenience and more service for every dollar spent.
     Challenging Environment for Physicians is Constraining Supply
     Physicians face declining compensation paired with diminishing productivity due to a combination of reimbursement cuts and an increasing administrative burden. These factors have contributed to physician dissatisfaction and negatively impacted their desire to practice medicine. Medscape’s 2014 Physician Compensation Report shows that 50% of all physicians do not feel fairly compensated and 42% would not choose medicine as their career today.
     In response to this growing dissatisfaction, physicians are reducing access to healthcare in a number of different ways. The 2014 Survey of America’s Physicians indicated that 44% of physicians plan to take steps to limit access to their practices, including cutting back on the number of patients seen, working part‑time, closing their practices to new members, seeking non‑clinical jobs or retiring. Notably, 39% of surveyed physicians indicated they plan to accelerate retirement given changes in the healthcare environment. A study by Physicians for a National Health Program showed medical billing paperwork and insurance‑related red tape cost the United States economy approximately $471 billion in 2012, 80% of which was wasted due to inefficiency. These constraints have driven physicians to seek more control over the way they deliver care to new and existing patients, increase their income and reduce the amount of time they spend on administration.
     Physicians have responded to these challenges by shifting payment models and patient mix. Medscape’s 2014 Physician Compensation Report showed a 100% increase from 2011 to 2013 in the percent of physicians transitioning to cash‑only models, no longer accepting insurance. A 2014 Merritt Hawkins study found that 54.3% of physicians in the United States’ 15 largest cities are not accepting new Medicaid patients. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a single source solution that addresses these physician needs.
     Opportunity to Remove Barriers Through an Innovative Platform that Benefits All Participants
     We believe we have a significant opportunity to solve access, cost and quality of care challenges through a platform that matches consumer demand and physician availability in real‑time and in various modalities such as video, web, mobile and telephone, while offering health plans and employers an attractive, cost‑effective alternative for their beneficiaries through our platform. As consumerism in healthcare increases and consumers and providers become accustomed to on‑demand services in other industries, they are similarly demanding technology‑powered solutions for their healthcare needs. The emergence and subsequent rapid adoption of technologies such as big data and analytics, cloud‑based solutions, online video and mobile applications represents an enormous opportunity for healthcare innovation. We believe the confluence of consumer empowerment, emergence of broad technology solutions and focus by all constituents on providing high‑quality, cost‑effective healthcare creates a unique opportunity for a disruptive platform that transforms the way consumers access, providers deliver and employers and health plans administer high‑quality, cost‑efficient healthcare.     Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe the following are our key competitive strengths.
     Leading Solution and First‑Mover Advantage
     Our solution is composed of an integrated technology platform, high‑quality Provider network, sophisticated consumer engagement strategies and entrenched distribution channels. We have developed a strong brand, established strong relationships with Clients and have become a leading telehealth platform in the United States. Our history of

innovation and long‑standing operations provide us with a significant first‑mover advantage, including what we believe are the following telehealth industry firsts:
    
· | Integrated Technology Platform. We were the first to build a scalable, integrated technology platform for telehealth with an API and multiple real‑time payor integrations. Our platform’s application program interface or API, powers external connectivity with a wide range of payors, third‑party applications and other interfaces and uniquely positions us to be a central partner in the rapidly emerging, technology‑powered healthcare industry. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High Quality Provider Network. We were the first to deliver nationwide access to board certified physicians 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year and establish over 100 proprietary Evidence Based clinical guidelines specifically designed for telehealth. In addition, we are the first telehealth company that has received certification by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or the NCQA, an independent, not for profit, healthcare oriented organization founded in 1990 dedicated to improving healthcare quality and verifying adherence to national standards of excellence in the provision of healthcare for our physician credentialing processes. We have implemented the highest credentialing requirements, ensuring quality interactions and reliable resolutions. The NCQA is funded by corporations and foundations who share its goals as well as its sponsors who, in turn, are eligible to receive NCQA progress reports and access to educational seminars. As a not for profit organization, the NCQA relies on these contributions to foster its accreditation and performance measurement initiatives. The NCQA states that it accepts funds from sponsors only for programs or activities that are consistent with NCQA’s mission and in a manner consistent with presenting the credibility and objectivity of its information, priorities, programs and decisions.

· | Consumer Engagement Strategies. We were the first to implement sophisticated behavioral analytics and predictive modeling to better understand our Members and to drive increased engagement with Teladoc. Our predictive models allow us to identify Members most likely to use our solution and to improve outcomes and serve as the basis of our messaging, which increases the frequency and richness of Member interactions. We were the first to use claims data, plan design and other metrics to influence behavior. For example, we identify Members who have been high utilizers of emergency rooms and urgent care and seek to re‑direct their non‑emergency visits to our lower cost solution. Our consumer engagement strategies are supported by our industry first self‑service communications portals that provide for robust Provider and Member interaction.

We offer our Clients low implementation effort, custom integrations, interfaces and custom co‑branded landing pages, self‑service portals and robust reporting data. Our Providers benefit from our easy‑to‑use EMR and visit queue, proprietary telehealth guidelines, e‑prescribing and a range of other features and functions such as auto‑complete symptoms, diagnoses and billing codes. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Highly Scalable Platform
     Our platform is highly scalable and can currently provide the same level of Member support and response time for upwards of 20,000 visits per day versus our current rate of approximately 4,000 visits per day on average. Similarly, our platform is currently equipped to serve over 100 million Members and can be scaled quickly to serve even higher volumes. Further, our platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services and products, such as behavioral health, dermatology and other services that are currently in the development stages. We have the ability to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions, such as mobile applications, biometric devices and at‑home testing, to enhance our solution and support our leadership position. We believe our highly scalable platform provides us with significant growth opportunities within our existing membership and client bases and allows us to grow with low capital expenditure requirements.      Clinical Capabilities Tailored to Telehealth
     We believe that by directly recruiting, credentialing, training and contracting with our Providers we have built our clinical capabilities in a manner that supports the operational complexity of and commitment to clinical quality required in telehealth. Our physician Providers are board‑certified with an average of 20 years of experience and are credentialed through an NCQA‑certified process. The NCQA’s accreditation process involves a comprehensive on‑site and off‑site review by a team of physicians and managed care experts that evaluates more than 60 quality‑related healthcare standards, including quality management and improvement and utilization management. The results of the evaluation are reviewed by the NCQA’s National Review Oversight Committee prior to their assigning an accreditation level. The NCQA’s requirements are developed with the input and support of health plans, providers, purchasers, unions and consumer groups. The NCQA’s accreditation process is not telehealth specific; rather, since its formation in 1990, the NCQA established, and consistently updates, its quality standards and performance measures for a broad range of healthcare entities by building consensus around important health care quality issues. In determining its quality standards and performance measures, the NCQA works with large employers, policymakers, doctors, patients and health plans to determine areas of focus and how to promote improvement within them. Health plans in every state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are NCQA accredited. According to the NCQA, these certified plans cover 109 million Americans, or 70.5% of all Americans enrolled in health plans.
     Our clinical capabilities are designed specifically for telehealth. For example, our Members have the option to share a record of every visit and their EMR with their existing primary care physicians. In circumstances where a Member reports that they do not have a primary care physician, the Teladoc Provider educates the Member on the importance of establishing this relationship. Prior to every visit, the Provider reviews the Member’s proprietary EMR and certifies to this review by completing a multi‑step checklist. During and following the visit, the Provider may reference our over 100 proprietary Evidence Based clinical guidelines and other telehealth‑specific content. In addition, Members and Providers remain connected following visits. Members receive personalized notes, patient education materials and are able to ask questions of our clinical team via the Teladoc Message Center. Approximately 10% of all physician visits are reviewed by our clinical quality assurance staff to ensure adherence to appropriate treatment and prescription patterns. We believe our track record of zero medical malpractice claims is a testament to our Providers’ clinical quality.

      Well‑Established Distribution Channels and Strategic Alliances
     We have spent over ten years developing sales channels and strategic alliances, which we believe provide an opportunity to sell our solution through trusted partners and are not easily replicated. Our solution is sold through a highly efficient and effective B2B2C distribution network wherein we reach consumers through our Clients and channel partners rather than marketing our solution directly to potential Members. We sell through a direct sales force to our Clients who in turn buy our solution on behalf of their beneficiaries. In addition, a range of third‑parties including brokers, agents, benefits consultants and resellers, whom we refer to as channel partners, sell our solution to various end markets. Notably, many of our health plan Clients also act as channel partners because they resell our solution to their administrative service only or ASO accounts and other customers. We believe the breadth of our distribution strategy allows us to reach employers of nearly every size and in nearly every market, which are capable of purchasing our solution for a large number of beneficiaries, rather than attempting to sell our solution one consumer at a time.     Our Growth Strategies
     The following are our key growth strategies.
      Expand Our Membership with New and Existing Clients
     We intend to increase our membership by adding additional Members from both existing Clients and from new Clients. We plan to execute this strategy by further penetrating existing relationships and by pursuing new relationships through our distribution channels and an expanded sales team. Within existing accounts, we believe our current membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. Our existing health plan Clients and self‑insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solution for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in the aggregate, and we estimate this provides us the opportunity to grow our membership base by more than 50 million individuals by expanding our penetration within our existing Clients alone. Similarly, we have 220 Fortune 1000 Clients, representing a significant opportunity for new Client growth with large employers. We are investing heavily in new marketing technologies and support staff to aid our sales force in penetrating existing accounts, lead generation, new Client generation and implementations. We further believe that as market leader in the telehealth industry, we have a strong, established brand and are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the B2C channel in the future.      Expand into New Clinical Specialties
     We currently offer our Clients access to over 3,000 board‑certified physicians and behavioral health professionals who treat a wide range of conditions and cases from acute diagnoses such as upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection and sinusitis to dermatological conditions. We also currently offer direct‑to‑Member access to behavioral health professionals who treat conditions such as anxiety and depression. We intend to leverage our highly scalable platform by expanding into new clinical specialties, such as second opinions and chronic conditions such as diabetes, and by focusing on expanding our existing services amongst current Clients such as by offering dermatology, tobacco cessation, sexual health testing and behavioral health as a commercial service to our Clients. As we expand our clinical offerings, we intend to further eliminate gaps in continuity of care in order to provide coordinated care along the healthcare delivery continuum. For example, we continue to expand our dermatology, tobacco cessation, sexual health testing and behavioral health product offerings. According to the 2012 white paper from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, approximately 46 million adults in the U.S. suffer from mental illness with more than 11 million adults reporting an unmet need for mental healthcare. Compounding this unmet need, the shortage of psychiatrists and behavioral health resources has become acute nationwide. According to a 2014 Merritt Hawkins report, psychiatrists are essentially aging out of the workforce, with over 70% of psychiatrists 50 years of age or older. Furthermore, industry surveys indicate that turnover amongst mental health professionals is significantly higher than that of primary care physicians and in the future, the growing demand for psychiatric services is expected to be addressed by primary care physicians.

  Leverage Existing Sales Channels and Penetrate New Markets
     We have developed a highly effective distribution network to target large employers and we are committing incremental sales and marketing resources to the small medium business or SMB sales channel to increase our penetration within this market. Additionally, we intend to further penetrate the provider market, notably hospitals and group physician practices, as we believe our solution offers these markets an attractive platform from which to generate substantial income by acquiring new patients and to better participate in emerging risk‑sharing and value‑based payment models, such as Accountable Care Organizations and Patient‑Centered Medical Homes.       Expand Across Care Settings and Use Cases
     We intend to expand our solution across use cases and additional care settings. We also continually explore ancillary opportunities to broaden our business. We believe our services have wide applicability across new use cases, including home care, post discharge, wellness/screening and chronic care. We are also currently extending or have already offered to our members additional range and functionality of our benefits applications, and will continue to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions, including mobile applications, biometric devices and at‑home testing.      Increase Engagement by Our Members
     We believe there is significant opportunity within our existing membership base to increase engagement by continually increasing awareness of and loyalty to our solution. We believe our solution can become the single source for on‑demand healthcare for our Members by continuing to add new and complementary products and services, third‑party connections and other strategic alliances. We will continually refine and enhance our user experience, which is a critical driver of new and repeat engagement and we will continue validating our Member satisfaction with surveys and other proactive tools. We are in the process of redesigning aspects of our mobile application and website to further drive Member engagement. We are also building robust data repositories to strengthen our predictive models and multi‑channel marketing strategies to provide a more complete picture of our Members, enhancing our ability to lead targeted and purposeful campaigns and we will continue to invest heavily in marketing technologies that allow us to increase Member touch‑points. Lastly, we will continue to actively engage Clients in benefit design, worksite marketing and executive sponsorship strategies to drive awareness about our solution.      Expand Through Focused Acquisitions
     We plan to continue to leverage our know‑how and the scale of our platform to selectively pursue acquisitions. To date, we have completed five acquisitions that have expanded our distribution capabilities and broadened our service offering, including into areas such as behavioral health. Our acquisition strategy is centered on acquiring technologies, products, capabilities, clinical specialties and distribution channels that are highly scalable and rapidly growing. We will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business.     Technology and Operations
     Our integrated platform supports rapid and efficient access to, and evaluation of, information from a variety of healthcare network participants. It has a user‑friendly interface designed to empower Members and dependents to remotely access healthcare whenever and wherever each individual chooses (via mobile devices, the Internet, video and phone).
     Our enterprise scale platform is architected for real‑time sharing of clinical and non‑clinical data in real time among the Teladoc constituents, which include: Members, Providers, provider network operations centers staff, nurses, SureScripts for electronic medication prescription writing, routing and fulfillment and health plans for real‑time eligibility checking, real‑time Member financial responsibility calculations, claims processing, clinical summaries and clinical alerts.

 The Teladoc Provider network leverages our technology platform for managing custom visit queues that automatically and instantly route available visits to appropriate Providers based upon proprietary algorithms. Providers use our Internet‑based application or iOs app for viewing their visit queue, scheduling visits and following the proprietary Teladoc workflow for reviewing Members’ medical history and symptoms, documenting the actual visits, e‑Prescribing, if appropriate, and sending applicable medical content with follow up instructions to the Member via a secure message center.
     We use data and analytics to predict demand patterns by geography and we recruit and manage our Provider network to meet the demands of our patients. Our complex algorithms enable us to effectively manage/allocate supply and onboard Providers to meet demand while maintaining one‑hour guaranteed response times, with a median response time of less than ten minutes.
     Additionally, our platform’s external connectivity and easy integration with EMR and outside systems extends its functionality and customer features, which include:

--+--------------------------------

      REST is a stateless, scalable web services architecture that utilizes open communication standards such as HTTP and HTTPS, and has been widely adopted for system‑to‑system communications. Having a documented set of RESTful API’s enables our Clients and Members to access our solution using a custom or pre‑existing website. For example, a Teladoc health plan Client can offer its Members the ability to access our solution through their existing Member portal. Members can also register for Teladoc, complete their medical history, select a pharmacy and request a consult without having to access the Teladoc Member site. All of these functions are provided via the Client’s website that makes system calls to the Teladoc API to process the requests.

 The following graphic displays our robust technology architecture that supports our platform:
    
     We host our applications and serve all of our Members from two redundant data centers in geographically diverse locations. We rely on third‑party vendors to operate these data centers, which are designed to host computer systems that require high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We utilize commercially available hardware for our data center servers. Due to the sensitive nature of our Members and Clients’ data, we have a heightened focus on data security and protection. We have implemented telehealth industry‑standard processes, policies and tools through all levels of our software development and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and third‑party penetration testing in order to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our system. On an annual basis, we also undergo independent, third‑party HIPAA and SSAE 16 audits.
     We have achieved over 99% uptime over the last 12 months. Systems are continually monitored for any signs of problems and preemptive action is taken when necessary. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to a redundant server storage device in a secondary data center. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems and advanced fire and flood prevention.
     We have also successfully grown our business to a level that supports the establishment of two Teladoc‑owned provider network operations centers that we opened in December 2016 and August 2015, respectively. Through these internal operations centers, our employees service Teladoc Members and Clients with expanded customer service and compliance monitoring operations.

 Sales and Marketing
     We sell our services through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of enterprise‑focused field sales professionals who are organized principally by geography and account size. Our field professionals are supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations and health plan and hospital partners.
     We generate Client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target human resource, benefits and finance executives in addition to technology and health professionals, senior business leaders and healthcare channel partners. Our principal marketing programs include use of our website to provide information about our company and our solution, as well as learning opportunities for potential Members; demand generation; field marketing events; integrated marketing campaigns (including direct email and online advertising); and participation in industry events, trade shows and conferences.
     Clients and Members
     Our Clients consist of (i) employers, including 220 Fortune 1000 companies, (ii) health plans and (iii) health systems and other entities. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 7,500 Clients and our services reached over 17.5 million Members. The following is a selection of our Clients:
· | employers, such as Accenture, Bank of America, General Mills, Pepsi, and T‑Mobile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health plans, such as Aetna, Premera, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, UnitedAg and Universal American; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health systems, such as Einstein Healthcare Network, Silver Cross Hospital and Craig Hospital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Within existing accounts, we believe our current membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. For example, our existing health plan Clients and self‑insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solution for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in aggregate, reflecting a significant opportunity for membership growth. We believe there are in excess of 50 million potential Members within these existing Clients alone.
     Research and Development
     Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new services, technologies, features and functionality. Our product development team, which as of December 31, 2016, consisted of 110 employees, is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. In addition, we utilize certain third‑party development services to perform application development and design services. We focus our efforts on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our solution.     Competition
     We view as our competitors those companies that currently (or in the future will) (i) develop and market telehealth technology (devices and systems) or (ii) provide telehealth, such as the delivery of on‑demand access to healthcare. In the provision of telehealth, competition focuses on, among other factors, experience in operation, customer service, quality of technology and know‑how and reputation. Competitors in the telehealth market include MDLive, Inc., and American Well Corporation, among other smaller industry participants.

 Physicians and Healthcare Professionals
     We contract for our Providers’ services through the Services Agreement with Teladoc Physician Association or Teladoc PA, and, therefore, our Providers are not our employees. Under the Services Agreement, we have agreed to serve, on an exclusive basis, as manager and administrator of Teladoc PA’s non‑medical functions and services related to the provision of the telehealth services by physicians employed by or under contract with Teladoc PA. Teladoc PA has agreed to provide our Members, through its physicians, access to telehealth services and recommended treatment 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The Services Agreement also requires Teladoc PA to maintain the state licensure and other credentialing requirements of its physicians. The non‑medical functions and services we provide under the Services Agreement primarily include Member management services such as maintaining network operations center for our Members to request a visit with Teladoc PA’s physicians (our Providers), Member billing and collection administration and maintenance and storage of Member medical records. Under the Services Agreement, Teladoc PA currently pays us an access fee of $25,000 per month for network operations center and medical records maintenance, a fixed fee of $65,000 per month for our provision of management and administrative services and a license fee of $10,000 per month for the non‑exclusive use of the Teladoc trade name. Additionally, we are required to maintain, for our company and our employees, general insurance of at least $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate. Similarly, Teladoc PA is required to maintain, for itself and its physicians, professional liability insurance of at least $1.0 million per occurrence and $3.0 million in the aggregate. The Services Agreement has a 20‑year term and expires in February 2025 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following the commencement of bankruptcy or liquidation proceeds by the non‑terminating party, a material breach of the Services Agreement by the non‑terminating party or a governmental or judicial termination order related to the Services Agreement.
     Our Providers are paid promptly, every two weeks via direct deposit or check. Our Providers bear no out‑of‑pocket medical malpractice expenses when delivering care on our platform. Teladoc PA carries professional liability insurance covering $1.0 million per claim and $3.0 million in the aggregate for itself and each of its healthcare professionals (our Providers), and we separately carry a general insurance policy, which covers medical malpractice claims, covering $5.0 million per claim and $5.0 million in the aggregate. We have not had a medical malpractice claim in our over ten‑year operating history.
     Government Regulation
     The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are extensively regulated at both the state and federal levels. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated Providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In many jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.      Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
     The practice of medicine, including the provision of behavioral health services, is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations and approvals, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care and cross‑coverage practice), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretation.
     Physicians and behavioral health professionals who provide professional medical or behavioral health services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine or to provide behavioral health treatment in the state in which the patient is located. In addition, certain states require a physician providing telehealth to be physically located in the same state as the patient. We have established systems for ensuring that our 

 
  14

 
affiliated physicians and behavioral health professionals are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our Members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non‑reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties.
      Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee‑Splitting
     We contract with physicians or physician‑owned professional associations and professional corporations to deliver our services to their patients. We frequently enter into management services contracts with these physicians and physician‑owned professional associations and professional corporations pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services out of the fees they collect from patients and third‑party payors. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas and California, that prohibit fee‑splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non‑clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine.
     State corporate practice of medicine and fee‑splitting laws vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a Provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our Providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee‑splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our Providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease‑and‑desist orders from state regulators, loss of Provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our Providers that interfere with our business and other materially adverse consequences.
      Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
     Federal Stark Law
     We are subject to the federal self‑referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation and twice the dollar value of each such service and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally‑funded healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.      Federal Anti‑Kickback Statute
     We are also subject to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. The Anti‑Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to 

 
  15

 
induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti‑Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti‑Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti‑Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti‑Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
     False Claims Act
     Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally‑funded healthcare programs. In addition, some states have adopted similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims provisions.     State Fraud and Abuse Laws
     Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally‑funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.     Other Healthcare Laws
     The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non‑governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from 

 
  16

 
government‑sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs.
     In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co‑payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti‑Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non‑routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.
      State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
     There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, or PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Teladoc, our Providers and our health plan Clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the independent contractors, agents and other “business associates” of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI in connection with providing services to covered entities. Although we are a covered entity under HIPAA, we are also a business associate of other covered entities when we are working on behalf of our affiliated medical groups.
     Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. The civil penalties range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for violations of the same standard during the same calendar year. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
     State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may 

 
  17

 
receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
     HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. On January 16, 2009, HHS released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by HIPAA must implement ICD‑10 for medical coding on October 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended to October 1, 2015 and is now in effect.
     Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.
     In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
     In recent years, there have been a number of well‑publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our business associates, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
     OTHER INFORMATION
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 670 employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.     Intellectual Property
     We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States. We also have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know‑how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. Other than the trademark Teladoc (and design), we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.

 Legal Proceedings
 Teladoc is subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. 
 On April 29, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against the Texas Medical Board, or the TMB, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, which we refer to as the District Court, alleging that the TMB’s adoption on April 10, 2015 of an amendment to 22 T.A.C. 190.8(1)(L) that would require a prior in-person examination for a doctor validly to prescribe any controlled substance to a patient in Texas constitutes a violation, inter alia, of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The District Court held a hearing on May 22, 2015 on Teladoc’s motion for preliminary injunction of the effectiveness of such amendments, which otherwise was scheduled to take effect on June 3, 2015. On May 29, 2015, the District Court issued the preliminary injunction requested by Teladoc and enjoined the effectiveness of such rule amendment pending trial. On July 30, 2015, the TMB filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the District Court denied this motion on December 14, 2015. On January 8, 2016, the TMB provided notice of its intent to appeal the District Court’s denial of its motion to dismiss to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which was filed on June 17, 2016 and voluntarily withdrawn by the TMB on October 17, 2016. On November 2, 2016, the District Court granted the parties’ joint motion to stay the trial case through April 19, 2017. Accordingly, no trial date has been set. 
 Business in the State of Texas accounted for approximately $15.1 million (or 12%), $12.6 million (or 16%) and $10.0 million (or 23%) of Teladoc’s consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If the TMB’s proposed rule amendments go into effect as written and Teladoc is unable to adapt its business model in compliance with the revised rules, its ability to operate its business in the State of Texas could be materially adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Given the nature and status of the lawsuits described above, Teladoc cannot determine the amount or reasonable range of a potential loss, if any, though it does not believe a material loss is probable in connection with any of the suits. Teladoc routinely assesses all of its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable and estimable. In this regard, Teladoc establishes accrual estimates for various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred at the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2016, Teladoc has established accruals for certain of its lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings based upon estimates of the most likely outcome in a range of loss or the minimum amounts in a range of loss if no amount within a range is a more likely estimate. Teladoc does not believe that, at December 31, 2016, any reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued would be material to the consolidated financial statements.
     Seasonality
     We typically experience the strongest increases in consecutive quarterly revenue during the fourth and first quarters of each year, which coincides with traditional annual benefit enrollment seasons. In particular, as a result of many Clients’ introduction of new services at the very end of a calendar year, or the start of each calendar year, the majority of our new Client contracts have an effective date of January 1. Additionally, as a result of national seasonal cold and flu trends, we experience our highest level of visit fees during the first and fourth quarters of each year when compared to other quarters of the year. Conversely, the second quarter of the year has historically been the period of lowest utilization of our Provider network services relative to the other quarters of the year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.” included below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
