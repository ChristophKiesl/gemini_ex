Item 1. Business
The Company
AlerisLife Inc., formerly known as Five Star Senior Living Inc., is a holding company incorporated in Maryland and substantially all of our business is conducted by our two segments: (i) residential (formerly known as senior living) through our brand Five Star Senior Living, or Five Star, and (ii) lifestyle services (formerly known as rehabilitation and wellness Services) primarily through our brands Ageility Physical Therapy Solutions and Ageility Fitness, or collectively Ageility, as well as Windsong Home Health.
Guided by our mission statement, “To enrich and inspire the journey of life, one experience at a time,” we employ approximately 10,700 team members experienced in supporting older adults and we are focused on establishing ourselves as a premier provider of services to older adults, which we define as adults who are 75+ years of age.
As of December 31, 2021, through our residential segment, we owned and operated or managed, 141 senior living communities located in 28 states with 20,105 living units, including 10,423 independent living apartments, 9,636 assisted living suites, which includes 1,872 of our Bridge to Rediscovery memory care units, and one continuing care retirement community, or CCRC, with 106 living units, including 46 skilled nursing facility or SNF, units that was closed in February 2022. We managed 121 of these senior living communities (18,005 living units) for Diversified Healthcare Trust, or DHC, and owned 20 of these senior living communities (2,100 living units). As of December 31, 2021, we transitioned the management of 107 senior living communities with approximately 7,400 living units to new operators pursuant to the Strategic Plan described below. On September 30, 2021, our former lease with Healthpeak Properties Inc., or PEAK, for four communities (with approximately 200 living units) was terminated. The foregoing numbers exclude living units categorized as out of service. 
Our lifestyle services segment provides a comprehensive suite of lifestyle services including Ageility rehabilitation and fitness, Windsong home health and other home based, concierge services at senior living communities we own and operate or manage as well as at unaffiliated senior living communities. As of December 31, 2021, Ageility operated ten inpatient rehabilitation clinics in senior living communities owned by DHC, all of which are in communities that were transitioned to new operators during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Ageility operated 205 outpatient rehabilitation clinics, of which 106 were located at Five Star operated senior living communities and 99 were located within senior living communities not operated by Five Star. We provided Ageility rehabilitation services to approximately 17,000 clients in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we provided Ageility fitness services in 199 senior living communities. In December 2021, we closed 17 outpatient rehabilitation clinics that were in senior living communities that were transitioned to a new operator in 2021 or closed in February 2022.
The changing profile of older adults in the United States shows an 18% increase in the 75+ demographic in the last ten years according to Statista, a leading provider of consumer and market data, with an even more significant increase projected by 2030 (up to 49%). With 23 million 75+ older adults in the United States, we believe that this demographic is set to drive significant demand in aging services, and that our business has the platform and service offerings to position us to support a higher quality of life for these adults as they age.
We have long been focused on the delivery of an exceptional experience to our current residents, including quality clinical services, as well as compelling lifestyle offerings such as Ageility rehabilitation and fitness. With the recent repositioning of our senior living portfolio to focus on our operational strengths, and our continued commitment to building our lifestyle services platform, we are committed to provide our customers with financially flexible, choice-based service offerings, no matter their residential location.
We believe that our company is positioned to become a leading provider of residential as well as lifestyle services to older adults. To that end, we collaborate and actively engage with other innovative organizations. We also sponsor and pilot programs to continually evolve our service capabilities to meet the evolving consumer demands of a growing population of older adults. In 2021, we served approximately 22,000 older adults on a daily basis by providing a variety of experiences and services.
Our History
AlerisLife Inc. is a Maryland corporation that was formed in 2001. Until January 25, 2022, our name was Five Star Senior Living Inc. and, prior to that, our name was Five Star Quality Care, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Centre Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 796-8387.
Historically, we were primarily an operator of senior living communities, including independent living, assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing facilities. We expanded into rehabilitation services to complement our resident experience. In response to changing market dynamics, in 2019 we converted 166 senior living communities that we had previously leased under a triple net lease from DHC to a management structure, which significantly reduced our senior living operating risk. In 2021, we announced the Strategic Plan, as defined below, to reposition our senior living management services to focus on larger, lower acuity senior living communities and exit the SNF business, including inpatient rehabilitation services, invest in evolving our corporate infrastructure to support operations and growth and our senior living resident experience to better align with our changing customer and diversify our revenue through continued growth of outpatient rehabilitation services as well as other lifestyle services. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 107 senior living communities that we previously managed for DHC were transitioned to new operators and one senior living community was closed in February 2022. In addition, we closed approximately 1,500 SNF units and 27 inpatient rehabilitation clinics operated by Ageility. We renewed our focus on our operational strengths within senior living and positioned the Company to grow and diversify revenue streams through lifestyle services. On January 26, 2022, we announced the change in the Company’s name to AlerisLife. We will strive to continue to deliver an exceptional residential experience to senior living and active adult residents, while also offering lifestyle services to the younger “choice based” consumer, with the goal of building an earlier and lasting trusted partnership.
Effective as of January 1, 2020, and then again in April 2021 as part of our Strategic Plan, we restructured our business arrangements with DHC. For more information regarding this restructuring, see "Properties" included in Part I, Item 2, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Notes 1 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On April 9, 2021, we announced a new strategic plan, or the Strategic Plan. For more information on the Strategic Plan and the progress we have made with respect to the Reposition, Evolve and Diversify phases of the Strategic Plan during the year ended December 31, 2021, see Notes 1, 10 and 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Residential
Our Five Star residential service offerings consist of the operation of primarily larger independent and assisted living senior living communities, including memory care, as well as active adult communities. Our offerings can be classified into different primary service categories; while some communities provide a single service, many provide multiple service levels in a single building or in a campus setting. 
Independent Living Communities. Independent living communities provide residents with high levels of privacy in various types of apartments and are similar to a multi-unit environment and require residents to be relatively independent. An independent living apartment usually bundles several non-healthcare services as part of a regular monthly charge. For example, the base charge may include one or two meals per day in a central dining room, weekly housekeeping service or access to a variety of activities. Additional non-healthcare services are generally available on a fee for service basis. As of December 31, 2021, Five Star's operations included 10,423 independent living units in 86 senior living communities. Included in this total is an active adult community, which we classify as an independent living community, that has 167 living units.
Assisted Living Communities. Assisted living communities are typically comprised of one-bedroom units, which include private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. Services bundled within one charge usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and eating. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community, as requested, or at regularly scheduled times. In addition, residents have access to a variety of entertainment and wellness activities. We also provide Alzheimer’s or memory care services at certain of our assisted living communities through our award-winning Bridge to Rediscovery program. As of December 31, 2021, Five Star's operations included 9,636 assisted living suites in 118 senior living communities, of which 1,872 units in 65 senior living communities are dedicated to memory care services. 
In addition to Five Star senior living communities, we provide a comprehensive suite of lifestyle services at our senior living communities, as well as at third-party operated communities through our lifestyle services segment.
Lifestyle Services
Our Ageility lifestyle services consist of delivery of rehabilitation services, primarily provided in outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and fitness services. Our rehabilitation services include physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy, as well as strength training, orthopedic rehabilitation, fall prevention, cognitive or memory enhancement, aquatic therapy, continence management programs, pain management programs, neurological rehabilitation and post-surgical or post-hospitalization services. Our fitness services include general personal fitness and wellness programs. Both rehabilitation and fitness services are delivered by licensed therapists or other trained personnel. As of December 31, 2021, Ageility's operations included ten inpatient rehabilitation clinics and 205 outpatient rehabilitation clinics providing rehabilitation services. In addition, Ageility provides fitness and personal training services in 199 senior living communities. We also offer other lifestyle services in certain of our communities, including home health and home care.
Current Industry Trends
The Pandemic has significantly impacted the older adult population we serve causing a negative public perception in the marketplace and increasing the regulatory focus by government agencies. Our roots in clinical excellence have served us well through this time, supported our focus on the safety and well-being of our residents, and compliance with changing regulations, which is all accomplished by our experienced team members. We were among the first in the industry to issue a company-wide vaccine requirement for our community and clinic team members, driving confidence in our ability to keep our customers safe and healthy.
Post-Pandemic recovery continues to remain uncertain, with The National Investment Center, or NIC, forecasting 2.7-7.1 years of recovery for assisted living and 1.8-8.5 years of recovery for independent living. While senior housing construction has continued to slow, with annualized inventory growth returning to 2014 rates, the increase in net absorption has been gradual. However, in general, move-in rates rebounded in the latter part of 2021 and there is a sense of renewed consumer confidence in senior living. We believe that the demand in the marketplace will serve those operators who have been able to maintain operational stability and focus on the customer through this challenging time and are able to evolve to meet the needs of the customer who will have higher expectations around safety measures, technological offerings, clinical capabilities and transparent communication.
Even before the Pandemic, demographic trends regarding aging adults had captured the attention of a number of entrepreneurs, start-ups and other companies in the technology arena, resulting in a steady stream of innovations targeting older adults. Many of these innovations enable older adults to age in their homes longer. Just in the last ten years, the average move in age for independent living has increased from 78 to 831. This investment is causing providers of traditional service offerings to consider new ways of delivering services to older adults. Regardless of the influx of technology solutions that change how services are delivered to older adults, we believe that the delivery of services requires human connection and that high-touch and high-tech environments are not mutually exclusive. Technology can augment, but we believe, will not replace the human connection that differentiates our service. We are committed, however, to continue thoughtful and impactful investment in technology to enhance the resident experience.
We expect the demand for residential and lifestyle services to increase in future years. We continue to implement innovative ways to overcome the challenges created by the Pandemic, including workforce shortages and low employee retention, occupancy pressures and challenges related to new technology and higher service level expectations. 
To address workforce and retention challenges, we have looked to data-driven recruitment processes that use benchmarking and analytics to find quality candidates who stay in their roles longer. Personnel retention initiatives, including increasing wages, have been implemented, especially in geographic areas where competition for clinical professionals is intense. Other efforts to attract talent include connecting to the future workforce through school partnerships and recruitment presentations.

To address occupancy challenges, we are focused on both customer acquisition and retention. Through investment in business intelligence, website enhancements, targeted content, search engine optimization strategy and targeted marketing campaigns tailored to each micro-market, we seek to attract those searching for the services they need for their aging loved ones or themselves. In addition, we are focused on higher quality prospect engagement, beginning with high touch digital interactions supported by extensive sales training that focuses on research-based, prospect-centered sales tactics to convert move-ins from leads through our digital marketing efforts. We are also focused on improving the customer experience as part of the "Evolve" phase of the Strategic Plan. As an example, during 2021, we improved Wi-Fi in 75 senior living communities, with the remaining communities expected to be improved by the end of the third quarter of 2022. We have also entered into collaborative arrangements with Compass Community Living, a division of Compass Group, or Compass, for senior living resident dining services and Dispatch Health for urgent care services for senior living residents, as well as invested in our understanding of evolving customer trends by hiring a Chief Customer Officer, or CCO, in January 2022.
Recent trends suggest older adults prefer platforms that enable individuals to live a more independent lifestyle. With a broader scope of residential options available in the United States, combined with technology enablement, consumers have more choices in where to live and how they will be supported as they age. This wider range of options for consumers is causing further pressure on the senior living industry to implement innovative methods and services that provide for an exceptional customer experience. Our continued focus on customer needs and ongoing investment in marketing intelligence is a direct result of our commitment to that experience.
Competition
The market for senior living services continues to be highly competitive. We compete with numerous local, regional and national senior living community operators. Increasingly, we are also competing with other companies that provide services to older adults, such as home healthcare companies. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and some of our competitors are not-for-profit entities that have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. In recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed, and we expect this development activity to continue in the future as new operators attempt to seize market share in a highly fragmented market. This activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in the geographic markets where we have high concentration of senior living communities. While smaller senior living operators may have struggled to manage the impact of the Pandemic, particularly operating costs, other competitors may have lower operating expenses or other cost advantages compared to us. Therefore, they may be able to provide services at a lower price than we can offer to our customers.
We continue to address competition (i) by focusing on operations to ensure an exceptional resident experience, high customer satisfaction and team member retention, (ii) by differentiating ourselves with the innovative programs and services we offer, (iii) with enhanced marketing efforts and (iv) by evaluating the current position of our senior living communities relative to their competition. Our recent repositioning has allowed us to focus on our operational strengths. For more information on the competitive pressure we face and associated risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Growth Strategy 
We have been in operation for over 20 years. In 2021, we provided services to approximately 16,000 older adults in our Five Star senior living communities and approximately 17,000 Ageility clients. We are focused on establishing ourselves as a premier provider of services to older adults and their caregivers.
We are focused on continually improving and differentiating our service offerings to retain our current customers and acquire new customers. The Strategic Plan contemplates a three-pronged approach to furthering our Company as a premier provider of services that enrich and inspire the lives of older adults as they age.
Reposition: We signaled our intent to exit the skilled nursing business and reposition our senior living service offering to focus on larger assisted living, independent living, memory care and standalone independent living and active adult communities. The reposition phase of the Strategic Plan has been substantially completed, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Evolve: We are committed to a scalable and sustainable corporate infrastructure to support operations and growth, which includes not only robust shared services and technology platforms, but also a strong and differentiated leadership team. Recently, we changed our company name to AlerisLife Inc. to signal the continued evolution of this foundational infrastructure that serves as our platform for growth and success across several business lines. In addition, we are focused on delivering a differentiated customer focused resident experience consistently executed across the repositioned portfolio of communities.
In November 2021, we entered into a culinary services partnership with Compass to transform the dining experience for residents and we also established a strategic partnership platform to enable collaboration opportunities. In December 2021, we announced a collaboration with DispatchHealth to provide our senior living residents access to ambulatory urgent care services in certain markets. We continue to explore and foster partnerships, at both the local and national level, that will give our customers access to a continuum of services.
Diversify: We continue to focus on revenue diversification opportunities in our lifestyle services segment, leading with Ageility rehabilitation services. In 2019, we also began offering Ageility fitness services as a complement to our Ageility rehabilitation services. Since January 1, 2020, Ageility has opened 32 net new outpatient rehabilitation clinics, exclusive of 17 outpatient rehabilitation clinics that were closed in December 2021 in senior living communities that were transitioned to a new operator in 2021 or closed in February 2022. As of December 31, 2021, Ageility fitness services are offered in 199 senior living communities of which 109 are operated by Five Star. We also continue to expand our rehabilitation and fitness services to senior living communities outside of Five Star senior living communities. As of December 31, 2021, 99 Ageility outpatient rehabilitation clinics (or 48% of our total outpatient rehabilitation clinics) were located in senior living communities that were outside Five Star senior living communities. This is an increase from 58 Ageility outpatient rehabilitation clinics (or 28% of our total outpatient rehabilitation clinics) as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we continue to seek ways to grow other lifestyle services that complement our existing senior living resident experience and are available to older adults living outside of Five Star communities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we grew Ageility fitness revenues to $3.3 million or a 38.1% increase over the same period in 2020.
We seek to improve revenues from our existing residential and lifestyle services offerings by making strategic investments in our communities including capital investments at our Five Star senior living communities. In addition to routine renovations and upgrades since January 1, 2020, we have invested $16.4 million in capital improvements in our owned senior living communities and DHC has invested $124.1 million in capital improvements at our managed senior living communities.
We also seek to grow our business by entering into additional long-term management agreements for senior living communities and active adult communities where residents’ private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues.
Through our lifestyle services segment, we provide diversified offerings to older adults who reside in Five Star senior living communities or in other locations, including home health care in certain of our independent living and assisted living communities, outpatient rehabilitation services focused on older adults, and concierge services in certain communities. The therapy services we offer include physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services. The home health services we provide include nursing, physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services, home health aide services, and social services, as needed. In addition, we offer personalized concierge services to accommodate our residents’ specific lifestyle and needs in certain communities. Concierge services include personal shopping, companion services, enhanced transportation, bedtime assistance, and personalized dining and nutrition planning, delivery and consultation. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, which we believe may encourage our customers to engage with us sooner and remain a customer for an extended period.
In summary, our expansion efforts are currently focused on internal growth through effective management of our existing residential portfolio, by increasing occupancy and room rates, as well as by increasing revenues from our lifestyle services, such as outpatient therapy services, fitness and concierge services, to residents of the Five Star senior living communities as well as older adults living outside of Five Star communities. We may also agree to manage additional senior living communities and active adult communities for the account of DHC or other third parties pursuant to management or other arrangements and, from time to time, we may acquire additional senior living communities.
Recent Developments
Strategic Plan. On April 9, 2021, we announced the Strategic Plan. For more information on the Strategic Plan and the progress we have made in regards to the Reposition, Evolve and Diversify phases of the Strategic Plan during the year ended December 31, 2021, see Notes 1, 10 and 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Portfolio Optimization Through Dispositions. We continually monitor our portfolio of senior living communities. We may seek to dispose of, or change our method of operating, certain of our senior living communities if and when we determine it is in our best interest to do so and we are able to reach an agreement regarding the sale or change of our method of operations for such communities with our pre-existing contracting parties, including DHC. On September 30, 2021, our lease with PEAK for four communities (with approximately 200 living units) was terminated.
Expansion Activities. We currently expect that our expansion activities will be focused on internal growth from our Five Star senior living communities plus additional offerings through our lifestyle services segment.
Residential Services. Through the successful execution of the Evolve phase of the Strategic Plan, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to enter into additional long term agreements to manage senior living communities for DHC and other owners. 
Lifestyle Services. We currently expect to continue to grow our lifestyle service offerings by opening new Ageility outpatient rehabilitation clinics and expanding our Ageility fitness and other home-based service offerings. Since January 1, 2020, we have opened 32 net new Ageility outpatient rehabilitation clinics, 15 of which were opened in 2021, exclusive of 17 Ageility outpatient rehabilitation clinics that were closed in December 2021 in senior living communities that were transitioned to a new operator in 2021 or closed in February 2022.
Name Change. On January 25, 2022, we changed our name from Five Star Senior Living Inc. to AlerisLife Inc.
 For more information about our former leases and our management arrangements with DHC, see “Properties—Our Leases and Management Agreements with DHC” in Part I, Item 2 and Notes 1 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financing Sources
On January 27, 2022, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with MidCap Funding VIII Trust, as administrative agent and a lender, or MidCap. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we closed on a $95.0 million Loan, $63.0 million of which was funded upon effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, including approximately $3.2 million in closing costs. The remaining proceeds include $12.0 million for capital improvements and an opportunity for another $20.0 million that is available to us upon achieving certain financial thresholds. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are borrowers under the Credit Agreement and the Company and one of its subsidiaries provided a payment guarantee of up to $40.0 million of the obligations under the Credit Agreement as well as standard non-recourse carve-outs. The guaranty is evidenced by a Guaranty and Security Agreement, or the Guaranty Agreement, made by the Company and one of its subsidiaries in favor of MidCap. Pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement, the Company's subsidiary granted MidCap a security interest on all of the assets of the subsidiary. The Guaranty Agreement requires the Company and its subsidiary to comply with various covenants, including restricting the Company's ability to make distributions to shareholders. The Loan is secured by real estate mortgages on 14 senior living communities owned by the borrowers, the borrowers' assets and certain related collateral. The maturity date of the Loan is January 27, 2025. Subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions the Company may elect to extend the stated maturity date of the Loan for two one-year periods. We are required to pay interest on outstanding amounts at a base rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, (subject to a minimum base rate of 50 basis points) plus 450 basis points. The Credit Agreement requires interest only payments for the first two years and requires customary mandatory prepayment of the Loan on account of certain events of default. Voluntary prepayments made within 18 months of the effective date of the Loan will be subject to a prepayment fee, but the Loan may thereafter be voluntarily prepaid without premium or penalty. The Company will be required to pay an exit fee upon any prepayment of the Loan, which would be in addition to any prepayment fees that may be payable. The Loan replaced our $65.0 million secured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, which was scheduled to expire on June 12, 2022. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility at the time the Company entered into the Credit Agreement. For more information about the Credit Facility and the Loan, see Notes 9 and 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the future, we may assume mortgage debt on properties we may acquire, or place mortgages on properties we own or seek to obtain other additional sources of financing, including term debt or issuing equity or debt securities. We currently have mortgage debt that we assumed in connection with a previous acquisition of one of our properties.
Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations are cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash balances of $67.0 million, borrowings under our $95.0 million Loan, and, for our managed senior living communities, funding from DHC.
Operating Structure
We have two operating divisions: residential (previously known as senior living) and lifestyle services (previously known as rehabilitation and wellness services). Residential is led by a senior vice president at our corporate office and two vice presidents who are each responsible for a division of senior living communities. The residential operating division is further divided into regions. Each region’s management is responsible for independent living and assisted living located in a specific geographic area. Our regional offices are led by regional directors of operations that have extensive experience in the senior living industry. Regional office staff members are responsible for all senior living community operations within their designated geographic region, including:
•resident services;
•localized targeted sales and marketing;
•hiring of community personnel;
•compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and
•supporting our development and acquisition plans within their region.
Residential operating divisions are supported in a centralized manner by corporate teams in the following areas:
•Lead nurturing, and
•Financial operations, which assists with cash application, managing of accounts receivable and purchase order management.
Our second operating division, lifestyle services, is led by a senior vice president and a vice president at our corporate office who have extensive experience in rehabilitation and wellness services and is supported by a network of divisional and regional directors that are assigned to specified geographic regions. 
Our corporate headquarters staff is responsible for corporate-level systems, policies and procedures to support our residential and lifestyle services divisions, such as:
•human resources and team member engagement;
•marketing and communications;
•resident experience;
•information technology services;
•licensing and certification maintenance;
•legal services and regulatory compliance;
•centralized purchasing and cash disbursements;
•financial planning and analysis;
•budgeting and supervision of maintenance and capital expenditures;
•implementation of our growth strategy; and
•accounting, auditing and finance functions, including operations, budgeting, accounts receivable and collections functions, accounts payable, payroll, tax and financial reporting.
As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, we have a business management agreement with RMR LLC, pursuant to which RMR LLC provides to us certain business management services, including services related to 
compliance with various laws and rules applicable to our status as a publicly-traded company, including our internal audit function, capital markets and financing activities and investor relations.
Human Capital Resources
We are a service organization and our employees, who we call team members, are the foundation of our operations. We are led by an experienced management team with a proven ability to manage and grow a resilient business. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and skilled team members to manage and support our operations. Our management team routinely reviews team member turnover rates at various levels of the organization. 
We aim to attract team members who are uniquely suited to be successful in our business and will uphold our values. Our management teams and all of our team members are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our team members must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required annual training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of unlawful discrimination. 
Employees and Equal Opportunity. As a service provider to a diverse group of residents and clients, we are committed to team member diversity and inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting leaders from different backgrounds. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. Throughout our organization, including our Board, we are committed to equality and fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. We have made diversity and inclusion an important part of our hiring process and continue to evolve programs that focus on retention and development. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 8,300 and 5,900 of our approximately 10,700 team members were female and non-white, respectively. As of February 18, 2022, we had approximately 10,400 team members, including approximately 6,800 full time and 3,600 part-time. Approximately 8,800 of our team members work in senior living communities, 1,300 in rehabilitation clinics, and 270 in our corporate office. The average tenure of a team member is approximately 5.1 years.
Board Diversity. As of December 31, 2021, our Board composition was 42.9% female.
Team Member Safety. The safety of our team members, our residents and clients, and our contractors and vendors as well as our visitors is our paramount concern. During the Pandemic, we put in place protocols that comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and other public health authorities. We also required all team members who work in or visit our communities or clinics as part of their responsibilities to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 1, 2021. For a detailed discussion of the impact of the Pandemic on our human capital resources, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial results and liquidity and its duration is unknown.
Team Member Total Rewards. We aim to provide team members a competitive total rewards program that includes competitive salaries and a broad range of sponsored benefits such as a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, tuition assistance, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry. 
Team Member Engagement, Education and Training. Our team member engagement initiatives align with our goal of being an employer of choice with a thriving workforce that encourages career enrichment and positions us for growth. Our recruiting programs, on-boarding and retention programs and our development and ongoing training programs currently include the following:
Team Member Engagement: Management reviews team member engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor team member morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues.
Rewards: We reward team members for innovation and productivity. We have several recognition programs for team members at various levels of the organization. 
Tuition Reimbursement Program: We offer tuition assistance for work-related education from accredited colleges and universities in order to deepen team members’ skill sets and support personal enrichment. 
Training and Development, Industry Associations & Credentials: We offer a robust learning management platform to provide training and development opportunities to all team members. In order to further their professional development, many of our team members seek out credentials or hold professional licenses and association memberships. Examples of credentials, professional licenses and association memberships include: Medical License, Licensed Practical Nurse, Registered Nurse, Certified Medical Assistants, Certified Physical and Occupational Therapists, Speech-Language Pathologist, Certified Fitness Trainers, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation certifications (CPR), First Aid Certification, License to practice law and Certified Public Accountant accreditations.
Communities and Clinics staffing: Our team members predominately work collaboratively in our communities and clinics which have different staffing requirements further described below: 
Independent and Assisted Living Community Staffing. Each of our independent and assisted living communities has an executive director who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the applicable community, including quality of care, resident services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision. The executive director is supported by department managers who oversee the care and service of our residents, a director of resident care who is responsible for coordinating the services necessary to meet the care needs of our residents and a sales director who is responsible for sales and promoting our services and brand. These communities also typically have a dining services coordinator, an activities coordinator and a property maintenance coordinator.
Rehabilitation Clinic Staffing. Each of our outpatient rehabilitation clinics is located within an independent living, assisted living or memory care neighborhood within a senior living community as well as in active adult communities. Ageility outpatient rehabilitation clinics are located in select senior living communities operated by Five Star, as well as in senior living communities operated by other senior living companies. Each outpatient rehabilitation clinic has a licensed therapist functioning as a rehabilitation director or therapy assistant operating as a team leader who is responsible for operations of a clinic, including quality of care, clinical services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision. Each outpatient rehabilitation clinic has services available from licensed therapists or licensed therapy assistants in the disciplines of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech pathology. Therapy services are provided pursuant to a physician’s order with verified insurance coverage in place prior to commencing services. In addition, Ageility subcontracts with external home health providers in senior living communities to provide therapy during home health episodes of care. 
We also own and operate Windsong, a licensed home health agency in Houston, Texas, which operates within three of our senior living communities.
Ageility fitness is a private pay offering where senior living residents receive individual personal fitness training or participate in community sponsored group fitness programs.
Ageility inpatient rehabilitation clinics provide rehabilitation services to SNFs, which as of December 31, 2021 are not operated by Five Star, under the direction of a licensed therapist acting as a rehabilitation director who is responsible for the therapy operations of the SNF. Licensed therapists or certified therapist assistants in the disciplines of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech pathology provide therapy as ordered by a physician for residents admitted to a SNF for short-term rehabilitation as well as for those residents requiring rehabilitation services and residing under a long-term care arrangement. We plan to close the remaining ten inpatient rehabilitation clinics commencing in August 2022.
Government Regulation and Reimbursement
The senior living, rehabilitation and healthcare industries are subject to extensive, frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction but may address, among other things, licensure, personnel training, staffing ratios, types and quality of medical care, physical facility requirements, government healthcare program participation, fraud and abuse, payments for patient services and patient records. In addition, the spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, or WHO, on March 11, 2020, has brought increased government regulation, as well as compliance burdens.
We are subject to, and our operations must comply with, these laws and regulations. From time to time, our senior living communities or rehabilitation clinics receive notices from federal, state and local agencies regarding non-compliance with such requirements. Upon receipt of these notices, we review them for accuracy and, based on our review, we either take corrective action or contest the allegation of noncompliance. When corrective action is required, we work with the relevant agency to address and remediate any violations. Challenging and appealing any notices or allegations of noncompliance require the expenditure of significant legal fees and management attention. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses 
or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, any penalties, repayments or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable laws may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, adverse findings with regard to any one of our senior living communities or rehabilitation clinics may have an adverse impact on our licensing and ability to operate and attract customers to other senior living communities or rehabilitation clinics.
The healthcare industry depends significantly upon federal and state programs for revenues and, as a result, is affected by the budgetary policies of both the federal and state governments. Reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for skilled nursing and rehabilitation and wellness services provided operating revenues at our outpatient clinics and some of our senior living communities. Out of our total residential and lifestyle services revenues, we derived approximately 32.2% and 26.4% from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Specific to our residential revenues, we derived approximately 1.8% from Medicare and Medicaid programs in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Specific to our lifestyle services revenues, we derived approximately 61.2% and 49.4%, from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Out of the total revenues earned at senior living communities we manage on behalf of DHC, they derived approximately 8.7% and 14.4% from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
In addition to existing government regulation, we are aware of numerous healthcare regulatory initiatives and fair housing laws on the federal, state and local levels, which may affect our business operations if implemented.
COVID Pandemic. On March 13, 2020, the Pandemic was declared a National Emergency by the President of the United States effective as of March 1, 2020, and it has significantly disrupted, and likely will continue to significantly disrupt, the United States economy, our business and the senior living industry as a whole. From March 2020 through February 18, 2022, there have been approximately 77.5 million reported cases of COVID-19 in the United States and approximately 0.9 million related deaths, which have disproportionately impacted older adults. Federal and state governments have taken a number of actions in response. For example:
•After the Pandemic was declared a National Emergency at the federal level, individual states declared states of emergency and imposed various lock-downs and executive orders that restricted the operation of businesses, travel, and various aspects of the economy and society at large.
•In 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, along with various states, issued various legal waivers, emergency and public health orders, and other requirements applicable to healthcare providers. These various orders imposed COVID-19 testing and reporting requirements, as discussed below, as well as social distancing orders, infection control protocol mandates, reductions in visitation rights, mandated masking in congregate settings, increased use of Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, as well as other measures. 
•Throughout 2020 and 2021, Federal and state governments established and enforced COVID-19 testing requirements. Early on in the pandemic the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, established priority groups for COVID-19 testing, given that testing capacity could not meet demand. On April 27, 2020, the CDC revised its priority groups for testing, adding long term care residents and staff with symptoms of COVID-19 to the highest priority. As the pandemic proceeded, healthcare providers became subject to widespread and mandatory patient and workforce COVID-19 testing and reporting. 
•On April 30, 2020, President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed, a public-private initiative established to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible.
•In December 2020, the U.S Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued the emergency use authorization, or EUAs, for vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. This was followed by the FDA issuing an EUA for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in February 2021. 
•In the fall and winter of 2020, the CDC and states began issuing guidance on prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In December 2020, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend health care workers and long-term care residents receive the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine when it was available. 
•In late 2020 and early 2021, the Federal and state governments coordinated efforts with the private sector to launch a massive COVID-19 vaccination effort. COVID-19 vaccinations were initially made available to priority groups, and then to the general public by April 2021.
•On April 27, 2021, CMS and CDC reduced restrictions on testing, visitations, and activities for fully vaccinated residents in long-term care facilities.
•On June 17, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, released Emergency Temporary Standards, or ETS, to address exposure to COVID-19 by workers in health care settings. Providers had to be in compliance with most of the standards by July 6, 2021.
•On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced a comprehensive, six-part strategy to combat COVID-19, aimed largely at vaccinating the approximately 25% of the eligible population who remained unvaccinated. His plan included proposals to mandate vaccination or weekly testing for private sector employers with more than 100 employees (which ultimately was not implemented), and to mandate vaccines in most health care settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. Other parts of the plan addressed (1) protecting the vaccinated by, among other things, preparing for the administration of booster shots; (2) keeping schools safely open through a number of safety measures; (3) increasing the availability of testing, (4) protecting the economy, including by streamlining the Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness program; and (5) improving care for those infected by COVID-19. 
•Throughout 2021, COVID-19 variants became of increasing concern, including the Delta variant, and later in the year, the Omicron variant. The variants have caused COVID-19 surges in different parts of the country at different times, which has caused the Federal and state governments to re-impose certain restrictions discussed above in certain geographies at different times. 
•In response to the variants and scientific findings that the protection from COVID-19 vaccines waned over time, the Federal government began emphasizing the importance of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots. On September 24, 2021, FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine booster shot developed by Pfizer, for individuals 65 years or older as well as those with frequent occupational exposure. The CDC specifically recommended the COVID-19 vaccine booster for long-term care residents and staff. On October 20, 2021, FDA and CDC recommended the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine booster shots for all adults 65 years and older as well as certain groups who work or live in high-risk settings, including long term care residents and workers. On November 19, 2021 the FDA and CDC approved the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for all individuals 18 years of age and older six months after completion of primary vaccination with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine.
•The Federal government, in coordination with the states, has continued its COVID-19 vaccination efforts. According to the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker, as of January 27, 2022, of the U.S. population 65 years or older, approximately 95.0% has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 88.3% is fully vaccinated, and as of February 5, 2022, 64.9% has received a booster shot. Further, as of January 27, 2022, of the U.S. population 18 years or older, approximately 86.7% has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 74.0% is fully vaccinated, and as of February 5, 2022, 45.4% have received a booster shot.
•On November 5, 2021, CMS issued an Interim Final Rule mandating COVID-19 vaccines for all applicable staff of health care providers receiving reimbursement from the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Under the rule, all applicable staff must be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022 unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption. Health care providers that do not comply with these new regulations may be subject to civil monetary penalties, loss of government contracts, denial of payment of new admissions for facilities, termination from Medicare and Medicaid participation, and referral to a state enforcement agency for application of its other enforcement remedies. The rule was temporarily stayed in 25 states due to litigation that was raised to the U.S. Supreme Court, however, as of January 13, 2022, the court ordered that the stay be lifted and the rule be enforced in all states other than Texas. Certain states have also imposed their own requirements for healthcare facilities and workers.
•In response to a rising number of complaints and lawsuits against senior living communities, certain state Attorneys General have continued efforts to increase scrutiny of long-term care facilities. While these investigations and initiatives have been related to the Pandemic, they have focused on a broad range of alleged misconduct that extends beyond facility responses to the Pandemic, including both civil and criminal theories of liability related to patient abuse and neglect, consumer fraud and false advertising and Medicaid fraud.
•CMS and the Secretary of HHS have also promulgated a number of waivers, guidance publications, and final rules for SNFs in response to the National Emergency. Among other things, SNFs have been required to submit weekly COVID-19 infection-related data to the CDC, to comply with resident and family notification requirements regarding confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, and have been subject to enhanced enforcement and penalties related to violations of infection control practices. As discussed above, as of February 18, 2022 we no longer operate or manage SNFs as a result of the Strategic Plan announced on April 9, 2021, which resulted in the management transition or closure of nine SNFs we managed for DHC and the closure of 27 skilled nursing units in CCRCs we continue to manage for DHC. However, our former SNFs were subject to and impacted by these requirements prior to their transitions and closures.
In addition, the Federal government took several measures to address the financial impact of the Pandemic. First, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, was signed into law. The CARES Act, 
among other things, provided $2 trillion in aid to healthcare providers, small businesses, individuals, and state and local governments suffering from the Pandemic. In addition:
•It temporarily suspended the 2% Medicare sequestration payment reductions from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. This suspension was extended to March 31, 2021 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Further, on April 14, 2021, President Biden signed into law legislation that further extended the temporary suspension of the sequestration payment reductions until December 31, 2021.
•It established a Provider Relief Fund for allocation by HHS. On April 10, 2020, HHS began to distribute these funds, or the General Distribution, to healthcare providers who received Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement in 2018 and 2019. On May 22, 2020, HHS announced that Provider Relief Funds would be available to SNFs with six or more certified beds that have been impacted by the Pandemic, or the Targeted SNF Distribution. On June 9, 2020, HHS announced Phase 2 General Distributions, including the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, or the Medicaid and CHIP Targeted Distribution. On September 3, 2020, HHS announced details of a $2 billion incentive-payment distribution to nursing homes, of which approximately $333 million was distributed in the first round and $523 million in the second round. On October 1, 2020, HHS announced Phase 3 General Distributions, intended to balance payments of 2% of annual revenue from patient care for all applicants plus a possible add-on payment to account for revenue losses and expenses attributable to COVID-19.
•On September 1, 2020, HHS announced that assisted living providers could apply for COVID-19 relief funding as provided by the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. On October 28, 2020, CMS published an interim final rule that, among other items, clarified its interpretation that the CARES Act provided Medicare Part B coverage and the payment for COVID-19 vaccine and administration.
•It established an option for companies to elect to defer payment of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes incurred from March 27, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The first half of the deferred payments will become due on December 31, 2021, with the remainder due December 31, 2022.
In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Among other things, this Act further supplemented the Provider Relief Fund with an additional $3 billion. The statute required that no less than 85% of unobligated balances of the fund and funds recovered from providers after the enactment date be allocated based on financial losses and changes in operating expenses occurring in the third or fourth quarter of calendar year 2020.
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, or ARPA, was signed into law. In addition to broad-based public and private financial relief, ARPA included a number of measures intended to assist the health care industry, including funding to support COVID-19 research, testing, and vaccination efforts. In addition, ARPA provided $450 million to support SNFs in protecting against COVID-19: $200 million for the development and dissemination of COVID-19 prevention protocols in conjunction with quality improvement organizations; and $250 million to states and territories to deploy strike teams that can assist SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. The ARPA temporarily increased the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage specifically for the provision of home and community-based services, or HCBS, which include home health care services and rehabilitative services, by ten points from April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, provided states maintain state spending levels as of April 1, 2021. ARPA further specified that states must use the enhanced funds to “implement, or supplement the implementation of, one or more activities to enhance, expand, or strengthen” Medicaid HCBS.
Further, on September 10, 2021, HHS, through the Health Resources and Services Administration, made $25.5 billion in new funding in COVID-19 relief available to healthcare providers. Under this plan, Provider Relief Fund Phase 4 payments were based on lost revenues and expenditures between July 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021.
We elected to defer payment of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes incurred from March 27, 2020 to December 31, 2020 as provided for under the CARES Act. In addition, we have received funds as part of certain relief programs provided under the CARES Act. The terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund require that the funds are utilized to compensate for lost revenues that are attributable to the Pandemic and for eligible costs to prevent, prepare for and respond to the Pandemic that are not covered by other sources. In addition, Provider Relief Fund recipients are subject to other terms and conditions, including certain reporting requirements. Any funds not used in accordance with the terms and conditions must be returned to HHS. Receipt of additional government funds and other benefits from the CARES Act is subject to, in certain circumstances, a detailed application and approval process and it is too soon to accurately predict whether we will meet any eligibility requirements.
On September 10, 2021, the Biden Administration announced that the HHS, through the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, is making $25.5 billion in new funding available for health care providers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding includes $8.5 billion in American Rescue Plan, or ARP, resources for providers who serve rural Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, or Medicare patients, and an additional $17.0 billion for Provider 
Relief Fund Phase 4 for a broad range of providers who can document revenue loss and expenses associated with the Pandemic. We have not received any funds under Phase 4.
The terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund require that the funds are utilized to compensate for lost revenues that are attributable to the Pandemic and for eligible costs to prevent, prepare for and respond to the Pandemic that are not covered by other sources. In addition, Provider Relief Fund recipients are subject to other terms and conditions, including certain reporting requirements. Any funds not used in accordance with the terms and conditions must be returned to HHS. We received funds from the CARES Act for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as from certain states. We believe we have met the required terms and conditions to recognize the funds received as income, which we have recorded in other operating income in the consolidated statement of operations. The below table provides the funds we received and income we recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 by program (dollars in thousands):

 | December 31, 2021 | | December 31, 2020
 | Received | | Recognized | | Received | | Recognized
General Distribution Funds | | | | | | | 
Phase 1 | $ | — | | | $ | — | | $ | 1,720 | $ | 1,720
Phase 2 | — | | | — | | | 1,562 | | 1,562

For more information about COVID-19 relief funds, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition to federal measures, many states have taken actions to waive or modify healthcare laws or regulations and Medicaid reimbursement rules. Both state and federal waivers and other temporary actions in response to the Pandemic are expected to last throughout the National Emergency, the duration of which is currently unknown. Additional measures may be taken prior to and after the conclusion of the National Emergency to alleviate the economic impact of the Pandemic. Governmental responses to COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and it is not yet known what the duration or impact of such responses will be.
Vaccinations. In response to the Pandemic, we established rigorous testing and vaccination protocols and efforts. Throughout 2021, we coordinated multiple vaccination clinics for our residents and team members in all service lines of business at no cost to those individuals. Further, we required all team members who work in or visit our communities or clinics as part of their responsibilities to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with this requirement. Consistent with CDC recommended guidelines we coordinated COVID-19 vaccine booster clinics and/or facilitated transportation to sites that administer the booster shot. Effective March 1, 2022 we are mandating identified eligible team members receive the recommended booster shot where legally permissible.
As discussed above, we are subject to federal and state regulations regarding mandatory vaccination and/or COVID-19 testing of employees. These federal and state mandates related to COVID-19 vaccination and testing protocols for employees could have the effect of increasing employee attrition or retirement and adversely impact the Company’s ability to retain and attract employees concerned about the obligations imposed by such standards or mandates. To date, approximately 4.0% of our workforce has left due to vaccine mandates. Depending on the specific provisions of such mandates or standards, we may experience labor shortages or increased operating costs that could impact our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to claims by residents and team members related to vaccine administration by us or the care provided by us following administration of the vaccine. However, such liability is currently limited by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, which provides immunity protections under federal and state law for individuals and entities, or Covered Persons, against claims of loss relating to certain COVID-19 countermeasures, or Covered Countermeasures, although such protections are currently subject to challenges in certain courts. We and our team members who administer Covered Countermeasures such as the COVID-19 vaccine are classified as Covered Persons immune to claims arising from COVID-19 vaccine administration with the exception of death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct. 
Independent Living Communities - Regulation and Reimbursement. Government benefits are not generally available for services at independent living communities, and residents in those communities use private resources to pay for their living units and the services they receive. The rates in these communities are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. However, a number of federal Supplemental Security Income program benefits pay housing costs for elderly or disabled recipients to live in these types of residential communities. The Social Security Act requires states to certify that they will 
establish and enforce standards for any category of group living arrangement in which a significant number of Supplemental Security Income recipients reside or are likely to reside. Categories of living arrangements that may be subject to these state standards include independent living communities and assisted living communities. Because independent living communities usually offer common dining facilities, they are required to obtain licenses applicable to food service establishments in many jurisdictions in addition to complying with land use and life safety requirements. In addition, in some states, state or county health departments, social service agencies and/or offices on aging have jurisdiction over group residential communities for older adults and license independent living communities. In some states, insurance or consumer protection agencies regulate independent living communities in which residents pay entrance fees or prepay for services.
Assisted Living Communities - Regulation and Reimbursement. A majority of states provide or are approved to provide Medicaid payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed assisted living communities under waivers granted by or under Medicaid state plans approved by CMS. State Medicaid programs control costs for assisted living and other home and community-based services by various means. Because rates paid to assisted living community operators are generally lower than rates paid to SNF operators, some states use Medicaid funding of assisted living as a means of lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher level of services provided in SNFs. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in assisted living communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities.
As a result of a large number of states using Medicaid funds to purchase services at assisted living communities and the growth of assisted living in recent years, states have adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. According to the National Center for Assisted Living and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, all states regulate assisted living and residential care communities, although states do not use a uniform approach. Most state licensing standards apply to assisted living communities regardless of whether they accept Medicaid funding. Also, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few states require certificates of need, or CONs, from state health planning authorities before new assisted living communities may be developed. Based on our analysis of recent economic and regulatory trends, we believe that assisted living communities that become dependent upon Medicaid or other government payments for a majority of their revenues may decline in value because Medicaid and other public rates may fail to keep up with increasing costs. We also believe that assisted living communities located in states that adopt CON requirements or other limitations on the development of new assisted living communities may increase in value because those limitations may help ensure higher nongovernment rates and reduced competition.
HHS, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, have studied and reported on the development of assisted living and its role in the continuum of long-term care and as an alternative to SNFs. In addition, CMS has oversight of state quality assurance programs for assisted living communities and provides guidance and technical assistance to states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid for through Medicaid waiver programs.
CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community-based services as alternatives to institutional services, pursuant to provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or the DRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and other authorities, through the use of several programs. One such program, the Community First Choice Option, or the CFC Option, grants states that choose to participate in the program a 6% increase in federal matching payments for related medical assistance expenditures. According to CMS, as of January 2019, eight states had approved CFC Option programs. We are unable to predict the effect of the implementation of the CFC Option and other similar programs, but their impact may be adverse and material to our operations and our future financial results of operations.
Therapy Services – Provider Reimbursement. Our lifestyle services segment, including Ageility, provides various therapy services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. The outpatient therapy revenue received by our providers is tied to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, which has historically been subject to limitations on the amount of therapy services that can be provided, as well as limitations on annual cost growth. For example, in 2006, Medicare payments for outpatient therapies became subject to payment limits. The DRA created an exception process under which beneficiaries could request an exception from the cap and be granted the amount of services deemed medically necessary by Medicare, while the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 permanently repealed the caps, effective January 1, 2018.
CMS has implemented a Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, and Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, which together CMS calls the Quality Payment Program. These reforms were mandated under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, and replace the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, methodology for calculating updates to the MPFS. Starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. MIPS consolidates the various CMS incentive and quality programs into a single reporting mechanism. Providers will receive either incentive payments or reimbursement cuts based on their compliance with MIPS requirements and their performance against a mean and median threshold of all MIPS eligible providers. CMS expanded the definition of MIPS-eligible clinicians to include physical and occupational therapists. APMs are innovative models approved by CMS for paying 
healthcare providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries that draw on existing programs, such as the bundled payment and shared savings models.
In addition, under MACRA, there have been and will be MPFS conversion factor updates. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 reduced the conversion factor for 2019 from 0.5% to 0.25%. For 2020 through 2025, the statutory update factor is reduced to 0.0%. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, further revised the MPFS factor to have a less substantial decrease with such revision expected to result in a 3% decrease in reimbursement for therapy services. Over the next several years, the conversion factor is likely to decrease because of budget neutrality rules and changes in care patterns as the nation’s population ages.
In November 2019, CMS published a final rule that updated the MPFS for the calendar year 2020 and changed other Medicare Part B policies. In particular, the rule continued to implement a statutory requirement that claim modifiers be used to identify certain therapy services that are furnished in whole or in part by physical therapy assistants, or PTAs, and occupational therapy assistants, or OTAs, beginning January 1, 2020. CMS has adopted a standard that, when more than 10% of the service is furnished by a PTA or OTA, then the service is considered to be furnished “in whole or in part” by a PTA or OTA. CMS proposes to base the 10% calculation on the therapeutic minutes of time spent by the therapist versus a PTA or OTA. Beginning January 1, 2022, claims that contain a therapy assistant modifier will be paid at 85% of the otherwise applicable payment amount, as discussed below.
In December 2020, CMS published a final rule that updated the MPFS for the calendar year 2021. Amongst other changes, the rule added certain services to the Medicare Telehealth Services list, either permanently or for the duration of the National Emergency, and reduces the frequency limitations for nursing facility care services delivered through telehealth. The final rule also included increases to certain visit codes, including evaluation and management services. However, in order to maintain mandatory budget neutrality, these increases are offset by a decrease in the MPFS conversion factor. 
In December 2021, CMS published a final rule that updates the MPFS for calendar year 2022. In the rule, CMS finalized a series of standard technical proposals involving practice expense, including standard rate-setting refinements, the implementation of the fourth year of the market-based supply and equipment pricing update, and changes to the practice expense for many services associated with the update to clinical labor pricing. In addition, the rule modifies payment for therapy services furnished in whole or in part by a PTA or OTA. In particular, the rule completes implementation of the statutory requirement that, through the use of new modifiers (CQ and CO), CMS will identify and make payment at 85% of the otherwise applicable Part B payment amount for physical therapy and occupational therapy services furnished “in whole or in part” by PTAs and OTAs ─ when they are appropriately supervised by a physical therapist (PT) or occupational therapist (OT), respectively ─ for dates of service on and after January 1, 2022. CMS defines services furnished “in whole or in part” by PTAs or OTAs as those for which the PTA or OTA time exceeds a de minimis threshold. For calendar year 2022, CMS is revising the policy for the de minimis standard. Specifically, CMS’ revised policy will allow a 15-minute timed service to be billed without the CQ/CO modifier in cases when a PTA/OTA participates in providing care to a patient, independent from the PT/OT, but the PT/OT meets the Medicare billing requirements for the timed service on their own, without the minutes furnished by the PTA/OTA, by providing more than the 15-minute midpoint (that is, 8 minutes or more ─ also known as the 8-minute rule). Under this finalized policy, any minutes that the PTA/OTA furnishes in these scenarios would not matter for purposes of billing Medicare. In addition to cases where one unit of a multi-unit therapy service remains to be billed, CMS revised the de minimis policy that would apply in a limited number of cases where there are two 15-minute units of therapy remaining to be billed. For these limited cases, CMS is allowing one 15-minute unit to be billed with the CQ/CO modifier and one 15-minute unit to be billed without the CQ/CO modifier in billing scenarios where there are two 15-minute units left to bill when the PT/OT and the PTA/OTA each provide between 9 and 14 minutes of the same service when the total time is at least 23 minutes and no more than 28 minutes. Overall, the de minimis standard would continue to be applicable in the following scenarios: (i) when the PTA/OTA independently furnishes a service, or a 15-minute unit of a service “in whole” without the PT/OT furnishing any part of the same service; (ii) in instances where the service is not defined in 15-minute increments including: supervised modalities, evaluations/reevaluations, and group therapy; (iii) when the PTA/OTA furnishes 8 minutes or more of the final 15-minute unit of a billing scenario in which the PT/OT furnishes less than eight minutes of the same service; and (iv) when both the PTA/OTA and the PT/OT each furnish less than 8 minutes for the final 15-minute unit of a billing scenario (the 10% standard applies).
Our Medicare Part B outpatient therapy provider revenue rates are tied to the MPFS and may be affected by these modifications; however, we are unable to predict the impact of these modifications on the Medicare rates received by our providers.
Furthermore, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech, hearing and language disorder services are optional benefits under Medicaid and thus states may choose whether or not to provide coverage of such benefits. We expect states will continue to experience budgetary pressures, and certain states may choose these services to be cut to reduce Medicaid spending; however, we are unable to predict whether such cuts will occur and the impact of such cuts on us.
Skilled Nursing Facilities. Although, as discussed above, we no longer operate or manage SNFs, we managed nine standalone SNFs and 27 skilled nursing units in CCRCs throughout the first half of 2021. A majority of all SNF revenues in the United States comes from publicly funded programs. According to CMS, Medicaid is the largest source of public funding for SNFs, followed by Medicare. For example, nationally in 2020 approximately 53% of SNF and continuing care retirement community revenues came from Medicaid and approximately 22% from Medicare. As such, our SNF line of business was subject to Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, legislative and regulatory actions with respect to payment rates, federal determinations of Medicaid payments to states and Medicaid eligibility standards, and a number of other potential reimbursement and regulatory impacts throughout part of 2021. A fulsome discussion of government regulations and requirements specific to SNFs is set forth in our Form 10-K filing for 2020.
Certificates of Need. As a mechanism to prevent overbuilding and subsequent healthcare price inflation, some states limit the number of assisted living facilities by requiring developers to obtain CONs, before new facilities may be built or additional beds may be added to existing facilities. In addition, some states, such as California and Texas, that have eliminated CON laws have retained other means of limiting new development, including moratoria and licensing laws or limitations upon participation in the state Medicaid program. These government requirements limit expansion, which we believe may make existing assisted living facilities more valuable by limiting competition.
Healthcare Reform. The ACA has resulted in changes to insurance, payment systems and healthcare delivery systems. The ACA was intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, including the expansion of access to Medicaid coverage, and reduce the growth of healthcare expenditures while simultaneously maintaining or improving the quality of healthcare. The ACA also encouraged the development and testing of bundled payment for services models, the development of Medicare value-based purchasing plans as well as several initiatives to encourage states to develop and expand home and community-based services under Medicaid. Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, whereas others took effect or will take effect at later dates. Recently, the ACA has been subject to significant reform, repeal and revision efforts by the executive and legislative branches of the federal government and subject to changes resulting from lawsuits filed with the judicial branch of the federal government. It is unclear what the result of any of these legislative, executive and regulatory reform efforts may be or the effect they may have on us, if any. For example:
•In 2018, the ACA was also subject to lawsuits that sought to invalidate some or all of its provisions. In February 2018, a lawsuit brought in federal district court in Texas by 18 attorneys general and two governors argued that, following the legislative repeal of the ACA mandate’s tax penalties by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (which set the penalty to $0), the entire ACA should be enjoined as invalid. On December 14, 2018, the district court found that the ACA, following the mandate repeal, was unconstitutional. Following the ruling, additional state attorneys general intervened as defendants in the case and on December 30, 2018, the court granted the intervenor defendants’ request for a stay pending appeal.
•In January 2019, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the intervenor defendants appealed the district court’s 2018 decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 18, 2019, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in a 2-1 opinion that the ACA’s individual mandate was unconstitutional, but, rather than determining whether the remainder of the ACA is valid, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case for additional analysis on severability. In March 2020, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the case and oral arguments were held on November 10, 2020.
•On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual mandate, vacated the lower court rulings and instructed the Texas district court to dismiss the case. The Supreme Court did not reach the questions of whether the individual mandate is unconstitutional and whether the ACA should be struck. 
If the ACA is repealed, replaced or modified, additional regulatory risks may arise and our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected. We are unable to predict the impact of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to state Medicaid rates and federal Medicare rates and federal payments to states for Medicaid programs discussed above on us. The changes implemented or to be implemented as a result of such actions could result in the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or private payment reimbursement rates to cover increasing costs, in a reduction in payments or other circumstances.
Enforcement. Federal and state efforts to target false claims, fraud and abuse and violations of anti‑kickback, physician referral (including the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989), privacy and consumer protection laws by providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other public and private programs have increased in recent years, as have civil monetary penalties, treble damages, repayment requirements and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. The FCA, as amended and expanded by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and the ACA, provides significant civil monetary penalties and 
treble damages for false claims and authorizes individuals to bring claims on behalf of the federal government for false claims and earn a percentage of the government's recovery should the government intervene. These incentives have led to a steady increase in whistleblower actions. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to impose substantial civil penalties, treble damages and program exclusions administratively for false claims or violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In addition, the ACA increased penalties under federal sentencing guidelines by between 20% and 50% for healthcare fraud offenses involving more than $1.0 million. State Attorneys General typically enforce consumer protection laws relating to senior living services, rehabilitation clinics and other healthcare facilities.
Government authorities are devoting increasing attention and resources to the prevention, detection and prosecution of healthcare fraud and abuse. The OIG has guidelines for healthcare providers intended to assist them in developing voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse. CMS contractors are also expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third-party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. 
In addition, the ACA requires all states to terminate the Medicaid participation of any provider that has been terminated under Medicare or any other state Medicaid plan. Moreover, state Medicaid fraud control agencies may investigate and prosecute assisted living communities and SNFs, clinics and other healthcare facilities under fraud and patient abuse and neglect laws. We expect that increased enforcement and monitoring by government agencies will cause us to expend considerable amounts on regulatory compliance and likely reduce the profits available from providing healthcare services.
Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our senior living communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed, which could result in the closure of the community and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Citations or revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our management agreements with DHC, and the Credit Agreement or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future. In addition, an adverse finding by state officials could serve as the basis for lawsuits by private plaintiffs and lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which could result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community as well as a related entity.
Other Matters. We must comply with laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable information. Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, we must comply with rules adopted by HHS governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including financial information and protected health information, or PHI, and also with security rules for electronic PHI. There may be both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for non-compliance with these laws. Under the HITECH Act, penalties for violation of certain provisions may be as high as $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million per calendar year. In January 2013, HHS released the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule, which modified various requirements, including the standard for providing breach notices, which previously required an analysis of the harm of any disclosure, to a more objective analysis relating to whether any PHI was actually acquired or viewed as a result of the breach. On December 10, 2020, HHS issued a proposed rule that would modify certain standards, definitions, and patient rights under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to address barriers to coordinated care and case management. The effect of this proposed rule, if finalized, upon our operations is unknown at this time. In addition to HIPAA, many states have enacted their own security and privacy laws relating to individually identifiable information, including financial information and health information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became effective in 2020, and was further modified by the California Privacy Rights Act. We expect additional federal and state legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate consumer privacy in the future. In some states, these laws are more burdensome than HIPAA. In instances in which the state provisions are more stringent than or differ from HIPAA, our communities must comply with both the applicable federal and state standards. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have increased considerably over the past few years, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into several multi-million dollar HIPAA settlements in 2020 alone. The Office for Civil Rights, or OCR, also has demonstrated a continuing commitment to enforce the obligation to provide individuals with timely access to their health information upon request. On November 30, 2021, OCR announced the resolution of five investigations in its HIPAA Right of Access Initiative, amounting to 25 total actions since the initiative began in 2019. Finally, the OCR and other regulatory bodies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks, including the emerging threat of ransomware and similar cyber-attacks. The increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats presents challenges to the entire healthcare industry.
We must also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, and similar state and local laws to the extent that such communities are “public accommodations” as defined in those laws. The obligation to comply with the ADA 
and other similar laws is an ongoing obligation, and we continue to assess our communities and make appropriate modifications.
Insurance
Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies continues to increase, and liability insurance costs continue to increase as a result. In addition, our employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, generally continue to increase and increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the Pandemic, and we expect that these increased costs may continue in the future. To partially offset these insurance cost increases, among other things, we have:
•a fully self-insured program for all health-related claims of covered team members;
•increased the deductible or retention amounts for which we are liable under our liability insurance;
•operated an offshore captive insurance company which participates in our workers’ compensation, professional and general liability and certain of our automobile liability insurance programs, which may allow us to reduce our net insurance costs by retaining the earnings on our reserves, provided our claims experience does not exceed that projected by various statutory and actuarial formulas;
•increased the amounts that some of our team members are required to pay for health insurance coverage and co-payments for health services and pharmaceutical prescriptions and decreasing the amount of certain healthcare benefits as well as adding a high deductible health insurance plan as an option for our team members;
•utilized insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish programs to reduce our workers’ compensation and professional and general liabilities, including programs to prevent liability claims and to reduce workplace injuries; and
•utilized insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish appropriate reserves for our retained liabilities and captive insurance programs.
We partially self-insure up to certain limits for workers’ compensation, professional and general liability, automobile and property coverage. Claims that exceed these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self-insured. Our current insurance arrangements are generally renewable annually. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self-insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher deductibles, retention amounts, self-insurance or other means in the future. 
For more information on our self-insurance see Notes 2 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental and Climate Change Matters

Ownership of real estate is subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to government agencies or third parties for costs and damages we incur in connection with hazardous substances. In addition, these laws also impose various requirements regarding the operation and maintenance of properties, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements relating to environmental matters that may require us to incur costs to comply.
Under our previously existing leases with DHC, we agreed to indemnify DHC for any environmental liabilities it may
incur related to the senior living communities subject to those leases and the properties on which they are located. We reviewed environmental surveys of certain of our owned and previously leased, but now managed, properties prior to their purchase or the commencement of our leasing of those senior living communities. Based upon environmental surveys, we obtained and reviewed for certain of our senior living communities, as well as the results of operations at our senior living communities; we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of the senior living communities we currently operate that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, we cannot be sure that environmental conditions are not present at our owned or previously leased properties, that DHC will fund potential costs we incur in the future related to any such 
conditions if they relate to a senior living community we manage for DHC, or that such potential costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or results of operations.
When major weather or climate-related events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents at our senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living community until the event has ended and the senior living community is then ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as a result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during and after severe weather or climate-related event, and suffer potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.
Concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long-term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in the form of higher charges for our services. However, in the short-term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change and other environmental matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to environmental risks and liabilities,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events” and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Climate Change".

We are aware of the impact of our communities on the environment. When we renovate our senior living communities, we generally use energy-efficient products, including lighting, windows and heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment.
