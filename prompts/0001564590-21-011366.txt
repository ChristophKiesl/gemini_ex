Item 1.  Business
Overview
 We are dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies that improve outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases. GIAPREZA™ (angiotensin II) injection is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as a vasoconstrictor indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. XERAVA™ (eravacycline) for injection is approved by the FDA as a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (“cIAI”) in patients 18 years of age and older.
 On July 28, 2020, La Jolla completed its acquisition of Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Tetraphase”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on commercializing XERAVA, for $43 million in upfront cash plus potential future cash payments of up to $16 million. Financial results for the period ending December 31, 2020 include Tetraphase’s financial results subsequent to the acquisition closing date of July 28, 2020.
 On January 12, 2021, La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including La Jolla Pharma, LLC and Tetraphase, entered into an exclusive licensing agreement (the “PAION License”) with PAION AG and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively, “PAION”) to commercialize GIAPREZA and XERAVA in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland whereby La Jolla is entitled to receive an upfront cash payment of $22.5 million plus potential commercial milestone payments of up to $109.5 million and double-digit tiered royalty payments.
As of December 31, 2020, La Jolla had $21.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for $18.9 million of upfront net proceeds from the PAION License, net of the amounts due under the George Washington University and Harvard University license agreements, La Jolla had cash and cash equivalents of $40.1 million.
 For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, GIAPREZA U.S. net sales were $8.7 million and $29.3 million, respectively, up 19% and 27%, respectively, from the same periods in 2019. Subsequent to July 28, 2020 and through December 31, 2020, XERAVA U.S. net sales were $4.2 million. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, including the period prior to the acquisition of Tetraphase, XERAVA U.S. net sales were $2.3 million and $8.2 million, respectively, up 53% and 128%, respectively, from the same periods in 2019.

GIAPREZA™ (angiotensin II)
 GIAPREZA™ (angiotensin II) injection is approved by the FDA as a vasoconstrictor indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock. GIAPREZA is approved by the European Commission (“EC”) for the treatment of refractory hypotension in adults with septic or other distributive shock who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume restitution and application of catecholamines and other available vasopressor therapies. GIAPREZA mimics the body’s endogenous angiotensin II peptide, which is central to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (“RAAS”), which in turn regulates blood pressure. GIAPREZA is marketed in the U.S. by La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company on behalf of La Jolla Pharma, LLC, its wholly owned subsidiary, and will be marketed in Europe by PAION AG on behalf of La Jolla Pharma, LLC.

Distributive shock is the most common form of shock (Vincent et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2013; 369(18):1726−1734).
 Types of Shock(1)
 
 
(1) Vincent et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2013; 369(18):1726−1734

 
Distributive shock is a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients. Septic shock accounts for more than 90% of distributive shock (Vincent et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2013; 369(18):1726–1734). Shock affects one-third of patients in the intensive care unit (“ICU”) (Sakr et al, Critical Care Medicine 2006; 34:589–597). The mortality rate of distributive shock exceeds that of most acute conditions requiring hospitalization.

Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High-Output Shock (“ATHOS-3”)
 GIAPREZA was approved by the FDA and the EC based on the results of ATHOS-3, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2017. ATHOS-3 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 321 adults with septic or other distributive shock who remained hypotensive despite fluid and vasopressor therapy received either GIAPREZA or placebo, both in addition to background vasopressor therapy. The primary endpoint was mean arterial pressure (“MAP”) response, defined as a MAP of 75 mm Hg or higher or an increase in MAP from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg without an increase in the dose of background vasopressors at Hour 3 (Khanna et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2017; 377:419–430).

(1) GIAPREZA FDA prescribing information (2) MAP response of 75 mm Hg or higher or an increase from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg at Hour 3 without an increase in the dose of background vasopressors

 
GIAPREZA provides the ability to rapidly achieve and adjust therapeutic response. GIAPREZA rapidly increased MAP with a median time to MAP response of approximately 5 minutes. The plasma half-life of GIAPREZA is less than 1 minute.

XERAVA™ (eravacycline)
XERAVA™ (eravacycline) for injection is approved by the FDA as a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (“cIAI”) in patients 18 years of age and older. XERAVA is approved by the EC for the treatment of cIAI in adults. XERAVA is marketed in the U.S. by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of La Jolla, and will be marketed in Europe by PAION AG on behalf of Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 cIAIs are the second most common source of severe sepsis in the ICU (Brun-Buisson et al, JAMA 1995; 274(12):968–974). cIAIs are defined as consequences of perforations of the gastrointestinal tract that result in contamination of the peritoneal space (Solomkin et al, Clinical Infectious Diseases 2018; 69(6):921–929).

11

The use of antimicrobial agents that have activity against gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens is strongly recommended for the empiric treatment (treatment without a specific pathogen diagnosis) of patients with cIAI. The increased prevalence of resistant bacteria makes the selection of appropriate treatment more challenging (Mazuski et al, Surgical Infections 2017; 18(1):1–76).

Investigating Gram-negative Infections Treated with Eravacycline (“IGNITE”)
 XERAVA was approved by the FDA and the EC based on the results of IGNITE1 and IGNITE4, which were published in JAMA Surgery in March 2017 and Clinical Infectious Diseases in December 2018, respectively. 
 IGNITE1 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in 538 patients with clinical evidence of cIAIs requiring urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention who received either XERAVA or ertapenem. The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection, at the test of cure (“TOC”) visit. The TOC visit was conducted 25 to 31 calendar days after the first dose of the study drug was administered.
 IGNITE4 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, active controlled study in 499 patients with clinical evidence of cIAIs requiring urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention who received either XERAVA or meropenem. The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection, at the TOC visit. The TOC visit was conducted 25 to 31 calendar days after the first dose of the study drug was administered.

Product Candidates
 In connection with the acquisition of Tetraphase, we acquired the following product candidates that are in early stage clinical or preclinical development: (1) TP-6076, an IV formulation of a fully synthetic fluorocycline derivative for the treatment of certain multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria; (2) TP-271, an IV and oral formulation of a fully synthetic fluorocycline for the treatment of respiratory disease caused by bacterial biothreat and antibiotic-resistant public health pathogens, as well as bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia; and (3) TP-2846, an IV formulation of a tetracycline for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. At this time, there are no active studies nor anticipated future studies for any of these product candidates. We intend to seek out-licensing opportunities for these product candidates; however, at this time, we are unable to predict the likelihood of successfully out-licensing any of these product candidates.
Sales and Marketing Organization
 La Jolla employs an experienced sales and marketing team dedicated to the commercialization of GIAPREZA and XERAVA. As of December 31, 2020, this team consisted of 39 professionals, including 29 critical care specialists.
Customers
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, 521 hospitals in the U.S. purchased GIAPREZA. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 750 hospitals and other healthcare organizations in the U.S. purchased XERAVA. Hospitals and other healthcare organizations purchase our products through a network of specialty and wholesale distributors. We do not believe that the loss of any one of these distributors would significantly impact our ability to distribute GIAPREZA or XERAVA, as we expect that sales volume would be absorbed by the remaining distributors. Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for GIAPREZA and XERAVA, backlog is not material to our business.
Competition
 Catecholamines (primarily norepinephrine), which are available as generics and inexpensive, are typically used first line to treat distributive shock, while Vasostrict® (Endo International plc) is typically used second line. In the randomized, Phase 3 study ATHOS-3, GIAPREZA demonstrated clinical benefit in patients who were not adequately responding to available vasopressors, including catecholamines and Vasostrict. GIAPREZA’s principal competition as a treatment in patients not adequately responding to available vasopressors is the use of these same vasopressors, particularly norepinephrine, at increased doses. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for GIAPREZA will be limited, and our business will suffer.
 XERAVA competes with a number of antibiotics that are currently marketed for the treatment of cIAI and other multidrug resistant infections, including: AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam, marketed by AbbVie Inc.); MERREM IV® (meropenem, marketed by AstraZeneca PLC); PRIMAXIN® (imipenem and cilastatin, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); RECARBRIO™ (imipenem, cilastatin, and relebactam, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); TYGACIL® (tigecycline, marketed by Pfizer Inc.); VABOMERE™ (meropenem and vaborbactam, marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.); ZERBAXA® (ceftolozane and tazobactam, marketed by Merck & Co., Inc.); ZOSYN® (piperacillin and tazobactam, marketed by Pfizer Inc.); and current and future generic versions of marketed antibiotics. If we are unable to successfully change treatment practices, the commercial prospects for XERAVA will be limited, and our business will suffer.

18

Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of GIAPREZA or XERAVA. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce GIAPREZA and XERAVA and expect to continue to do so to meet our development and commercial needs. In all of our manufacturing agreements, we require that contract manufacturers produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) and drug products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain confidentiality agreements with potential and existing manufacturers in order to protect our proprietary rights related to GIAPREZA and XERAVA. The long-term commercial success of GIAPREZA and XERAVA will depend in part on the ability of our contract manufacturers to supply cGMP-compliant API and drug product without interruption.
Regulatory Exclusivity
 GIAPREZA and XERAVA are New Chemical Entities (“NCEs”) approved by the FDA. In the U.S., NCEs approved by the FDA are eligible for market exclusivity under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which can prevent the approval of generic versions of the NCE for 5 to 7.5 years from the date of the initial approval of the NCE. Specifically, the FDCA provides a 5-year period of marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the applicant that gains approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all of the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted 4 years after the NDA approval of the NCE if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. This certification will trigger an automatic stay in the approval of any generic competition until the earlier of: (a) 30 months from the certification; or (b) a court ruling of patent invalidity or non-infringement for the relevant patents. In the absence of a court ruling, the 30-month stay will be extended by such amount of time (if any) that is required for 7.5 years to have elapsed from the date of NDA approval of the NCE.
 Under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (“GAIN”) provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), the FDA may designate a product as a qualified infectious disease product (“QIDP”). In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections. We obtained a QIDP designation for the IV formulation of XERAVA for cIAI in July 2013. Upon approving an application for a QIDP, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for an NCE. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded. XERAVA has been awarded this five-year exclusivity under FDASIA.

Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. As of February 19, 2021, the intellectual property portfolio relating to GIAPREZA included 12 issued U.S. patents, 8 pending U.S. patent applications, 8 issued foreign patents, 45 pending foreign patent applications, and 1 international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”). The issued U.S. patents, and patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications, will expire between 2029 and 2038, absent any disclaimers, extensions, or adjustments of patent term. The foreign patents, and patents that may issue from the pending foreign patent applications, will expire between 2034 and 2037, absent any disclaimers, extensions, or adjustments of patent term. Patents that may issue from applications claiming priority to the PCT application will expire in 2040, absent any disclaimers, extensions, or adjustments of patent term.
 As of February 19, 2021, we owned 2 issued U.S. patents, 1 pending U.S. patent application, 17 issued foreign patents and 5 pending foreign patent applications relating to XERAVA. The issued U.S. patents, and the patent that may issue from the pending U.S. patent application, will have an expiration date of August 7, 2029, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term. The term of one of the U.S. patents has received 508 days of patent term adjustment. The foreign patents, and patents that may issue from the pending foreign applications, will likewise have an expiration date of August 7, 2029, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term.
 As of February 19, 2021, we also filed applications for Supplementary Protection Certificates based on European Patent No. 2323972 covering the composition of matter and use of XERAVA. Some applications have been granted and others are pending.
 As of February 19, 2021, we also owned 1 pending U.S. patent application and 10 pending foreign patent applications that relate to crystalline forms of eravacycline. Any U.S. patent that may issue from the pending patent application will expire in 2037 absent any disclaimers, extensions, or adjustments of patent term. Likewise, any foreign patents that may issue from the pending foreign patent applications will expire in 2037.

Government Regulation
 Pharmaceutical products, including GIAPREZA and XERAVA, are subject to extensive government regulation. In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, research and development activities, manufacturing, quality, storage, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, there is a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs and ongoing oversight of marketed products. We may also be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical studies and drug products if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside of the U.S. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Regulation in the U.S.
 The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. We cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will ever obtain approval. The FDA approval process for new drugs includes, without limitation:
  
• | preclinical studies;
--+---------------------


• | submission in the U.S. of an IND for clinical studies conducted in the U.S.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to establish safety and efficacy of the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review and approval of an NDA in the U.S.; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. Even after regulatory approval is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown safety risks, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. Drugs may only be marketed in a manner consistent with their FDA-approved labeling. Approval may be subject to post-marketing surveillance and other record-keeping and reporting obligations. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 The failure to comply with FDA’s requirements may result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, refusals to review pending product applications, refusals to permit the import or export of products, seizures, injunctions, and civil and criminal penalties.
 Third-party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the U.S. and most major foreign markets, drugs like GIAPREZA and XERAVA that are administered in the hospital must be purchased by the hospital and generally are not reimbursed by third-party payors. Hospitals instead are reimbursed for patient cases based on patients’ diagnosed conditions under the U.S. Medicare diagnosis-related group (“DRG”) system or other like systems for non-Medicare patients in the U.S. and in most major foreign markets. Adoption of new drugs that are administered in the hospital generally occurs more slowly than adoption of new drugs that are taken on an outpatient basis, which generally are paid for by third-party payors.
 21

U.S. Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
 We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the health care industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, cash payments, donations, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service or compensation for something other than fair market value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we may not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws in a variety of ways. These include: providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers; improperly promoting a product’s off-label use; violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or misreporting pricing information to government programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of GIAPREZA, XERAVA or future products. For example, clinical studies conducted in the European Union must be done under a clinical trial application (“CTA”), which is usually supported by an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (“IMPD”), and the oversight of ethics committees. If we market GIAPREZA in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. Foreign regulatory approval processes involve many of the risks associated with FDA marketing approval discussed above. There is no assurance that any FDA approval of any of our product candidates will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa. The process for clinical studies in the European Union and other countries is similar, and studies are heavily scrutinized by the designated ethics committees and regulatory authorities. In addition, foreign regulations may include applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to health care professionals and entities.
 In Europe, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) (“GDPR”) contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information. The GDPR provides for potentially significant sanctions and contains extraterritoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. In addition to the GDPR, individual countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world have enacted similar data privacy legislation. This legislation imposes increased compliance obligations and regulatory risk, including the potential for significant fines for noncompliance.
 Other Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the regulations of the Nasdaq Capital Market, on which our shares of common stock are traded. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 59 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We also hire consultants and contract with third parties, as needed, to provide additional resources to support our business activities.
 Our key human capital management objectives are to identify, recruit, integrate, retain and motivate our new and existing employees. We believe that our compensation and benefit programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain qualified talent. Employees receive an annual base salary and are eligible to earn performance-based cash bonuses. To create and maintain a successful work environment, we offer a comprehensive package of additional benefits that support the physical and mental health and wellness of all of our employees and their families. Additionally, we grant equity awards in order to allow for directors, officers, employees and consultants of La Jolla to share in the performance of the Company.
