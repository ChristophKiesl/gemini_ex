ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Background
 
Empire Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in the State of Utah in August 1983 under the name Chambers Energy Corporation and domesticated in Delaware in March 1985 under the name Americomm Corporation.  The name was changed to Americomm Resources Corporation in July 1995.  On May 29, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation acquired Empire Petroleum Corporation, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Americomm Resources Corporation.  On August 15, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation and Empire Petroleum Corporation merged and the resulting entity's name was changed to Empire Petroleum Corporation. Empire Petroleum Corporation has four wholly owned subsidiaries, Empire Texas LLC (“Empire Texas”), Empire Louisiana LLC (“Empire Louisiana”), Empire New Mexico LLC (Empire New Mexico”), and Empire North Dakota LLC (“Empire North Dakota”). The consolidated financial statements of Empire Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries ("Empire", the "Company", "we") include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Business and Properties
 
On April 6, 2020, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Empire Texas, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Pardus Oil & Gas, LLC and Pardus Oil & Gas Operating GP, LLC (collectively the “Seller”) to purchase certain oil and natural gas properties in Texas comprising 139 gross wells and approximately 30,000 net acres, 77.3 miles of gathering lines and pipelines and related facilities and equipment, and all general and limited partner interest in Pardus Oil & Gas Operating, LP. The purchase price, as amended, included the assumption of certain obligations and a cash payment of $40,000. The transaction closed April 7, 2020.
 
On August 6, 2020, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Empire Texas, entered into a joint development agreement (the “Agreement”) with Petroleum & Independent Exploration, LLC and related entities (“PIE”). Under the terms of the Agreement, PIE will perform recompletion or workover on specified mutually agreed upon wells (“Workover Wells”) owned by the Company. To fund the work, PIE entered into a term loan agreement with the Company, dated August 1, 2020, whereby PIE will loan up to $2,000,000, at an interest rate of 6% per annum, maturing August 7, 2024 unless terminated earlier by PIE. Proceeds of the loan will be used for recompletion or workover of the Workover Wells. As part of the Agreement, the Company assigned to PIE a combined 85% working and revenue interest in the Workover Wells. Of the assigned interest, 70% working and revenue interest will be used to repay the obligations under the term loan agreement. Once the term loan is repaid, PIE will reassign a 35% working and revenue interest to the Company in each of the Workover Wells and retain a 50% working and revenue interest.
 
On March 28, 2019, the Company purchased oil producing properties from EnergyQuest II, LLC ("EnergyQuest") for a purchase price of $5,418,653. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2019. After certain adjustments related to the effective date, the total proceeds paid to EnergyQuest were $5,646,126.  Such proceeds were paid from borrowing on notes payable and sales of unregistered securities of the Company.
 
The oil and natural gas properties purchased from EnergyQuest included 184 wells in Montana and North Dakota, and Empire operates 139 of such wells.
 
All of the Company’s producing properties are located in Louisiana, Texas, North Dakota, and Montana. For 2020, the properties produced approximately 515 net barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day.
 
Marketing Arrangements
 
We market our oil and natural gas in accordance with standard energy industry practices. The marketing effort endeavors to obtain the combined highest netback and most secure market available at that time.
 
We sell production at the lease locations to third-party purchasers via truck transport. We do not transport, refine or process the oil we produce. We sell our produced oil under contracts using market-based pricing, which is adjusted for differentials based upon oil quality.
 
We sell our natural gas under natural gas purchase contracts using market-based pricing, which is sold at the lease location.

Principal Customers
 
We sell our oil and natural gas production to marketers that transport such production by truck to storage facilities arranged by the marketers. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted.
 
For 2020, revenues from oil and natural gas sales to four customers accounted for 95% of our total operating revenues. For 2019, three customers accounted for 96% of total operating revenue. While the loss of these purchasers may result in a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our production, we believe that the loss of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing region.
 
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry in the areas in which we operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent producers to major integrated companies. We primarily encounter significant competition in acquiring properties. At higher commodity prices, we also face competition in contracting for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial, technical and personnel resources substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
 
In addition to competition for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment, we are also affected by the availability of related equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay drilling, workover and exploration activities and cause significant price increases. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such shortages.
 
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
 
The estimates of our proved reserves at December 31, 2020, all of which were located in the United States, were based on evaluations prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”).
 
The following table represents the Company’s oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2020.
 

 | Oil | Natural Gas 
-------------------+----------+----------------
 | (Mbbl) | (MMcf) 
Proved developed | 3,330.92 | 939.70 
Proved behind pipe | 85.19 | — 
Proved shut in | 244.48 | 31.08 
Total Proved | 3,660.59 | 970.78 

Markets; Price Volatility
 
The market price of oil and gas is volatile, subject to speculative movement and depends upon numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including expectations regarding inflation, global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs. Future profitability, if any, will depend substantially upon the prevailing prices for oil and gas.  If the market price for oil and gas remains depressed in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to raise additional capital necessary to finance operations. Lower oil and gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas, if any, that can be produced economically from the Company's properties.  The Company anticipates that the prices of oil and gas will fluctuate in the near future.

Regulation
 
The oil and gas industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the production, transportation and sale of hydrocarbons as well as the taxation of income resulting therefrom.
 
Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is constantly changing.  Numerous federal and state departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry.  In general, these rules and regulations regulate, among other things, the extent to which acreage may be acquired or relinquished; spacing of wells; measures required for preventing waste of oil and gas resources; and, in some cases, rates of production.  The heavy and increasing regulatory burdens on the oil and gas industry increase the Company's cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability.
 
The oil and gas operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites.  These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities if the Company fails to comply or if any contamination results from the Company's operations.
 
Employees
 
The Company has eleven full-time employees.   Thomas Pritchard serves as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Michael Morrisett serves as the Company’s President.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company compensated Mr. Morrisett $514,417 and $238,450 respectively, for services rendered as President. The Company compensated Mr. Pritchard $514,417 and $242,450 in 2020 and 2019 respectively for services rendered as Chief Executive Officer.
