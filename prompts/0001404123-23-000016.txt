Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to transform health care for all through our human-centered, technology-powered model. Our vision is to delight millions of members with better health and better care while reducing the total cost of care. We are a membership-based primary care platform with seamless digital health and inviting in-office care, convenient to where people work, shop, live, and click. We are disrupting health care from within the existing ecosystem by simultaneously addressing the frustrations and unmet needs of key stakeholders, which include consumers, employers, providers, and health networks. As of December 31, 2022, we have grown to approximately 836,000 total members including 796,000 Consumer and Enterprise members and 40,000 At-Risk members, and we operated 221 medical offices in 27 markets across the United States.
The current state of the healthcare ecosystem leaves key stakeholders frustrated and with unmet needs.
•Consumers. According to a 2020 report, 71% of consumers are dissatisfied with their healthcare experience, in part due to limited after-hours and digital access, long wait times for appointments, extended in-office delays, short and impersonal visits, uninviting medical offices in inconvenient locations, constrained access to specialists, and a lack of care coordination across clinical settings.
•Employers. Employers find their health benefit offerings often underperforming on such fundamental objectives as attracting and engaging employees, improving employee productivity, reducing absenteeism, producing better health outcomes, increasing the safety of the workplace through screening and treating communicable diseases such as COVID-19, or managing health care costs.
•Providers. Within primary care, according to a 2022 Mayo Clinic report, 63% of U.S. physicians show symptoms of burnout, driven in part by misaligned fee-for-service compensation approaches incentivizing short transactional interactions, and excessive administrative tasks associated with burdensome electronic health record ("EHR") systems, and convoluted insurance procedures.
•Health Networks. Health systems, as well as private and government payers, have been looking to develop coordinated networks of care to better attract patients, increase attributable lives, and better integrate primary care with specialty services for improved patient outcomes and lower costs. Yet even with major investments in provider groups, care management programs and technology systems, health networks have struggled to deliver on these objectives.
The U.S. commercial primary care and Medicare market together is estimated to be approximately $870 billion in 2021, including approximately $170 billion for the commercially insured population and $700 billion for the Medicare population. We estimate that the 27 markets in which we are physically present plus the two markets we are planning to launch in 2023 represent approximately $55 billion in primary care spend within the commercially insured population, and $220 billion for the Medicare population. We expect our total addressable market to grow as we further expand into additional geographies, offer additional services, serve additional populations, and explore alternative risk-sharing reimbursement models. For example, we believe we can further expand our physical presence across the United States. The 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. represent an estimated market opportunity of approximately $80 billion within the commercially insured population, and $330 billion for the Medicare population. In addition, some employees of our enterprise customers can access our digital services nationally, providing us with additional growth potential and improving our ability to expand our physical footprint. 
We have developed a modernized healthcare membership model based on direct consumer enrollment and third-party sponsorship across commercially insured and Medicare populations. Our membership model includes seamless access to 24/7 digital health services paired with inviting in-office care routinely covered by most health care payers. Our technology drives high monthly active usage within our membership, promoting ongoing and longitudinal patient relationships for better health outcomes, and high member retention. Our technology also helps our service-minded team in building trust and rapport with our members by facilitating proactive digital health outreach as well as responsive on-demand virtual and in-office care. Our digital health services and our well-appointed offices, which tend to be located in highly convenient locations, are staffed by a team of clinicians who are not paid on a fee-for-service basis, and therefore free of misaligned compensation incentives prevalent in health care. Additionally, we have developed clinically and digitally integrated partnerships with health networks, better coordinating more timely access to specialty care when needed by members. Together, this approach allows us to engage 
in value-based care across all age groups, including through At-Risk arrangements with Medicare Advantage payers and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), in which One Medical is responsible for managing a range of healthcare services and associated costs of our members. 
•Consumers. We delight consumers with a superior experience as evidenced by our average Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 90 across our membership base over the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and our key primary care-related Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ("HEDIS") quality measures. NPS measures the willingness of consumers to recommend a company's products or services to others. We use NPS as a proxy for gauging our members' overall satisfaction with us or our providers and loyalty to us. We calculate our NPS based on survey data using the standard method of subtracting the percentage of members who respond that they are not likely to recommend us or our providers from the percentage of members that respond that they are likely to recommend our providers, with responses based on a scale of 0 to 10. The resulting NPS is an index that ranges from a low of -100 to a high of 100.
Our technology platforms advance consumer engagement and health through proactive digital health screenings, post-visit digital follow-ups, real-time access to medical records, and around-the-clock availability of our friendly and knowledgeable providers. Our technology platforms also provide insights for our care teams across our populations that aid in our care delivery.
Our members receive access to 24/7 on-demand digital and virtual health services with quick response times. Members also have access to scheduled virtual visits as well as inviting in-office care in convenient locations with same day or next day appointments from a warm and caring staff. In addition to supporting members with routine and preventative primary, chronic and acute care, we provide lab and immunization services, COVID-19 testing and care, behavioral health, women's health, men's health, LGBTQ+ care, pediatrics, geriatrics, sports medicine, lifestyle, and well-being programs.
•Employers. We support more than 9,000 enterprise clients across a diverse set of industries in achieving key goals of their health benefits offerings such as attracting and engaging employees, improving employee productivity and well-being, and delivering higher levels of value-based care. We are also helping them increase the safety of their workplace through screening for, treating, and immunizing against communicable diseases such as COVID-19. With real-time video and phone consults available typically within minutes, and same and next day in-office appointments, we have demonstrated a 41% reduction in emergency room visits and total employer cost savings of 8% or more based on a 2018 report. Additionally, a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open in 2020 linked our membership-based, primary care model combining virtual, near-site, and work-site services with 45% lower total medical and prescription claims costs for one employer, including 54% lower spending on specialty care, 43% lower spending on surgery, 33% lower spending on emergency department care, and 26% lower spending on prescriptions. Since then, we have further evolved our service offering, including scheduled virtual visits or behavioral health visits, which we believe provides additional value to employers and their employees. We have also launched a 24/7 virtual only service offering which is available exclusively to employees of our employer customers in geographies where we do not yet have a physical presence. This service offering allows employers to provide One Medical to all of their employees regardless of their location, while providing us with better insights about employer demographics and potential future demand for our other offerings. Employers typically cover our membership fee for their employees, with over 85% of employers also covering their employees’ dependents’ memberships as of December 31, 2022. Employers can add our services at any point during the year, as our services typically fit within their existing health benefits offerings and are typically covered under an employer’s routine health insurance benefit program, allowing for seamless and quick implementation. Within enterprise clients, we estimate that our median activation rate as of December 31, 2022, was over 40%, which we believe we can increase over time. We define estimated activation rate for any enterprise client at a given time as the percentage of eligible lives enrolled as members. Some of our enterprise clients offer membership benefits to the dependents of their employees, for which we assume eligible lives include one dependent per employee.
•Providers. Our culture, technology, team-based approach, and salaried provider model help address the fundamental issues driving physician burnout. Our culture allows us to attract and retain top board-certified physicians and premier team members. We are focused on continuing to increase our diversity amongst providers so that our provider base reflects the diversity of the communities and members we serve. Our proprietary technology platforms allow for meaningful reductions in desktop medicine burdens, which are the excessive administrative hassles associated with the use of EHRs. Our support team takes on many of the administrative burdens for scheduling and insurance coordination. Our in-office and virtual medical teams jointly deliver 
longitudinal health care. Our salary-based provider compensation model incentivizes delivery of the right care at the right time, without the adverse financial incentives that fee-for-service or compensation systems can have on clinical decision-making.
•Health Networks. Health networks partner with us for consumer-driven care, direct-to-employer relationships, coordinated networks of attributable lives, and At-Risk arrangements where we are responsible for managing a range of healthcare services and associated costs for our members. Through our partnerships, we connect our primarily working-age, commercially insured membership base with health networks without the costs and risks these health networks typically face in the development of their own primary care networks. In our Medicare business, we partner with health care payers to enable members to access our service and enter into At-Risk arrangements where we are responsible for managing a range of healthcare services and associated costs of our members. We clinically and digitally integrate with our health network partners to advance more seamless member access to partner specialists and facilities when needed, while supporting reductions in duplicative testing and excessive delays often seen across uncoordinated healthcare settings. Such coordinated care can deliver better service levels and outcomes for consumers, while advancing employee productivity and value-based care to employers and our payer partners.
We believe our model is highly scalable. Our business is driven by growth in Consumer and Enterprise members, and At-Risk members (see also Part II, Item 7 to this Annual Report, "Management's Discussion and Analysis — Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures"). We have developed a modernized membership model based on direct consumer enrollment and third-party sponsorship. Our membership model includes seamless access to 24/7 digital health paired with inviting in-office care routinely covered by most health care payers. Consumer and Enterprise members join either individually as consumers by paying an annual membership fee or are sponsored by a third party. At-Risk members are members for whom we are responsible for managing a range of healthcare services and associated costs. Digital health services are delivered via our mobile app and website, through such modalities as video and voice encounters, chat and messaging. We are physically present in 27 markets as of December 31, 2022, comprised of Atlanta, Austin, Birmingham, Boston, Cape Cod, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Greensboro, Hanover, Houston, Huntsville, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Orange County, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Tucson, and Washington, D.C., and serve patients across all stages of life, from the working-age, commercially-insured population and associated dependents to the Medicare populations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we retained 9 out of every 10 of our consumer, enterprise (as measured by contract value), and At-Risk members. We grew our total membership by 207% from December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022.
We derive net revenue, consisting of Medicare revenue and commercial revenue, from multiple stakeholders, including (i) consumers, (ii) enterprise clients such as employers, schools, and universities, and (iii) health networks such as health systems and private and government payers. 
We generate Medicare revenue from (i) Capitated Revenue from At-Risk arrangements with Medicare Advantage payers and CMS, and (ii) fee-for-service and other revenue from fee-for-service visits for Other Patients not covered under At-Risk arrangements and from certain payers for clinical start-up, administration, or on-going coordination of care activities associated with providing care to At-Risk members and other Medicare patients.
We generate commercial revenue from (i) partnership revenue from our health system partners with whom we have clinically and digitally integrated, primarily on a per member per month (“PMPM”) basis, largely fixed price or fixed price per employee contracts with enterprise clients for medical services and COVID-19 on-site testing services for enterprise clients, schools, and universities where we typically bill such customers a fixed price per service performed, (ii) net fee-for-service revenue from reimbursements received from our members' or other patients' health insurance plans or those with billing rates based on our agreements with our health network partners for healthcare services delivered to Consumer and Enterprise members on a fee-for-service basis, and (iii) membership revenue through the annual membership fees charged to either consumer members or enterprise clients, as well as fees paid for our One Medical Now service offering.
Industry Challenges and Our Opportunity
The current state of the healthcare ecosystem leaves key stakeholders frustrated and with unmet needs, delivering suboptimal results for consumers, employers, providers, and health networks. We believe that these unmet needs represent a significant opportunity for us.
Consumers
According to a 2020 report, approximately 71% of consumers are dissatisfied with their healthcare experience. Similarly, a 2022 report reported that 60% of Americans have had an outright negative healthcare experience. Their frustrations include long lead times to schedule physician appointments and long waits once checked-in at provider offices. Appointments often occur in crowded medical offices and are typically short in duration, affording limited time to develop deeper provider-patient relationships. Opportunities to engage with providers before and after visits, as well as during nights and weekends, are often limited or non-existent, even though healthcare needs are not constrained to the operating hours of provider offices. Care delivered is also often uncoordinated with providers, leaving consumers to navigate their own way through a complex system.
Employers
To attract and retain staff, employers are making significant investments in health benefits; yet, as commercial insurance costs have reached record highs, employers and employees remain frustrated. Barriers to accessing timely care during the day and after business hours cause employees to miss work and lose productivity. As a result, many employees self-direct to higher cost settings such as emergency rooms. Additionally, uncoordinated care across primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health settings creates frustration and causes excessive spending. According to a 2022 report by Health Affairs, as of 2021, U.S. health care expenditures exceeded $3.8 trillion, with one-third estimated to be wasteful expenditures.
Providers
By predominantly compensating primary care providers on volume, the prevalent fee-for-service approach seen within the industry incentivizes short and transactional medical encounters, often with insufficient time to address underlying issues related to acute care, chronic disease, and behavioral health issues. Such fee-for-service compensation may also incentivize greater referrals to specialists for more time-intensive cases, even when such patients could otherwise be treated effectively within primary care. Management of preventive care and chronic conditions through longitudinal relationships is typically less-reimbursed, if paid for at all. In addition, providers often find themselves performing excessive administrative tasks that could be better performed by other staff or eliminated altogether. They suffer from rising administrative time spent populating data into cumbersome EHR systems, and documentation hassles associated with insurance procedures. These dynamics contribute to lower job satisfaction and provider burnout.
Health Networks
While many health networks have sought to better integrate primary care with specialty and hospital care, they may underperform on service, access, and coordination of care. This is partly due to their internal incentive systems, processes, and technologies, which are typically focused on addressing high revenue specialty care, rather than best supporting primary care. Moreover, primary care networks can be very costly to develop, and can require significant ongoing investments to operate, while often underperforming on strategic and financial objectives. According to the American Hospital Association's Futurescan survey of hospital CEOs and leaders published in 2019, 75% of hospital and health systems operate their primary care networks at a loss or are willing to do so, with 76% of health system leaders indicating they are pursuing or are likely to pursue external relationships to advance their physician networks and better serve consumers.
We have developed a human-centered, technology-powered primary care model that simultaneously addresses the aforementioned frustrations and unmet needs of key stakeholders. As we continue to deploy our model at scale, we disrupt the healthcare ecosystem from within its current structure through our:
•modernized healthcare membership model based on direct consumer enrollment and third-party sponsorship;
•seamless care delivery that integrates across multiple digital and in-person modalities;
•inviting offices with high quality service in convenient locations;
•partnerships with health networks, including alignment with payers;
•premier salaried medical group;
•advanced technology-powered systems; and
•service-oriented team implementing Lean processes.
Our Value Proposition
Our modernized human-centered and technology-powered primary care model simultaneously addresses the frustrations and unmet needs faced by key stakeholders.
Value Proposition for Consumers
•Greater engagement for better health and better care. We regularly and proactively engage our members digitally and in-person. Members can digitally access medical information, prescriptions, lab results and other health data, and can reach out to our team regarding medical issues or health questions around-the-clock. Members may receive digital health status check-ins before and after office encounters, and our technology facilitates further follow-up with our providers.
•Unique digital health experience. Our dedicated and compassionate providers and other team members deliver 24/7 digital care. Members engage through our website or mobile app in timely synchronous and asynchronous interactions, selecting their communication modality of choice, including messaging, text, voice and video. Our in-house virtual team delivers 24/7 service to address health concerns and administrative questions, coordinating with our in-office providers through a common EHR that is shared across digital and in-office settings.
•Superior in-office care experience. We are focused on providing kind and attentive in-person care in aesthetically pleasing offices with contemporary interior designs. We offer same- or next-day appointments with minimal wait upon arrival in locations convenient to where consumers work, shop and live. Members enter into first-name relationships with providers who greet them upon arrival and walk them out upon appointment completion. Our approach allows for more time to thoroughly address a broader array of issues and to develop deeper relationships than traditional primary care settings.
•Longitudinal approach to care. Our approach treats the whole person by including the physical, mental, social, emotional, and administrative needs of our members. In addition to supporting members with routine and preventative primary, chronic and acute care, we provide lab and immunization services, COVID-19 testing and care, behavioral health, women's health, men's health, LGBTQ+ care, pediatrics, geriatrics, sports medicine, lifestyle, and well-being programs. We proactively reach out to members to assess their health status and mental wellness and follow up with reminders on key health initiatives. These initiatives support the health of our members with the goal of avoiding more costly care in the future. 
•Greater care coordination. We can serve as a trusted advisor to our members and, through our administrative teams and technology, help them better navigate the healthcare ecosystem. Our health network partnerships further advance clinically and digitally integrated care across primary, specialty, and acute care settings by streamlining access to leading specialists and reducing delays and duplicative tests.
•Improved health outcomes. We help drive better health outcomes for our members, as reflected in our key primary care-related HEDIS quality metrics. To prevent avoidable conditions and advance health, we can conduct population health initiatives such as proactively screening for cancers, chronic diseases, anxiety, and depression.
•COVID-19. We offer COVID-19 testing and counseling across all of our markets, and also administer COVID-19 vaccines in select geographies.
Value Proposition for Employers
•Differentiated and highly valued employee benefit. We believe our model enhances the benefits offering of employers, improving their recruitment and retention of talent. 
•Increased workforce productivity. We reduce time away from work as well as employee distraction related to illness, injury or other medical conditions by providing quick and convenient access to care for employees and dependents, including virtual care. With longer appointments, we address more needs in our primary care setting, reducing avoidable referrals and additional time away from work. Additionally, our ability to facilitate timely specialist appointments with our health network partners further reduces an employee's distraction while waiting for specialty care.
•Reduced costs. We reduce health care costs by increasing employee productivity and providing value-based care, substituting higher cost emergency room and specialty services with lower-cost primary care. We help avoid unnecessary testing and higher cost branded prescriptions through best practice clinical protocols embedded in our technology. For example, we have demonstrated a 41% reduction in emergency room visits and total employer cost savings of 8% or more. A peer-reviewed study published in JAMA Network Open in 2020 linked our membership-based, primary care model combining virtual, near-site, and work-site services with 45% lower total medical and prescription claims costs for one employer.
•Insights on improving employee health and value-based care. We support population health improvement and medical cost assessment by analyzing anonymized aggregated health record information and employee health engagement patterns. We work with employers to better understand the health needs of their employees as well as to review overall utilization patterns. Our aggregated anonymized EHR information allows for timelier and deeper insights to help employers improve their health benefits programs and achieve higher levels of value.
Value Proposition for Providers
•More fulfilling way to practice. Our providers develop meaningful relationships with our members over time, allowing them to help improve healthy behaviors and better coordinate member health needs. Their relationships with members are more longitudinal and less transactional. Our providers are also supported by our technology platforms which enable them to practice at the top of their license while serving patients throughout all stages of life, making their work more professionally rewarding while reducing factors driving burnout.
•Team-based approach across care modalities. Our in-office providers and our virtual team collaborate for longitudinal health care across time and settings. Our virtual care team and administrative specialists reduce our in-office providers' workloads while promoting 24/7 care. Providers can better focus on caring for patients during clinical interactions, while excessive administrative tasks can be handled by other team members.
•Purpose-built technology platforms. Our proprietary technology platforms are developed with significant provider input and are purpose-built for primary care. For example, our technology is focused on capturing and surfacing the most meaningful clinical insights in a workflow that is intuitive to providers. Our platform meaningfully reduces administrative workloads by intelligently automating, streamlining, and routing tasks across our network to the most appropriate team member, resulting in faster response times while freeing up providers to focus on caring for members.
•Salaried model with flexible work schedules. Our salaried model avoids adverse fee-for-service and capitation incentives, and does not financially reward or penalize our providers based on utilization. It supports the delivery of the right amount of care in the best setting without impacting provider take-home pay. Additionally, we have flexible work arrangements and opportunities to practice in office or virtually. We believe this results in a better quality of life and work-life balance. With a growing presence in markets across the country, we also increasingly offer providers mobility opportunities.
Value Proposition for Health Networks
•Expansion of health networks. Our partnership model allows health networks to augment their existing primary care and network strategies, without significant additional investment in capital, technology or management resources. Partnering with us can be a more effective, expeditious, economical, and less risky way of developing a coordinated network of attributable lives. Additionally, our model can better position health networks with consumers and employers by focusing on consumer-driven care and facilitating direct-to-employer relationships.
•Attractive member base. Health networks look to partner with us to proactively establish relationships with our largely commercially-insured members.
•Coordinated care. We clinically and digitally integrate our modernized primary care model with our health network partners' provider networks, better coordinating care for members across a continuum of settings. We digitally integrate EHR information, avoiding duplicative testing often seen when patients are referred across care settings. Through better coordination, we provide members with more seamless access to specialty care when needed. We simultaneously reduce excessive health network administrative costs by linking our referral processes 
and digital technologies with health network partners. This coordination of care can lead to better experiences and outcomes for members, as well as reduced costs.
•Value-Based Care. Our primary care model focuses on providing the right care at the right time, thereby reducing the need for costly and potentially unnecessary medical care which is often prevalent in the current fee-for-service healthcare system. As a result, we enter into At-Risk arrangements with payers such as Medicare Advantage plans and CMS, where we are responsible for managing a range of healthcare services and associated costs of our members.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following are our key competitive strengths.
Modernized Membership-Based Model
Our membership-based model supports ongoing and longitudinal relationships where we can serve as trusted advisors to our members and as partners to our enterprise clients and health networks. Our model also generates stable revenue which is recurring in nature. By having an enrolled population of members, we can proactively reach out to members to encourage adherence to treatment protocols or to check in on their care needs. The relationship inherent in a membership model is very different than the traditional model of transactional patient care visits, where a provider typically only engages with a patient if the patient comes in for a visit. We proactively engage with our members on a regular basis through our digital platform and in our welcoming offices, and believe we are better able to develop long-term connections and relationships with them.
Extraordinary Customer Experience 
Our human-centered approach is focused on providing a superior experience to our members, as evidenced by the bundling of services within our membership model, the way we hire and train our team, the culture of caring we foster, our easy-to-use technology, our 24/7 digital health, our inviting in-office care, our compassionate and salaried providers, and our streamlined Lean processes, which allows us to more efficiently and effectively serve our members. Whether members call, click, or visit, they experience outstanding service, as evidenced by our average NPS of 90 across our membership base over the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. See "Overview" section above for a description of how we calculate NPS. Our virtual care is available around-the-clock. Our inviting medical offices are well-appointed and modern, and our providers and staff are very friendly and trained in customer service. We are committed to not keeping members waiting long, if at all, and our longer appointments provide our team with more time to address member needs. Our technology is designed to promote frictionless access, ease of use, and high engagement. We look to address the whole-person needs of our members, providing physical and mental health services, lab services, and coordinating specialty services with health network partners. Our administrative staff is available to answer benefits questions and help navigate the healthcare ecosystem on behalf of our members.
Simultaneously Addressing the Needs of Consumers, Employers, Providers and Health Networks
Our modernized model simultaneously addresses the frustrations and unmet needs of key stakeholders, transforming health care from within the current ecosystem. For consumers, we deliver an extraordinary experience and superior results, including on key primary care-related HEDIS quality measures. For employers, we help improve employee productivity through frictionless access to virtual and in-office care and reduce medical costs by avoiding unnecessary emergency room and specialty visits. For providers, we create a more engaging and manageable primary care work environment by leveraging a salaried model and our proprietary technology. With health networks, we clinically integrate to expand their connections to commercially insured enrollees, and we are in-network with most health insurance plans in all of our markets. Our ability to lower medical costs for our members also allows us to enter into value-based arrangements with select health networks such as Medicare Advantage health plans and CMS. Accordingly, we believe our model delivers differentiated value to all key stakeholders simultaneously within the current healthcare ecosystem.
Engaged, Salaried Providers Delivering Best-in-Class Care
We offer an outstanding environment to practice primary care, as reflected in our high provider retention rates and strong engagement scores. Our salaried compensation approach allows our providers to deliver patient-centered care without impacting their pay as might be the case under fee-for-service compensation approaches. Our providers also have significantly fewer EHR tasks to complete due to our proprietary technology that is purpose-built for primary care, freeing up their time to focus on delivering outstanding clinical care.
Proprietary Technology Platforms
Our ability to simultaneously deliver significant value to key stakeholders is deeply rooted in our purpose-built, modernized technology platforms. Our proprietary technology powers all aspects of our company: engaging members, supporting providers, and advancing business objectives. Our technology allows us to proactively engage members with personalized clinical outreach and improve health through online scheduling, virtual provider visits, and ready access to health information. Our technology also supports providers by leveraging machine learning to reduce and re-route tasks that needlessly create administrative burdens while supporting team-based care. This allows providers to spend more time delivering clinical care, while facilitating higher levels of member responsiveness. Our technology also advances operational efficiencies, as our product designers and engineers collaborate closely with clinical and operational team members to observe and optimize workflows in ways that support better tracking of our members' health and outcomes. Our platform is built on a modern cloud-based technology stack, employing Agile development cycles and a DevOps approach to infrastructure. Our modular, service-oriented architecture utilizes Application Programming Interface ("API") standards for ease of implementing new functionalities and integrating with external systems.
Operating Platform for High Performance at Scale
Our approach for operating and scaling our platform is based on leading process improvement and management practices. We leverage Lean methodologies for process improvement, human-centered design thinking, behavioral design, and Agile methodologies for software development to deliver high performance levels at scale. Our operational processes, software development and staffing models, including our virtual medical team, are designed to work together to create efficiencies and uniquely achieve our objectives. Moreover, we standardize our processes and practices so we can efficiently deliver consistent outcomes at scale across existing and new markets, which we believe will further drive our financial performance.
Highly Experienced Management Team
Our management team has extensive experience working with leading health systems, health plans, technology companies, service organizations, consumer brands, and enterprise-sales-driven companies. Our leadership embodies our cultural alignment around our behavioral tenants of being human-centered, team-based, unbounded in thinking, driven to excel, and intellectually curious. Our leaders help organize teams of clinicians, technologists, and staff to regularly engage together in designing processes and software to further advance our objectives. Accordingly, our Company is well positioned to execute on our objectives and advance an outstanding workplace environment.
Our Growth Strategies
To transform health care at scale, we can pursue growth through the following avenues.
Grow membership in existing markets
We have significant opportunities to increase members in our existing geographies through (i) new sales to consumers and enterprise clients, (ii) expansion of the number of enrolled members, including dependents, within our enterprise clients, (iii) expansion of the number of At-Risk members, including Medicare Advantage participants or Medicare members for which we are at risk as a result of CMS' Direct Contracting Program (now redesigned and renamed the ACO REACH Program), (iv) expansion of Medicare Advantage payers, with whom we contract, and (v) adding other potential services. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 9,000 enterprise clients. Of our 796,000 Consumer and Enterprise members as of December 31, 2022, 64% were from our enterprise clients. Within enterprise clients, our median activation rate as of December 31, 2022 was over 40%. We believe the number of clients, the number of eligible lives and enrolled members will increase over time as our brand awareness grows and our customer relationships mature. We define estimated activation rate for any enterprise client at a given time as the percentage of eligible lives enrolled as members. Some of our enterprise clients offer membership benefits to the dependents of their employees, for which we assume eligible lives include one dependent per employee. Additionally, while the percentage of enterprise clients offering our services to dependents of their employees has grown from 67% in 2016 to over 85% as of December 31, 2022, we believe we have continued room to further grow the number of enterprise clients offering membership benefits to dependent of their employees. Furthermore, as we continue to scale our presence, we anticipate an increasing number of larger national and regional employers will look to partner with us for our services. 
As of December 31, 2022, we also had approximately 40,000 At-Risk members and partnered with 10 Medicare Advantage payers across our 10 geographies where we have At-Risk members. 
Expand into new markets
We are physically present in 27 markets with plans to enter two new markets in 2023. We assess potential markets using a variety of metrics, including population demographics and density, employer presence, potential health network partners, and other factors. In addition, we offer One Medical Now, a service offering that provides 24/7 access to unlimited virtual care nationwide, which is sold to new and existing enterprise clients to cover employees in geographies where we are not yet physically present. We do not count employees who have access to or use One Medical Now as members, but we believe this new virtual offering may help us enroll new members in a new geography if and when we decide to offer our in-person offering. We believe some or all of our service offerings are viable in most geographies across the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, our At-Risk offering was available in 10 markets, and our commercial offering was available in 21 markets. We expect to continue to expand our At-Risk offering into markets where we currently only have a commercial offering, as well as our commercial offering into markets where we currently only have an At-Risk offering. In addition, we plan to enter new U.S. markets to continue to grow our business. Given our service offering, we can expand our Medicare Advantage offering throughout the year and are not beholden to the annual Medicare enrollment cycle. 
Grow health network partnerships
To accelerate our growth and presence, we can extend existing health network partnerships into new markets where our partners may also have a presence, or we can enter into new health network partnerships in new or existing markets. In 2022, we entered into two markets with new health network partners, and added additional Medicare Advantage payers to our health network partnerships.
Expand services and populations
We currently provide services to members across all stages of life. In addition to supporting members with routine and preventative primary, chronic and acute care, we typically provide lab and immunization services, women's health, men's health, LGBTQ+ care, pediatrics, geriatrics, sports medicine, lifestyle, and well-being programs. In addition, we expanded our service offering in part as a response to COVID-19 and launched several new billable services, including:
•COVID-19 testing and counseling across all of our markets;
•COVID-19 vaccines in select geographies;
•Mindset by One Medical, our behavioral health service integrated within primary care;
•One Medical Now, an expansion of our 24/7 on-demand digital health solutions to employees of enterprise clients located in geographies where we are not yet physically present; and,
•Remote Visits, where our providers perform typical primary care visits with our members remotely.
Competition
We compete in a highly fragmented primary care market with direct and indirect competitors that offer varying services to key stakeholders such as consumers, employers, providers, and health networks. Our competitive success is contingent on our ability to simultaneously address the needs of key stakeholders efficiently and with superior outcomes at scale. We expect to face increasing competition, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages to compete for some or all key stakeholders in our markets, as well as new entrants into our market.
We believe our most direct competition today is from primary care providers who are employed by or affiliated with health networks. We also face competition from direct-to-consumer solutions or employer-focused on-site primary care offerings. These competitors may be narrower in their competitive footprint and may not address all the key stakeholders we serve simultaneously. Our indirect competitors also include episodic point solutions such as telemedicine offerings as well as urgent care providers. These offerings may typically pay providers on a fee-for-service basis rather than the salaried model we employ. Given the size of the healthcare industry and the extent of unmet needs, we expect additional competition, potentially from new companies, including smaller emerging companies which could introduce new solutions and services, as well as other incumbent players in the healthcare industry or from other industries who could develop, or acquire, their own offerings and may have substantial resources and relationships to leverage. In particular, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing or new competitors have developed or further invested in telemedicine and remote medicine programs and ventures, which would compete with our virtual care offerings. With the emergence of new technologies and market entrants, we expect to face 
increasing competition over time, which we believe will generally increase awareness of the need for modernized primary care models and other innovative solutions in the United States and globally.
The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
•patient engagement, satisfaction, and utilization;
•convenience, accessibility, and availability;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•technology capabilities including interoperability with legacy enterprise and health network infrastructures;
•ability to address the needs of employers and payers;
•ability to attract and retain quality providers;
•ability to reduce costs;
•level of participation in insurance plans;
•alignment with health networks;
•domain expertise in health care, technology, sales, and service;
•scalability of models; and
•operational execution abilities.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors and we believe the offerings of competitors inadequately address the needs of key stakeholders simultaneously or fail to do so at scale.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing initiatives focus on member growth through three primary avenues: directly acquiring consumer and Medicare members, working with Medicare agents and brokers, and signing agreements with employers that sponsor employee memberships as part of their benefits packages. We use sales and marketing strategies to reach consumers, Medicare eligibles, as well as enterprise benefits leaders. Enterprise marketing and sales strategies also include account-based marketing, business development initiatives, and client service teams focused on customer acquisition, employee enrollment, and member engagement. With a growing national model, we aspire to be the most loved brand in health care. We anchor our brand messaging on how we delight our members with human-centered, technology-powered care.
Consumer Sales & Marketing
When we market and sell directly to individuals who are not Medicare eligible, we initially focus on increasing brand awareness, followed by performance marketing targeted toward member enrollment.
Our marketing strategy in new markets is primarily centered on increasing overall brand awareness, familiarity, consideration, and ultimately enrollment. To achieve these objectives, we showcase our model via direct mail, print, digital, out-of-home, broadcast, and social media advertising. We also develop thought leadership content such as whitepapers, eBooks, and blog posts, and use public relations to secure earned media placements. Additionally, we participate in industry conferences, and may partner with media outlets, event venues, and local businesses to increase brand awareness.
As brand awareness increases in more established markets, we shift our efforts to performance marketing focused on both customer acquisition and engagement. Our performance marketing initiatives include customized task-based in-app messages and email communications to drive engagement among members, in addition to more targeted advertisements through direct mail, Google Search, YouTube, and social media for member acquisition.
Enterprise Sales & Marketing
Our in-house enterprise sales force is organized by geography and customer size. To support our sales force, we segment market data to help with prospect qualification and leverage publicly available and trade organization material to focus on enterprise clients who we believe value health outcomes and medical cost reduction targets. The sales analytics team further supports our value to employers with population health data and medical cost assessment. Additionally, our client services team actively manages our customer accounts through in-depth reporting on metrics such as NPS, member activation, utilization, engagement, and value.
We also work with channel partners such as health plans, payroll, and professional employer organizations to reach enterprise clients, including small and midsize businesses and early stage new businesses. Additionally, we partner with select regional and national benefits brokers and consultants to educate potential customers on our offerings.
After onboarding new enterprise accounts, we shift our focus to enrolling and engaging employees. These efforts include on-site visits to employers, enterprise email communications, and social media and other forms of performance marketing.
Medicare Sales & Marketing
Our growth strategy to the Medicare population is focused on balancing brand awareness and lead generation through paid media, organic activities, community/broker outreach, and an increasing focus on new channel growth primarily with telesales vendors. We create brand awareness through TV, radio, print, and out of home advertising, which is focused on telling our story and highlighting relationship-based care. We also add a variety of digital media and direct mail to drive lead generation and patient acquisition. We build fully integrated campaigns that vary by market based on market penetration, objectives, and market response rates to different initiatives. 
In addition to paid media, we focus on organic media through Search Engine Optimization ("SEO") work, online reviews, and driving word of mouth through our patient base.
We also deploy a field sales team who manages community outreach and local presence. This team works with agents and brokers to educate them on our care model. They also look for opportunities to connect with prospects directly in the communities we serve. Lastly, we have utilized third party telesales vendors to help drive new sales. 
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, and patent applications to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, we exclusively own 15 registered trademarks in the United States, including One Medical, Iora and other marks, with additional registrations currently pending. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use or may use in our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had no issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States. Currently, we do not have patent protection for any of our proprietary technology, including our technology platforms, mobile app or web portal. As of December 31, 2022, we have registered copyright ownership of the Healthy Together Playbook, an important part of our Healthy Together return-to-work program helping employers to safely bring their workforce back together amidst the pandemic as well as patient and provider materials.
We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information, including our algorithms, source and object code, designs, and business processes, through security measures and contractual restrictions. We seek to limit access to our confidential and proprietary information on a "need to know" basis and enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, vendors, and others that may receive or otherwise have access to any confidential or proprietary information. We have company policies relating to intellectual property protection and we train our workforce on the same from time to time. We also obtain written invention assignment agreements from our employees, consultants, and vendors that assign to us all right, interest, and title to inventions and work product developed during their employment or service engagement with us. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property to external parties through licensing or restricted use agreements. We have established a system of security measures to help protect our computer systems from security breaches and computer viruses. We have employed various technology and process-based methods, such as clustered and multi-layer firewalls, intrusion detection systems, vulnerability assessments, threat intelligence, content filtering, endpoint security (including anti-malware and detection response capabilities), email security mechanisms, and access control mechanisms. We also use encryption techniques for data at rest and in transit.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are high. Our profitability depends in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated professional entities and their providers, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all applicable licenses. A review of our operations by courts or regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the healthcare regulatory environment could change in a way that restricts our operations.
Practice of Medicine
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
We contract with our affiliated professional entities, who in turn employ or retain physicians and other medical providers to deliver professional clinical services to patients. We typically enter into ASAs with our affiliated professional entities pursuant to which we provide them with a wide range of administrative services and receive payment from the affiliated professional entity. These administrative services arrangements are subject to state laws, including those in certain of the states where we operate, which prohibit the practice of medicine by, and/or the splitting of professional fees with, non-professional persons or entities such as general business corporations.
Corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions vary widely from state to state. In addition, such prohibitions are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Our failure to comply could lead to adverse action against us and/or our providers by courts or state agencies, civil or criminal penalties, loss of provider licenses, or the need to restructure our business model and/or physician relationships, any of which could harm our business.
Practice of Medicine and Provider Licensing
The practice of medicine by our affiliated professional entities is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and requirements, including, among other things, laws relating to the practice of medicine (including remote care), quality and adequacy of care, non-physician personnel (including advanced practitioners and non-clinicians), supervisory requirements, behavioral health, medical equipment, and the prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification, and Related Laws and Guidelines
Providers who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located, unless there are applicable exceptions. Federal and state laws also limit the ability of providers to prescribe pharmaceuticals and controlled substances via telehealth. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to adverse action against our providers, which could harm our business model and/or physician relationships and have a negative impact on our business.
Other Healthcare Laws
The False Claims Act and its implementing regulations include several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to non-governmental payers. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which includes private payers. Violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme, or device, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. The federal government engages in significant civil and criminal enforcement efforts against healthcare companies under the False Claims Act and other civil and criminal statutes. False Claims Act investigations can be initiated not only by the government, but by private parties through qui tam (or whistleblower) lawsuits. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $12,537 to $25,076 per false claim or statement (as of May 2022, and subject to annual adjustments for inflation), plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. Violations of the False Claims Act violations can also result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted analogous or similar fraud and false claims laws.
In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, (1) inappropriate billing of services to government healthcare programs, (2) employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, and (3) offering or providing Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries with any remuneration, including full or partial waivers of co-payments and deductibles, that are likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier (subject to an exception for non-routine, unadvertised co-payment and deductible waivers based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts).
State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws 
We must comply with various federal and state laws related to the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the "HITECH Act"), and its implementing regulations, establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and requires the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. The affiliated professional entities are regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. HIPAA's requirements are also directly applicable to the contractors, agents, and other business associates of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with their provision of services to covered entities. 1Life and its subsidiaries are business associates of the affiliated professional entities, health network partners, and other covered entities when performing certain administrative services on their behalf.
We are also subject to the HIPAA breach notification rule, which requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI. In addition, covered entities must notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, and the local media if a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to OCR on an annual basis. The HIPAA regulations also require business associates to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
Violations of HIPAA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. Many states in which we operate have their own laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. We must comply with such laws in the states where we do business in addition to our obligations under HIPAA. In some states, such as California, state privacy laws are even more protective than HIPAA. It may sometimes be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. State data privacy and security laws are subject to change, and we could be subject to financial penalties and sanctions if we fail to comply with these laws.
In addition to federal and state laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information, we may be subject to other types of federal and state privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, along with laws that impose specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
Federal Stark Law
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain "designated health services" if the referring physician or a member of the physician's immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of various fraud, waste, and abuse laws, including the Stark Law, can be considered a predicate legal violation to submission of a false claim under the federal False Claims Act (described below) on the grounds that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws and rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. Penalties for violating the Stark Law may include: denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the law, recoupments of monies paid for such services, civil penalties for each violation and three times the dollar value of each such service, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Violations of the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which, subject to certain exceptions known as "safe harbors," prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce, the (1) the referral of a person covered by government healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under government healthcare programs, or (3) the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, of any item or service reimbursable under government healthcare programs. Federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if just one purpose of a payment is to induce referrals. Actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it is not required, which makes it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the state of mind required for a violation. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has promulgated safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all elements of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by OIG and other enforcement authorities. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from government healthcare programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
State Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud, waste, and abuse laws to those described above. The scope and content of these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities. Some states' fraud and abuse laws, known as "all-payer laws," are not limited to government healthcare programs, but apply more broadly to items or services reimbursed by any payer, including commercial insurers. Liability under state fraud, waste, and abuse laws could result in fines, penalties, and restrictions on our ability to operate in those jurisdictions.
Our Health Network Partnerships
Our health network partnerships include health system partners and arrangements with private and government payers.
Health System Partners
We have entered into strategic partnership arrangements with each of our health system partners under which we and the health system partner create a clinically integrated care delivery model that coordinates our network of affiliated primary care practices with the health system partner's healthcare system to better deliver coordinated care for members, improve operational efficiencies, and deliver value to employers and other players.
Fee Structure
Under most of the strategic partnership arrangements, the health system partners contract with one or more of our affiliated professional entities for professional clinical services and contract with 1Life for management, operational and administrative services, including billing and collection services and designing and managing the day-to-day administration of the business aspects of the primary care practices. Under these arrangements, when our medical offices provide professional clinical services to covered members, we, as administrator, perform billing and collection services on behalf of the health system, and the health system receives the fees for the services provided, including those paid by members' insurance plans. In return for these professional clinical, management, operational and administrative services, we receive (i) fees from these health system partners primarily on a PMPM basis, which may be based on various factors such as visit rates, other primary care relationships our health system partners may have and the rates these health system partners receive from payers or (ii) fee-for-service payments based on our health system partners' health insurance contracts.
Term and Termination
The term of each strategic partnership arrangement is typically five or more years and automatically renews for additional two- to five-year terms unless either we or the health system partners decide not to renew. We or the health system partners generally may terminate a strategic partnership arrangement with 90 days' notice upon certain events such as uncured breach, mutual consent or a change in law that conflicts with the applicable arrangement. The strategic partnership arrangements generally may be terminated immediately upon certain events such as bankruptcy, exclusion, and, in some cases, business combinations involving us and a specified competing health system. Certain health system partners may also terminate 
upon their determination that we no longer meet their criteria for clinical partnership or the values or mission of the health system partner.
Exclusivity and Non-Solicitation
Under the terms of strategic partnership arrangements, we typically cannot enter into a similar arrangement with direct competitors to the health system partner within the territory covered by the strategic partnership arrangement. Additionally, the terms of some of the strategic partnership arrangements include a mutual non-solicitation clause, prohibiting us and our health system partners from soliciting each other's employees during the term of the arrangement and for one year following its expiration, subject to certain customary recruiting practices.
Clinic Commitments and Development Fees
Pursuant to each strategic partnership arrangement, we typically commit to open an initial number of clinics, ranging from low single digits to mid-teen double digits depending on the area covered, within the initial term. Our health system partners pay us certain development fees for the opening of each clinic.
Arrangements with Private and Government Payers
We have entered into At-Risk arrangements with a variety of Medicare payers such as private Medicare health plans including large national and regional payers, as well as with CMS, in which we receive a PMPM fee and are responsible for managing a range of healthcare services and associated costs of our members. Our At-Risk arrangements with private payers are generally managed on a region by region basis and we typically enter into a separate contract in each region with a payer's local affiliate.
The PMPM fee that we receive is determined in part by these payers and is based on a variety of patient factors such as age and demographic benchmarks, and further adjusted to reflect the underlying complexity of a patient’s health conditions (acuity). Under certain contracts, we may also adjust the PMPM fees for a percentage share of any additional gross capitated revenues and associated medical claims expense generated by the provision of healthcare services not directly provided by us. 
Private Payer Arrangements
Our At-Risk arrangements with private payers generally range from two to 11 years and will typically renew automatically for additional one- to two-year terms unless either we or the private payer decide not to renew. In general, at the end of an initial term, we or the private payer may terminate an arrangement with not less than 120 days’ notice. Also, we or the private payer generally may terminate an arrangement immediately upon certain events such as bankruptcy and exclusion or with 60 days' notice upon certain events such as uncured breach, mutual consent, or a change in law that conflicts with the applicable arrangement. 
ACO REACH Program (formerly CMS' Direct Contracting Program) with CMS
We have entered into an agreement with CMS to participate in the ACO REACH Program. The ACO REACH Program is a new payment model in which CMS contracts directly with a limited number of organizations as Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, and is part of CMS’ strategy to improve quality of care and care coordination for traditional Medicare beneficiaries through value-based care models. We are one of this limited group of companies chosen by CMS to be an ACO and participate in the Global Risk component of the Program, which started on April 1, 2021 and will be tested over six years. The ACO REACH Program allows traditional Medicare beneficiaries to align to us in an At-Risk model in which we receive a capitated, per member per month payment for managing the health of the enrolled member that is based on a CMS benchmark.
Our Enterprise Client Agreements
We enter into contractual arrangements with our enterprise clients pursuant to which our clients purchase memberships from us for their employees and, in certain circumstances, we provide on-site and near-site clinics and health services. The transaction price for memberships under most of these contracts is determined on a per employee per month basis, based on the number of employees eligible for membership established at the beginning of each contract period. Our contracts with enterprise clients typically have one- to three-year terms.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Well-Being and Culture
We recognize that to be successful in our mission to transform healthcare, we need to take care of our teams as much as we take care of the members we serve. We reinforce this through our culture and team-based approach to longitudinal care as well as our salaried provider model, which eliminates the volume-based, fee-for-service compensation model commonly seen in our industry that could drive provider burnout. We also offer flexible work arrangements and opportunities to practice in-office or virtually. We believe this results in a better quality of life and work-life balance. 
To assist us with tracking the levels of engagement and satisfaction of our team members, we conduct annual team member engagement surveys to assess their views on the Company’s employee well-being, work-life blend, career advancement opportunities, inclusion and learning and development opportunities. We also provide our team members with confidential channels to voice their concerns. The feedback that we collect from these surveys and from alternative channels are used to assess employee engagement, our Company culture and our workplace environment as well as to refine and implement programs and processes for our team members. Our commitment to a team-based, collaborative environment and the values and benefits we provide to employees contributed to us being named by Forbes and Statista as one of America's Best Midsize Employers of 2022.
We believe our culture embodies five distinct qualities which we refer to as our DNA:

Human-Centered. We stay humble and empathetic, putting people at the heart of everything we build and every decision we make.

Team-Based. We communicate effectively, respect our teammates, and make the difficult tradeoffs that foster the success of the organization.

Intellectually Curious. We know we don't know everything; we're always eager to learn, and we're never afraid to question the status quo.

Unbounded-Thinking. By staying open minded, creative and positive, we aim to push beyond constraints that have stymied those before us.

Driven to Excel. In our quest to be the best Primary Care group in the country, we focus on getting things done and pay attention to the little details that matter.
Training and Development
 We believe in ensuring that all team members have access to tools to help them grow their careers and have focused our training and development on two primary areas: professional/career and leader development. We have invested in an array of internally generated and externally sourced learning resources, including a range of in-person, virtual and self-directed learning opportunities for our team members to help them develop the skills and competencies to further their career at One Medical.
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to fair and equitable compensation practices and, as a primary care company, we take a comprehensive approach to curating benefits for our employees to enable them to thrive personally and professionally. We also offer benefits that support an employee's mental, physical, financial and family well-being. Qualifying employees have access to a variety of benefits, including, medical, dental and vision coverage, childcare benefits, flexible spending accounts, financial wellness and planning, paid time-off and parental leave, life and disability insurance, 401(k) plan matching contributions and resources for health and wellness, including complimentary One Medical membership and access to One Medical Virtual Coaching and various employee assistance programs. We also offer a four-week Company-paid sabbatical to qualifying team members who reach five and 10 years of service with us to allow team members to pursue personal and professional development. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also implemented special paid-time-off policies for employees who need to quarantine due to exposure to COVID-19.
Diversity and Inclusion
We also recognize the importance of having a diverse and inclusive environment as part of our mission of transforming healthcare. We maintain a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice Committee to encourage best practices to foster diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice in the workplace. To help support career development for our Black, Indigenous and People of Color, or BIPOC, team members, we have implemented mentorship programs and have also implemented training programs to help advance our culture of diversity, inclusion, equity, and justice. We have established a Health Equity Domain Working Group that provides expertise on clinical best practices and education in a manner that respects the diversity of our patients and acknowledges the social determinants of health that impact their health.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,698 full-time employees and none of our employees were represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
