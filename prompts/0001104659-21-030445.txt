Business Overview
 
We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our core objective is to leverage our proprietary phospholipid drug conjugate™ (PDC™) delivery platform to develop PDCs that are designed to specifically target cancer cells and deliver improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects. Our PDC platform possesses the potential for the discovery and development of the next generation of cancer-targeting treatments, and we plan to develop PDCs both independently and through research and development collaborations.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainties in the expected timelines for clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies such as us, and because of such uncertainties, it is difficult for us to accurately predict expected outcomes. We have not yet experienced any significant impacts as a result of the pandemic. However, COVID-19 may impact our future ability to recruit patients for clinical studies, obtain adequate supply of CLR 131 and obtain additional financing.
 
Our lead PDC therapeutic, CLR 131 is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to cancer cells, while limiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates CLR 131 from many traditional on-market treatments. CLR 131 is currently being evaluated in the CLOVER-WaM Phase 2 pivotal study in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), a Phase 2B study in r/r multiple myeloma (MM) patients and the CLOVER-2 Phase 1 study for a variety of pediatric cancers.
 
The CLOVER-1 Phase 2 study met the primary efficacy endpoints from the Part A dose-finding portion, conducted in r/r B-cell malignancies. The CLOVER-WaM Study is a pivotal registration study currently evaluating CLR 131 in Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) failed or suboptimal response in WM. The CLOVER-1 Phase 2B study is ongoing where CLR 131 remains under further evaluation in highly refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients.
 
The CLOVER-2 Phase 1 pediatric study is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancers, including malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, sarcomas, and lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma). The study is being conducted internationally at seven leading pediatric cancer centers.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted CLR 131 Fast Track Designation for WM patients having received two or more prior treatment regimens, as well as r/r MM and r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Orphan Drug Designations (ODDs) have been granted for WM, MM, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. CLR 131 was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. The European Commission granted an ODDs for r/r MM and WM.
 
Our product pipeline also includes one preclinical PDC chemotherapeutic program (CLR 1900) and several partnered PDC assets. The CLR 1900 Series is being targeted for solid tumors with a payload that inhibits mitosis (cell division) a validated pathway for treating cancers.
 
We have leveraged our PDC platform to establish three ongoing collaborations featuring four unique payloads and mechanisms of action. Through research and development collaborations, our strategy is to generate near-term capital, supplement internal resources, gain access to novel molecules or payloads, accelerate product candidate development and broaden our proprietary and partnered product pipelines.

Our PDC platform provides selective delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads to cancerous cells, whether a hematologic cancer or solid tumor, a primary tumor, or a metastatic tumor and cancer stem cells. The PDC platform’s mechanism of entry does not rely upon specific cell surface epitopes or antigens as are required by other targeted delivery platforms. Our PDC platform takes advantage of a metabolic pathway utilized by all tumor cell types in all stages of the tumor cycle. Tumor cells modify specific regions on the cell surface as a result of the utilization of this metabolic pathway. Our PDCs bind to these regions and directly enter the intracellular compartment. This mechanism allows the PDC molecules to accumulate in tumor cells over time, which can enhance drug efficacy, and to avoid the specialized highly acidic cellular compartment known as lysosomes, which allows a PDC to deliver molecules that previously could not be delivered. Additionally, molecules targeting specific cell surface epitopes face challenges in completely eliminating a tumor because the targeted antigens are limited in the total number on the cell surface, have longer cycling time from internalization to being present on the cell surface again and available for binding and are not present on all of the tumor cells in any cancer. This means a subpopulation of tumor cells always exist that cannot be targeted by therapies targeting specific surface epitopes. In addition to the benefits provided by the mechanism of entry, PDCs offer the ability to conjugate payload molecules in numerous ways, thereby increasing the types of molecules selectively delivered via the PDC.
 
The PDC platform features include the capacity to link with almost any molecule, provide a significant increase in targeted oncologic payload delivery and the ability to target all types of tumor cells. As a result, we believe that we can generate PDCs to treat a broad range of cancers with the potential to improve the therapeutic index of oncologic drug payloads, enhance or maintain efficacy while also reducing adverse events by minimizing drug delivery to healthy cells, and increasing delivery to cancerous cells and cancer stem cells.
 
We employ a drug discovery and development approach that allows us to efficiently design, research and advance drug candidates. Our iterative process allows us to rapidly and systematically produce multiple generations of incrementally improved targeted drug candidates.
 
In June 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted us Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) status by the EMA’s Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprise office. SME status allows us to participate in significant financial incentives that include a 90% to 100% EMA fee reduction for scientific advice, clinical study protocol design, endpoints and statistical considerations, quality inspections of facilities and fee waivers for selective EMA pre and post-authorization regulatory filings, including orphan drug and PRIME designations. We are also eligible to obtain EMA certification of quality and manufacturing data prior to review of clinical data. Other financial incentives include EMA-provided translational services of all regulatory documents required for market authorization, further reducing the financial burden of the market authorization process.
 
A description of our PDC product candidates follows:
 
Clinical Pipeline
 
Our lead PDC therapeutic, CLR 131 is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to cancer cells, while limiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates CLR 131 from many traditional on-market treatments and treatments in development. CLR 131 is currently being evaluated in the CLOVER-WaM Phase 2 pivotal study in patients with r/r WM, a Phase 2B study in r/rMM patients and the CLOVER-2 Phase 1 study for a variety of pediatric cancers. 
 
CLR 131 is currently being evaluated in a pivotal study, CLOVER-WaM, in WM patients that have failed or had a suboptimal response to a BTKi therapy after receiving first line standard of care. The CLOVER-1 Phase 2 study met the primary efficacy endpoints from the Part A dose-finding portion, conducted in r/r B-cell malignancies, and is now enrolling an MM expansion cohort (Phase 2B). The Phase 2B study will evaluate highly refractory MM patients including triple, quad and penta class refractory patients. The initial Investigational New Drug (IND) application was accepted by the FDA in March 2014 with multiple INDs submitted since that time. The Phase 1 study was designed to assess the compound’s safety and tolerability in patients with r/r MM (to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and was initiated in April 2015. The study completed enrollment and the final clinical study report is expected in the first half of 2021. Initiated in March 2017, the primary goal of the Phase 2A study was to assess the compound’s efficacy in a broad range of hematologic cancers.

The CLOVER-2 Phase 1 pediatric study is being conducted internationally at seven leading pediatric cancer centers. The study is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancers, including malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, sarcomas, and lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma). The FDA previously accepted our IND application for a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalating study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous administration of CLR 131 in up to 30 children and adolescents with cancers including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and malignant brain tumors. This study was initiated during the first quarter of 2019. These cancer types were selected for clinical, regulatory and commercial rationales, including the radiosensitive nature and continued unmet medical need in the r/r setting, and the rare disease determinations made by the FDA based upon the current definition within the Orphan Drug Act.
 
In December 2014, the FDA granted ODD for CLR 131 for the treatment of MM. In 2018, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. In May 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of MM and in July 2019 for the treatment of DLBCL, in September 2019 CLR 131 received Orphan Drug Designation from the European Union for Multiple Myeloma, in January 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for CLR 131 Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia and the European Union granted Orphan Drug Designation for CLR 131 Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. The FDA granted Fast Track designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of WM in May 2020.
 
The FDA may award priority review vouchers (PRV) to sponsors of a RPDD that meet its specified criteria. The key criteria to receiving a PRV is that the disease being treated is life-threatening and that it primarily effects individuals under the age of 18. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease can receive a PRV that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Additionally, the PRV’s can be exchanged or sold to other companies so that the receiving company may use the voucher.
 
CLOVER-WaM: Phase 2 Study Pivotal Study in: Patients with r/r Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia
 
In January 2021, we announced that a Type C guidance meeting with the FDA was conducted in September of 2020. The results of that guidance meeting provided Cellectar with an agreed upon path for conducting the CLOVER-WaM study; a single arm, pivotal study in WM patients that have received standard of care first line therapy and either failed or had a suboptimal response to BTKi therapy. The FDA agreed with the dose to be tested, our proposal for a safety and futility assessment to be conducted on the first 10 patients, the endpoint to be assessed, the statistical analysis plan and study size of 50 patients. Based upon this agreement the pivotal study was initiated. WM is a rare, indolent and incurable form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) that is composed of a patient population in need of new and better treatment options.
Phase 2A Study: Patients with r/r Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Cohort
 
Current data from our Phase 2A CLOVER-1 clinical study show that six WM patients demonstrated 100% overall response rate (ORR) and an 83.3% major response rate with one patient achieving a complete response (CR), which continues at nearly 27 months post- last treatment. While median treatment free survival (TRS) also known as treatment free remission (TFR)) and duration of response (DOR) has not been reached, the average treatment TFS/TFR is currently at 330 days. This may represent an important improvement in the treatment of r/r WM as we believe no approved or late-stage development treatments for second- and third-line patients have reported a CR to date.
Phase 2A Study: Patients with r/r Multiple Myeloma Cohort
 
In September 2020, we announced that a 40% ORR was observed in the subset of refractory multiple myeloma patients deemed triple class refractory who received 60 mCi or greater total body dose (TBD). Triple class refractory is defined as patients that are refractory to immunomodulatory, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 antibody drug classes. The 40% ORR (6/15 patients) represents triple class refractory patients enrolled in Part A of Cellectar’s CLOVER-1 study and additional patients enrolled in Part B from March through May 2020 and received >60mCi TBD. All MM patients enrolled in the expansion cohort are required to be triple class refractory. The additional six patients enrolled in 2020 were heavily pre-treated with an average of nine prior multi-drug regimens. Three patients received a TBD of > 60 mCi and three received less than 60 mCi. Consistent with the data released in February 2020, patients receiving > 60 mCi typically exhibit greater responses. Based on study results to date, patients continue to tolerate CLR 131 well, with the most common and almost exclusive treatment emergent adverse events being cytopenias.

Phase 2A: Patients with r/r non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma Cohort
 
In February 2020, we announced positive data from our Phase 2a CLOVER-1 study in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients were treated with three different doses (<50mCi, ~50mCi and >60mCi TBD. Patients with r/r NHL who received <60mCi TBD and the >60mCi TBD had a 42% and 43% ORR, respectively and a combined rate of 42%. These patients were also heavily pre-treated, having a median of three prior lines of treatment (range, 1 to 9) with the majority of patients being refractory to rituximab and/or ibrutinib. The patients had a median age of 70 with a range of 51 to 86. All patients had bone marrow involvement with an average of 23%. In addition to these findings, subtype assessments were completed in the r/r B-cell NHL patients. Patients with DLBCL demonstrated a 30% ORR with one patient achieving a (CR), which continues at nearly 24 months post-treatment. The ORR for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) patients was 33%.
 
Based upon the dose response observed in the Phase 2A for patients receiving TBDs of 60mCi or greater, we determined that patient dosing of CLR 131 would be >60mCi TBD. Therefore, patients are now grouped as receiving <60mCi or >60mCi TBD.
 
The most frequently reported adverse events in all patients were cytopenias, which followed a predictable course and timeline. The frequency of adverse events have not increased as doses were increased and the profile of cytopenias remains consistent. Importantly, these cytopenias have had a predictable pattern to initiation, nadir and recovery and are treatable. The most common grade ≥3 events at the highest dose (75mCi TBD) were hematologic toxicities including thrombocytopenia (65%), neutropenia (41%), leukopenia (30%), anemia (24%) and lymphopenia (35%). No patients experienced cardiotoxicities, neurological toxicities, infusion site reactions, peripheral neuropathy, allergic reactions, cytokine release syndrome, keratopathy, renal toxicities, or changes in liver enzymes. The safety and tolerability profile in patients with r/r NHL was similar to r/r MM patients except for fewer cytopenias of any grade. Based upon CLR 131 being well tolerated across all dose groups and the observed response rate, especially in difficult to treat patients such as high risk and triple class refractory or penta-refractory, and corroborating data showing the potential to further improve upon current ORRs and durability of those responses, the study has been expanded to test a two-cycle dosing optimization regimen with a target TBD >60 mCi/m2 of CLR 131.


In July 2016, we were awarded a $2,000,000 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research grant to further advance the clinical development of CLR 131. The funds supported the Phase 2 study initiated in March 2017 to define the clinical benefits of CLR 131 in r/r MM and other niche hematologic malignancies with unmet clinical need. These niche hematologic malignancies include Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/WM and DLBCL. The study is being conducted in approximately 10 U.S. cancer centers in patients with orphan-designated relapse or refractory hematologic cancers. The study’s primary endpoint is clinical benefit response (CBR), with secondary endpoints of ORR, progression free survival (PFS,) median Overall Survival (mOS) and other markers of efficacy following patients receiving one of three TBDs of CLR 131 (<50mCi, ~50mCi and >60mCi), with the option for a second cycle approximately 75-180 days later. Dosages were provided either as a single bolus or fractionated (the assigned dose level split into two doses) given day 1 and day 15.
 
In May 2020, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for CLR 131 in WM in patients having received two prior treatment regimens or more.
 
Phase 1 Study in Patients with r/r Multiple Myeloma
 
In February 2020, we announced the successful completion of our Phase 1 dose escalation study. Data from the study demonstrated that CLR 131 was safe and tolerated up to a TBD of approximately 95mCi in r/r MM. The Phase 1 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CLR 131 administered in an up to 30-minute I.V. infusion, either as a single bolus dose or as fractionated doses. The r/r multiple myeloma patients in this study received single cycle doses ranging from approximately 20mCi to 95mCi TBD. An independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that all doses used were safe and well-tolerated by patients.

CLR 131 in combination with dexamethasone was under investigation in adult patients with r/r MM. Patients had to be refractory to or relapsed from at least one proteasome inhibitor and at least one immunomodulatory agent. The clinical study was a standard three-plus-three dose escalation safety study to determine the maximum tolerable dose. Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of the plasma cells and is the second most common form of hematologic cancers. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of therapeutic activity by assessing surrogate efficacy markers, which include M protein, free light chain (FLC), PFS and OS. All patients were heavily pretreated with an average of five prior lines of therapy. CLR 131 was deemed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to be safe and tolerable up to its planned maximum single, bolus dose of 31.25 mCi/m2 or a TBD of ~63 mCi. The four single dose cohorts examined were: 12.5 mCi/m2 (~25mCi TBD), 18.75 mCi/m2 (~37.5mCi TBD), 25 mCi/m2(~50mCi TBD), and 31.25 mCi/m2(~62.5mCi TBD), all in combination with low dose dexamethasone (40 mg weekly). Of the five patients in the first cohort, four achieved stable disease and one patient progressed at Day 15 after administration and was taken off the study. Of the five patients admitted to the second cohort, all five achieved stable disease however one patient progressed at Day 41 after administration and was taken off the study. Four patients were enrolled to the third cohort and all achieved stable disease. In September 2017, we announced results for cohort 4, showing that a single infusion up to 30-minutes of 31.25mCi/m2 of CLR 131 was safe and tolerated by the three patients in the cohort. Additionally, all three patients experienced CBR with one patient achieving a partial response (PR). We use the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) definitions of response, which involve monitoring the surrogate markers of efficacy, M protein and FLC. The IMWG defines a PR as a greater than or equal to 50% decrease in FLC levels (for patients in whom M protein is unmeasurable) or 50% or greater decrease in M protein. The patient experiencing a PR had an 82% reduction in FLC. This patient did not produce M protein, had received seven prior lines of treatment including radiation, stem cell transplantation and multiple triple combination treatments including one with daratumumab that was not tolerated. One patient experiencing stable disease attained a 44% reduction in M protein. In January 2019, we announced that the pooled mOS data from the first four cohorts was 22.0 months. In late 2018, we modified this study to evaluate a fractionated dosing strategy to potentially increase efficacy and decrease adverse events.
 
Cohort 5 and 6 were fractionated cohorts of 31.25 mCi/m2(~62.5mCi TBD) and 37.5 mCi/m2(~75mCi TBD), each administered on day 1 and on day 8. Following the determination that all prior dosing cohorts were safe and tolerated, we initiated a cohort 7 utilizing a 40mCi/m2 (~95mCi TBD) fractionated dose administered 20mCi/m2 (~40mCi TBD) on days 1 and day 8. Cohort 7 was the highest pre-planned dose cohort and subjects have completed the evaluation period. The study completed enrollment and the final clinical study report is expected in the first half of 2021.
 
In May 2019, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for CLR 131 in fourth line or later r/r MM. CLR 131 is our small molecule radiotherapeutic PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. It is currently being evaluated in our ongoing CLOVER-1 Phase 2 clinical study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other select B-cell lymphomas.
 
Phase 1 Study in r/r Pediatric Patients with select Solid tumors, Lymphomas and Malignant Brain Tumors
 
In December 2017 the Division of Oncology at the FDA accepted our IND and study design for the Phase 1 study of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with select rare and orphan designated cancers. This study was initiated during the first quarter of 2019. In December 2017, we filed an IND application for r/r pediatric patients with select solid tumors, lymphomas and malignant brain tumors. The Phase 1 clinical study of CLR 131 is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with cancers including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and malignant brain tumors. Secondary objectives of the study are to identify the recommended efficacious dose of CLR 131 and to determine preliminary antitumor activity (treatment response) of CLR 131 in children and adolescents. In August 2020, it was announced that four dose levels 15mCi/m2 up to 60mCi/m2 were deemed safe and tolerable by an independent Data Monitoring Committee and evaluation of the next higher dose cohort, 75mCi/m2 was initiated. In November 2020, we announced that CLR 131 had been measured in tumors, confirming that systemic administration of CLR 131 crosses the blood brain barrier and is delivered into tumors and that disease control has been exhibited in heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas. In 2018, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Should CLR 131 be approved for any of these pediatric indications, the first approved RPDD would enable us to receive a priority review voucher. Priority review vouchers can be used by the sponsor to receive priority review for a future New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) submission, which would reduce the FDA review time from 12 months to six months. Currently, these vouchers can also be transferred or sold to another entity. In December 2020, the FDA extended the Priority Review Voucher Program through September 2026 for rare pediatric diseases.

Phase 1 Study in r/r Head and Neck Cancer
 
In August 2016, the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (“UWCCC”) was awarded a five-year Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (“SPORE”) grant of $12,000,000 from the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to improve treatments and outcomes for head and neck cancer, HNC, patients. HNC is the sixth most common cancer across the world with approximately 56,000 new patients diagnosed every year in the U.S. As a key component of this grant, the UWCCC researchers completed testing of CLR 131 in various animal HNC models and initiated the first human clinical study enrolling up to 30 patients combining CLR 131 and external beam radiation with recurrent HNC in Q4 2019. This clinical study was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic over the first three quarters of 2020 but is now open and actively enrolling patients.
Preclinical Pipeline
 
We believe our PDC platform has potential to provide targeted delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads, as exemplified by the product candidates listed below, that may result in improvements upon current standard of care (“SOC”) for the treatment of a broad range of human cancers:

· | CLR 1900 Series is an internally developed proprietary PDC program leveraging a novel small molecule cytotoxic compound as the payload. The payload inhibits mitosis (cell division) and targets a key pathway required to inhibit rapidly dividing cells that results in apoptosis. We believe that this program could produce a product candidate targeted to select solid tumors. Currently, the program is in early preclinical development and if we elect to progress any molecules further, we will select preferred candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CLR 2000 Series is a collaborative PDC program with Avicenna Oncology, or Avicenna, that we entered into in July 2017. Avicenna is a developer of antibody drug conjugates (“ADCs”). The objective of the research collaboration is to design and develop a series of PDCs utilizing Avicenna’s proprietary cytotoxic payload. Although Avicenna is a developer of ADCs, this collaboration was sought as a means to overcome many of the challenges associated with ADCs, including those associated with the targeting of specific cell surface epitopes. The CLR 2000 Series has demonstrated improved safety, efficacy and tissue distribution with the cytotoxic payload in animal models. A candidate molecule and a back-up have been selected for further advancement at a future time.

· | CLR 12120 Series is a collaborative PDC program with Orano Med for the development of novel PDCs utilizing Orano Med’s unique alpha emitter, lead 212 conjugated to our phospholipid ether; the companies intend to evaluate the new PDCs in up to three oncology indications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology Overview
 
Our product candidates are based on a cancer-targeting delivery platform of optimized phospholipid ether (PLE) analogs (phospholipid ether proprietary delivery vehicle) that interact with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of a cell’s membrane phospholipid bilayer that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids and serve to organize cell surface and intracellular signaling molecules. As a result of enrichment and stabilization of lipid rafts in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, our product candidates provide selective targeting preferentially to cancer cells over normal healthy cells. The cancer-targeting PLE delivery vehicle was deliberately designed to be combined with therapeutic, diagnostic and imaging molecules. For example, the cytotoxic radioisotope, iodine-131 can be attached via a stable covalent bond to the PLE resulting in our lead PDC, CLR 131. Non-radioactive molecules, including many classes of small molecule chemotherapeutic compounds, peptides and other molecules can also be attached to the delivery vehicle.

In parallel to advancing the clinical development of our lead PDC, CLR 131 in both adult and pediatric orphan indications; we remain focused on exploring the creation of additional PDCs ranging from newly discovered to well-characterized anti-cancer agent payloads. The objective is to develop PDC chemotherapeutics through conjugation of our delivery vehicle and non-targeted anti-cancer agents to improve therapeutic indices and expand potential indications through the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads. Initial PDC product candidates include our CLR 1900, 2000 and 12120 series of conjugated compounds currently being researched independently and through partnerships. Other than CLR 12120, all are small-molecule, cancer-targeting chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical research. To date, multiple cancer-targeting product profiles have been generated from a single chemical core structure that is the foundation of our technology platform. We also believe that additional cytotoxic PDCs may be developed possessing enhanced therapeutic indices versus the original, non-targeted cytotoxic payload as a monotherapy.
 
Malignant tumor targeting, including targeting of cancer stem cells, has been demonstrated in vivo in animal models as well as in clinical studies. Mice without intact immune systems and inoculated with Panc-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) cells, were injected with CLR 1502, 24 or 96 hours prior to imaging. In vivo optical imaging showed pronounced accumulation of CLR 1502 in tumors versus non-target organs and tissues. Similarly, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumor-bearing animals (colon, glioma, triple negative breast and pancreatic tumor xenograft models) administered the imaging agent CLR 124 clearly shows selective uptake and retention by both primary tumors and metastases, including cancer stem cells. PET/CT analysis following co-injection of CLR 131 (for therapy) and CLR 124 (for imaging) revealed time-dependent tumor responses and disappearance over nine days in a cancer xenograft model. We believe that the capability of our technology to target and be selectively retained by cancer stem cells in vivo, was demonstrated by treating glioma stem cell-derived orthotopic tumor-bearing mice with another fluorescent-labeled PDC (CLR 1501), and then removing the tumor and isolating cancer stem cells, which continued to display CLR 1501 labeling even after three weeks in cell culture.
 
The basis for selective tumor targeting of our compounds lies in differences between the plasma membranes of cancer cells as compared to those of most normal cells. Data suggests that lipid rafts serve as portals of entry for PDCs such as CLR 131 and our multiple series of drug conjugates. The marked selectivity of our compounds for cancer cells versus non-cancer cells likely results from cancer cells maintenance of an overabundance of lipid rafts and the stabilization of these microdomains within the plasma membrane as compared to normal cells. Following cell entry via lipid rafts, CLR 131 is transported into the cytoplasm, where it traffics along the Golgi apparatus and is distributed to various peri-nuclear organelles (including mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum). The pivotal role played by lipid rafts is underscored by the fact that disruption of lipid raft architecture significantly eliminates uptake of our PDC delivery vehicle into cancer cells.
 
Products in Development
 
CLR 131
 
CLR 131 is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 (radioisotope) directly to cancer cells, while limiting exposure to healthy cells unlike many traditional on-market treatment options. CLR 131 is comprised of our proprietary PLE, 18-(p-[I-131]iodophenyl) octadacyl phosphocholine, acting as a cancer-targeting delivery and retention vehicle, covalently labeled with iodine-131, a cytotoxic (cell-killing) radioisotope with a half-life of eight days that is already in common use to treat thyroid, pediatric tumors and other cancer types including NHL. It is this “intracellular radiation” mechanism of cancer cell killing, coupled with delivery to a wide range of malignant tumor types that we believe provides CLR 131 with anti-cancer activity and a unique product profile. Selective uptake and retention have been demonstrated in cancer stem cells compared with normal cells, offering the prospect of longer lasting anti-cancer activity.

The primary objective of the multicenter Phase 1b dose-escalation study in patients with a range of advanced solid tumors was to define the MTD of CLR 131. In addition to determining the MTD, the Phase 1b study was intended to evaluate overall tumor response (using standard RESIST 1.1 criteria) and safety. In September 2012, we announced that we had successfully completed the second cohort in this Phase 1b dose-escalation study. Dose escalation in four cohorts subsequently occurred with refractory cancer patients receiving single doses of 25 mCi/m2, 31.25 mCi/m2 or 37.5 mCi/m2.
 
Tumor treatment with radioactive isotopes has been used as a fundamental cancer therapeutic for decades. The goals of targeted cancer therapy — selective delivery of effective doses of isotopes that destroy tumor tissue, sparing of surrounding normal tissue, and non-accumulation in vital organs such as the liver and kidneys — remain goals of new therapies as well. We believe our targeted delivery technology has the potential to achieve these goals. CLR 131 has been shown in animal models to reliably and near-universally accumulate in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells.

In view of CLR 131’s selective uptake and retention in a wide range of solid tumors and in cancer stem cells, its single-agent efficacy in animal models and its non-specific mechanism of cancer-killing (radiation), along with an understanding of classical oncology drug development our initial plan was to develop CLR 131 as a monotherapy for cancer indications with significant unmet medical need. CLR 131’s unique benefits such as a novel mechanism of action, ease of administration, and positive benefit/risk profile offered potential treatment benefits for a variety of high unmet cancer populations. While a number of cancer indications were evaluated as the initial target treatment, multiple myeloma was selected principally because, like many hematologic malignancies, is known to be highly radiosensitive and remained an incurable hematologic disease with significant unmet medical need in the relapse or refractory clinical setting. Additionally, MM is designated as an orphan disease and drugs granted an orphan drug designation (ODD) are provided regulatory and marketing exclusivity benefits. The IND application for MM was accepted by the FDA in September 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted ODD for CLR 131 for the treatment of MM. We initiated our Phase 1 Study of CLR 131 for the treatment of r/r MM in April 2015. The Phase 1 study was a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CLR 131 administered as a 15-20-minute IV infusion, either as a single bolus dose or as two fractionated doses, in patients with R/R MM. All cohorts dosed were deemed safe and well tolerated by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The study was successfully completed in February 2020.
 
In February 2020, final results from a multicenter, phase 1 clinical trial of CLR 131 in r/r MM were presented. The trial was designed to evaluate the safety and potential initial efficacy of CLR 131 in heavily pretreated MM patients and enrolled a total of 26 evaluable patients at three trial sites. For the trial, which used a modified 3 + 3 dose escalation design, 15 evaluable patients were dosed in single bolus doses from 12.5mCi/m2 up to 31.25mCi/m2 (TBD 20.35-59.17 mCi) and 11 evaluable patients were dosed in fractionated dosing cohorts of 31.25mCi/m2 to 40mCi/m2 (TBD 54.915-89.107 mCi). An independent data monitoring committee determined that no dose-limiting toxicities were seen in any cohort. Of the 26 evaluable patients in the trial, a partial response was seen in 4 of 26 patients (15.4%) and stable disease or minimal response in 22 of 26 patients (84.6%), for a disease control rate of 100%. A significant decrease in M-protein and FLC was also observed, suggesting ample targeting of the tumor.
 
The Phase 2 A study (CLOVER-1) of CLR 131 was initiated in July 2017 and conducted in approximately 10 leading cancer centers in the United States for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell hematologic cancers. The hematologic cancers being studied in the trial included MM, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) / Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
 
The planned study enrollment was up to 80 patients. Its primary endpoint was clinical benefit response (CBR), with additional endpoints of ORR, progression free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS) and other markers of efficacy. Over the course of the study the dosing regimen of CLR 131 advanced from a single bolus dose to two cycles of fractionated administrations of 15 mCi/m2 per dose on days 1, 15 (cycle 1), and days 57, 71 (cycle 2).
 
In September 2020, we announced that a 40% ORR was observed in the subset of r/r MM deemed triple class refractory who received 60 mCi or greater TBD. Triple class refractory is defined as patients that are refractory to immunomodulatory, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 antibody drug classes. The 40% ORR (6/15 patients) represents triple class refractory patients enrolled in Part A of our CLOVER-1 study and additional patients enrolled in Part B from March through May 2020 and received >60mCi TBD. All MM patients enrolled in the expansion cohort are required to be triple class refractory. The six patients enrolled from March through May 2020 were heavily pre-treated with an average of nine prior multi-drug regimens. Three patients received a TBD of > 60 mCi and three received less than 60 mCi. Consistent with the data released in February 2020, patients receiving > 60 mCi typically exhibit greater responses. Based on study results to date, patients continue to tolerate CLR 131 well, with the most common and almost exclusive treatment emergent adverse events being cytopenias. This cohort will continue to enroll and evaluate patients that are even more refractory (quad-class refractory (proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, anti-CD-38 antibodies, nuclear export inhibitors, or BCMA antibody drug conjugates) or hepta-drug refractory) to determine if CLR 131 at the dose of >60mCi TBD can be effective in patients that likely have no alternative therapies.
 
Data from our Phase 2 CLOVER-1 clinical study show that six WM patients demonstrated 100% ORR and an 83.3% major response rate with one patient achieving a CR, which continues at nearly 27 months post- last treatment. While median treatment free survival (or treatment free remission) and duration of response has not been reached, the average treatment free survival is currently at 330 days. This may represent an important improvement in the treatment of r/r WM as we believe no approved or late-stage development treatments for second- and third-line patients have reported a CR nor do any therapies provide any significant benefit after the therapy is stopped.

In January 2021, we announced the initiation of the CLOVER-WaM pivotal study in WM. The study is designed as a global, non-comparator, single arm, study of CLR 131. We believe this design is in alignment with the feedback received from the FDA during the guidance meeting held in September 2020.
 
The study will enroll 50 WM patients who have failed first-line therapy and have failed or had a suboptimal response to a BTK i (i.e. ibrutinib). Patients in the trial will receive up to 4-doses of CLR 131 over two cycles (cycle one days 1, 15, and cycle two days 57, 71). The primary endpoint of the trial is major response rate (MRR) as defined as a partial response (a minimum of a 50% reduction in IgM) or better in patients that receive a minimum TBD of 60 mCi with secondary endpoints of treatment free survival (treatment free remission), duration of response and progression free survival. An independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will perform an interim safety and futility evaluation on the first 10 patients enrolled. The assessment will occur patient by patient and will conclude after the tenth patient is evaluated; there is no planned study stoppage. The trial has been initiated at select US cancer centers and will roll out to additional US and international sites in early 2021.
 
In July 2018, we announced that after a single 25mCi/m2 IV administration of CLR 131, patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive DLBCL were assessed for response. These interim data show a 33% ORR and a 50% CBR. In addition, the observed responses to date show overall tumor reduction ranged from 60% to greater than 90%. As a result of these favorable outcomes, we have expanded this cohort to include up to 30 additional patients. We also announced that a patient in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) arm with advanced Waldenstrom macroglobulinema showed a 94% reduction in tumor burden and complete resolution in four of five targeted masses after two doses of CLR 131 separated by 123 days.
 
In December 2017, we filed an IND application with the Division of Oncology at the FDA for a proposed Phase 1 study of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with select rare and orphan designated cancers. The Phase 1 pediatric study is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancers, including malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, sarcomas, and lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma). The Phase 1 study was initiated in 2019 at 3 pediatric cancer centers and is currently being conducted internationally at seven leading pediatric cancer centers. Secondary objectives of the study are to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose of CLR 131 and to determine preliminary antitumor activity (treatment response) of CLR 131 in children and adolescents.
 
In November 2020, we announced that CLR 131 demonstrated preliminary activity in inoperable brain tumors as part of the Phase 1 study. Similar to previous CLR 131 studies in adults, this study demonstrated that 20-40% of the infused CLR 131 is delivered to cancer tumors. Additionally, the study demonstrated that systemic administration of CLR 131 results in a sufficient proportion of infused drug crossing the blood brain barrier and is delivered to different types of malignant brain tumors. CLR 131 has achieved disease control at multiple dose levels in rapidly progressing, heavily pretreated patients, including two patients at distinct dose levels with rapidly growing ependymomas. Pediatric HGGs are a collection of aggressive brain and central nervous system tumor subtypes (i.e. diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, glioblastomas, astrocytomas, ependymomas, etc.) with about 400 new pediatric cases diagnosed annually in the United States. Children with these tumors have a poor prognosis and limited 5-year survival.
 
The FDA has granted ODD’s and RPDDs for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Should any of these indications reach approval, the RPDD may enable us to receive a priority review voucher. Priority review vouchers can be used by the sponsor to receive Priority Review for a future NDA or BLA submission, which would reduce the statutory FDA review time from 12 months to six months. Currently, these vouchers can also be transferred or sold to another entity.

Market Overview
 
Our target market is broad and represents the market for the treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated that approximately 1.90 million new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2019 and approximately 608,570 cancer deaths in the U.S.1 The global market for cancer drugs reached $143 billion in annual sales (2019), and could reach $250 billion by 2024, according to a report dated September 2020 by McKinsey & Company.2 This growth will be driven by emerging targeted therapies, which are expected to change the cancer treatment landscape (Cowen Report), and an increased use of cancer drug combination regimens.
 
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia
 
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare and incurable disease defined by specific genotypic subtypes that defines patient responses and long-term outcomes. The annual incidence is 6,500 with prevalence of approximately 60,000 patients globally. WM is a lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic system. The disease occurs in a type of white blood cell called a B-lymphocyte or B-cell, which normally matures into a plasma cell whose job is to manufacture immunoglobulins (antibodies) to help the body fight infection. In WM, there is a malignant change to the B-cell in the late stages of maturing, and it continues to proliferate into a clone of identical cells, primarily in the bone marrow but also in the lymph nodes and other tissues and organs of the lymphatic system. These clonal cells over-produce an antibody of a specific class called IgM.
 
WM cells have characteristics of both cancerous B-lymphocytes (NHL) and plasma cells (multiple myeloma), and they are called lymphoplasmacytic cells. For that reason, WM is classified as a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). About 95% of LPL cases are WM; the remaining 5% do not secrete IgM and consequently are not classified as WM.
 
Several drugs have demonstrated activity either alone or in combinations but only a single drug has received regulatory approval. Treatment is mainly focused on the control of symptoms and the prevention of organ damage. Front-line treatments for WM include rituximab alone or in combination with other agents. In the salvage therapy (second line or later) setting, ibrutinib, combinations of proteosome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs and stem cell transplantation are considered. Ibrutinib is the only drug to receive regulatory approval (2015) as a salvage therapy; in late 2019, it was approved for front-line treatment in combination with rituximab. Factors such as long-term cytopenias, age, hyper viscosity, the need for quick disease control, lymphadenopathy, co-morbidities, and IgM-related end-organ damage are key consideration in the choice of treatment.
 
Multiple Myeloma 
 
According to the National Cancer Institute SEER database, multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer with a U.S. incidence rate and a relapse or refractory patient population of 10,000 to 15,000. In 2019, Global Data Research Group estimated the multiple myeloma dollar market size to be over $20B in 2021 and is forecasted to increase to nearly $28B in 2027. The increase in drug sales over this period will be mainly driven by the increasing incidence of multiple myeloma with the U.S. market remaining the largest potential market. It is believed the largest growth will occur in patients receiving at least three lines of treatment due to the expanding elderly population, increases in treatment population and increasing rates of survival from earlier lines of treatment. According to data obtained from Decision Resource Group, over 40% of patients in later lines of therapy while eligible, refuse treatment due to higher treatment failure, severity of adverse events and difficulty of treatment dosing regimen. The average response rates for patients receiving their fourth- and fifth-line treatment are 15% and 8% response rates respectively. Additionally, the mOS for these patients also decreases by line of therapy and is less than 9 months post third-line treatment.
 
Based on the CLR 131 Phase 1 and Phase 2 product profile demonstrated in fifth-line patients to date with a single dose, we believe CLR 131 may meet the unmet medical need in the heavily pre-treated patient population described above.

B-Cell Lymphoma
 
B-cell lymphoma represents cancers of the lymphatic system. The lymphoma may be indolent or aggressive and circulates in the blood or form tumors in lymph nodes. According to the WHO Global Cancer Observatory database, the estimated 2020 US incidence of B-Cell Lymphoma was 66,289 cases.9 Types of B-Cell Lymphomas include Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, and the most common lymphoma, DLBCL. According to a report dated June 2019 by Global Data Research Group, the B-cell Lymphoma market was valued at $5.7 billion for 2017, with a forecasted increase to $9.2 billion in 2027 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.9%.
 
 We believe there is a significant unmet medical need in B-cell lymphoma due to continued high mortality and poor response rates remain in second- and third- line treatments compounded by the limited durability of responses.


Based on the CLR 131 Phase 2 product profile demonstrated in DLBCL patients to date with a single dose, we believe CLR 131 may meet the unmet medical need in the patient population described above as well.
 
Neuroblastoma
 
Neuroblastoma, a neoplasm of the sympathetic nervous system, is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, accounting for approximately 7.8% of childhood cancers in the U.S. The National Cancer Institute states the incidence is about 10.54 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years and 90% are younger than 5 years at diagnosis. Over 650 new cases are diagnosed each year in North America. Approximately 50% of patients present with metastatic disease requiring systemic treatment. Clinical consequences include abdominal distension, proptosis, bone pain, pancytopenia, fever and paralysis. Although the prognosis is favorable in children under one year of age with an 86 to 95% 5-year survival, in children aged one to 14 years the 5-year survival ranges from 34 to 68%.
Sarcomas
 
Sarcomas represent a heterogeneous disease group. Sarcomas grow in connective tissue, or cells that connect or support other kinds of tissue in the body. These tumors are most common in the bones, muscles, tendons, cartilage, nerves and blood vessels. Sarcomas represent 15% of all pediatric tumors and 21% of pediatric solid tumors. The National Cancer Institute SEER data base estimates that there were 2,060 incidences in 2019. The median age at diagnosis was 3, the median age of death was 5. 
 
We are focused on 3 subsets of Sarcomas:
 

· | Osteosarcoma: The tumor develops in growing bone tissues, accounts for 28% of all bone sarcomas and is the most common pediatric sarcoma (56%).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ewing’s Sarcoma: The tumor develops in immature tissues in bone marrow.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rhabdomyosarcoma: Tumors develop in the muscles predominately skeletal muscle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on information from Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast, the global market value of the Pediatric Sarcoma Market is expected to nearly double from $324 million in 2018 to $635 million in 2025. This growth is expected to be driven by the high rate of recurrence in pediatrics, increased incidence in select markets and new high-priced therapies coming to the market.
 
Manufacturing
 
CLR 131 drug product is made via a five-step synthetic scheme. The release specifications for the drug product have been established and validated. Through process improvements, we have been able to achieve a longer expiry dating for the compound extending finished product shelf-life to further facilitate ex-U.S. distribution from North America.
 
We have successfully executed large scale production of the drug substance via a contract manufacturing organization that has been inspected and approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. We have also demonstrated 60-month stability for the drug substance in desiccated and refrigerated forms at small scale and are replicating this at large scale. 
 
14

 

Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization (”CPDC”), a validated Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) manufacturing organization specializing in radiopharmaceuticals, as our exclusive source to supply drug product for our ongoing research and clinical studies, including our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of CLR 131. We believe that CPDC and our other third-party manufactures have the ability to supply large scale clinical and commercial scale material.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to pursue and evaluate all available options to develop, launch and commercialize our compounds. These options presently include but are not limited to: entering into an agreement for a contract sales organization (CSO) or partnering arrangement with one or more biotechnology or pharmaceutical company with strong product development and commercialization expertise and distribution infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and/or Japan. While we currently do not plan to build our own commercial organization for the launch and commercialization of our compounds, we may reconsider that in the future.
Potential Commercial Competition to Our Current and Future Clinical-Stage Compounds
 
Currently, many classes of approved products with various mechanisms of action exist, including: immune-modulating agents, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, and traditional chemotherapeutics for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. There also remain a significant number of compounds being researched and developed for the treatment of cancer. We are focused on the product development and commercialization of adult and pediatric orphan designated indications with unmet clinical need. While multiple adult hematology indications for CLR 131 were evaluated, WM was selected based on CLR 131’s efficacy and safety profile demonstrated to date. Other considerations such as the regulatory pathway, unmet clinical need, limited commercial competition and cost efficiencies were also assessed. We believe CLR 131 is a therapeutic option in either adult or pediatric relapse or refractory settings either as a monotherapy or in combination with currently approved agents, some of which are radio-sensitizing and maintain a differential adverse event profile from that of CLR 131.
Intellectual Property
 
Our core technology platform is based on research conducted at the University of Michigan in 1994, where phospholipid ether analogs were initially designed, synthesized, radiolabeled, and evaluated. This research was transferred to the University of Wisconsin - Madison between 1998 and the subsequent founding of Cellectar in 2002 to further develop and commercialize the technology. We obtained exclusive rights to the related technology patents owned by University of Michigan in 2003 and continued development of the PDC platform while obtaining ownership of numerous additional patents and patent applications (with various expiry until 2034 without extensions). We have established a broad U.S. and international intellectual property rights portfolio around our proprietary cancer-targeting PLE technology platform including CLR 131 and our PDC Programs.
 
PDC chemotherapeutic Programs
 
In November 2015, we converted our previously filed provisional patent application for Phospholipid-Ether Analogs as Cancer Targeting Drug Vehicles to non-provisional US and International (PCT) patent applications and were published by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office (USPTO) in May of 2016. These patent applications further protect composition of matter and method of use for PDCs developed with our proprietary phospholipid-ether delivery vehicle conjugated with any existing or future cytotoxic agents, including chemotherapeutics for targeted delivery to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Additional cytotoxic PDC compounds are covered by pending patent applications directed to the composition of matter and method of use for cancer therapy provide intellectual property protection in the U.S. and up to 148 additional countries. These applications, if granted, offer protection extending through at least 2035 in the U.S. and key international markets.

CLR 131
 
We have taken a broad approach to creating market exclusivity for CLR 131 both within the U.S., and globally, including all major markets. This approach includes numerous patents, patent applications and regulatory filings to provide maximum market exclusivity. Our patent portfolio for CLR 131 includes all of the typical filings as well as unique methods of use, methods of manufacturing, use in combinations, use to treat cancer stem cells, novel formulations, etc. In addition, to our patents, we were granted ODD for CLR 131 by the FDA for the treatment of MM in December 2014 and for WM in January 2020. In addition, we received ODD from the European Union for MM in September 2019, and for WM in January 2021. We expect to file additional orphan designations for other rare diseases. We continue to evaluate CLR 131 in additional hematologic and solid tumor orphan designated indications. Our patents have a variety expected expiry with some potentially being extended on a country-by-country basis. In 2018, the FDA a granted orphan drug and a RPDD for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. We initiated a Phase 1 study in 2019.
 
We expect to continue to file patent applications and acquire licenses to other patents covering methods of use, composition of matter, formulation, method of manufacture and other patentable claims related to CLR 131 and new PDCs. These patent applications will be filed in key commercial markets worldwide. The issued patents will generally expire between 2025 and 2035, unless extended, most likely under clinical development extensions.
 
In addition to the above noted patents/applications directed to CLR 131 and our PDC pipeline portfolio, we own other patents/applications directed to different forms of phospholipid ethers, methods of use and methods of manufacturing of phospholipid ethers.
 
Separate from any patent protection and following product approval by regulatory authorities, data exclusivity may be available for various compounds for up to 10 years on a country-by-country basis (e.g., up to five years in the U.S. and up to ten years in Europe).
 
Licenses / Collaborations 
 
In August 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Orano Med for the development of novel PDCs utilizing Orano Med’s alpha emitter lead-212 conjugated to our phospholipid ether; the companies intend to evaluate the new PDCs in up to three oncology indications.
 
In July 2017, we entered into an arrangement with Avicenna Oncology GMBH (Avicenna). Under this arrangement, Avicenna will provide us a selection of its proprietary toxins. We will use our proprietary conjugation capabilities to proceed with the conjugation in order to obtain PDCs. We will process various in vitro and in cellulo screening against such PDCs to develop new conjugates. We granted Avicenna an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive license to our intellectual property with respect to each conjugate developed. In the event the parties cannot reach agreement on the terms of a definitive agreement despite good faith negotiations, Avicenna’s exclusive option terminates as to such conjugate. Avicenna also granted to us an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive license to its intellectual property with respect to the material provided. In the event the parties do not reach agreement on the terms of a definitive agreement, our exclusive option terminates as to the material of Avicenna. 
 
Research and Development
 
Our primary activity to date has been research and development. The research had historically been conducted at our facility in Madison, Wisconsin and through third-party laboratories and academic universities. Starting in 2018, we no longer used the facility in Madison, Wisconsin for these activities. The clinical development has been completed primarily through contract research organizations at hospitals and academic centers. We have established a collaboration outsourcing model to leverage third-party expertise, accelerate project timelines, improve productivity and limit spend and fixed costs. Our research and development expenses were approximately $10,141,000 and $8,996,000 for 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Regulation
 
The production, distribution, and marketing of products employing our technology, and our development activities, are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA, as well as to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including radioactive isotopes. These laws, and similar laws outside the U.S., govern the clinical and pre-clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record-keeping, reporting, advertising, and promotion of drugs. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, if successful, will take many years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the delay in approving or refusal to approve a product by the FDA or other health authorities. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, which include civil money penalties, injunctions, seizure of regulated product, and civil and criminal charges. The following paragraphs provide further information on certain legal and regulatory issues with a particular potential to affect our operations or future marketing of products employing our technology.
U.S. Research, Development, and Product Approval Process
 
The research, development, and approval process in the U.S. and elsewhere is intensive and rigorous and generally takes many years to complete. The typical process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug may be marketed in the U.S. includes:

• | pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations, referred to herein as GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may commence;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | human clinical studies performed under the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices regulations, to evaluate the drug’s safety and effectiveness for its intended uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of whether the facility in which the drug is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued quality; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of a marketing application to the FDA, and approval of the application by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-Clinical Testing
 
During pre-clinical testing, studies are performed with respect to the chemical and physical properties of candidate formulations. These studies are subject to GLP requirements. Biological testing is typically done in animal models to demonstrate the activity of the compound against the targeted disease or condition and to assess the apparent effects of the new product candidate on various organ systems, as well as its relative therapeutic effectiveness and safety.
 
Submission of IND
 
An IND must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before studies in humans may commence. The IND must include a sufficient amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling.
  
Clinical Studies
 
Clinical study programs in humans generally follow a three-phase process. Typically, Phase 1 studies are conducted in small numbers of healthy volunteers or, on occasion, in patients afflicted with the target disease. Phase 1 studies are conducted to determine the metabolic and pharmacological action of the product candidate in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, studies are generally conducted in larger groups of patients having the target disease or condition in order to validate clinical endpoints, and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the product candidate and optimal dosing. This phase also helps determine further the safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical studies are generally conducted in patients having the target disease or condition to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of effectiveness and safety of the product candidate as required by U.S. regulatory agencies.
 
17

 


In the case of products for certain serious or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing may be done in patients with the disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Because these patients are already afflicted with the target disease or condition, it is possible that such studies will also provide results traditionally obtained in Phase 2 studies. These studies are often referred to as “Phase 1/2” studies. However, even if patients participate in initial human testing and a Phase 1/2 study is carried out, the sponsor is still responsible for obtaining all the data usually obtained in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.
 
U.S. law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be “adequate and well controlled.” In general, this means that either a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as a reference control. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with good clinical practice requirements, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. The clinical study process for a new compound can take ten years or more to complete. The FDA may prevent clinical studies from beginning or may place clinical studies on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Studies may also be prevented from beginning or may be terminated by institutional review boards, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical studies can delay, impede, or prevent marketing authorization. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing authorization can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
Submission of NDA
 
Following the completion of clinical studies, the data are analyzed to determine whether the studies successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness and whether a product approval application may be submitted. In the U.S., if the product is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling. 
 
Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and must be registered with the FDA. The application generally will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process and determines that the facility is in compliance with cGMP requirements.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees can be significant. For fiscal year 2020, the NDA review fee alone is $2,942,965, although we may qualify for a waiver of these FDA filing fees since we are a small business entity. 
 
Each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 45 to 60 days following submission of the application. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs— six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time.
 
Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, typically is not an actual approval but an “action letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. The FDA’s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval.

Post NDA Regulation
 
Significant legal and regulatory requirements also apply after FDA approval to market under an NDA. These include, among other things, requirements related to adverse event and other reporting, product advertising and promotion, and ongoing adherence to cGMP requirements, as well as the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product labeling, or manufacturing process. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.
 
The regulatory framework applicable to the production, distribution, marketing and/or sale of our product pipeline may change significantly from the current descriptions provided herein in the time that it may take for any of our products to reach a point at which an NDA is approved.
 
Overall research, development, and approval times depend on a number of factors, including the period of review at FDA, the number of questions posed by the FDA during review, how long it takes to respond to the FDA’s questions, the severity or life-threatening nature of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, the availability of clinical investigators and eligible patients, the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical studies, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical studies.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws. 
 
Our research and development, manufacturing, and administration of our drugs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive materials, such as radioactive isotopes. Therefore, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of these materials and some waste products and are required to maintain both a manufacturer’s license and a radioactive materials license with State of Wisconsin agencies.
 
Moreover, we are now, and may become subject to, additional federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and/or the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of human tissue, waste, and hazardous substances, including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work.
 
Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 
We, and any future collaborative partners, may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations that may be quite different from those of the FDA governing clinical studies, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or any future collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in these countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current U.S. law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.

Reimbursement and Pricing Controls

In many of the markets where we, or any future collaborative partners would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. For example, in the case of Medicare coverage for physician-administered oncology drugs, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, with certain exceptions, prohibits Medicare carriers from refusing to cover unapproved uses of an FDA-approved drug if the unapproved use is supported by one or more citations in the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, or the U.S. Pharmacopoeia Drug Information. Another commonly cited compendium, for example under Medicaid, is the DRUGDEX Information System.
