When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Lovesac” and the “Company” mean The Lovesac Company.



Company Overview



We are a technology driven company that designs, manufactures and sells unique, high quality furniture derived through our proprietary Designed for Life philosophy which results in products that are built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve as our customers’ lives do. Our current product offering is comprised of modular couches called Sactionals, premium foam beanbag chairs called Sacs, and their associated home decor accessories. Innovation is at the center of our design philosophy with all of our core products protected by a robust portfolio of utility patents. We market and sell our products primarily online directly at www.lovesac.com, supported by direct-to-consumer touch-feel points in the form of our own showrooms as well as through shop-in-shops and pop-up-shops with third party retailers. We believe that our ecommerce centric approach, coupled with our ability to deliver our large upholstered products through express couriers, is unique to the furniture industry.



The name “Lovesac” was derived from our original innovative product, a premium foam beanbag chair, the Sac. The Sac was developed in 1995 and provided the foundation for the Company. We believe that the large size, comfortable foam filling and irreverent branding of our Sacs products have been instrumental in growing a loyal customer base and our positive, fun image. Our Sacs represented 14.0% and 17.0% of our sales for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.



Our Sactionals product line currently represents a majority of our sales. Sactionals are a couch system that consists of two components, seats and sides, which can be arranged, rearranged and expanded into thousands of configurations easily and without tools. Our Sactional products include a number of patented features relating to their geometry and modularity, coupling mechanisms and other features. We believe that these high quality premium priced products enhance our brand image and customer loyalty and expect them to continue to garner a significant share of our sales.



Our Sactionals represented 84.5% and 80.7% of our sales for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sacs and Sactionals come in a wide variety of colors and fabrics that allow consumers to customize their purchases in numerous configurations and styles. We provide lifetime warranties on our Sactionals frames and the foam used in both product lines, and 3-year warranties on our covers. Our Designed for Life trademark reflects our dynamic product line that is built to last and evolve throughout a customer’s life. Customers can continually update their Sacs and Sactionals with new covers, additions and configurations to accommodate changes in their family and housing situations.



The Company was formed in the State of Delaware on January 3, 2017, in connection with a corporate reorganization with SAC Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the predecessor entity to the Company. Our common stock began trading on Nasdaq under the symbol “LOVE” on June 27, 2018 and we consummated our initial public offering of shares of our common stock, or our IPO, on June 29, 2018.

Product Overview



Our products serve as a set of building blocks that can be rearranged, restyled and re-upholstered with any new setting, mitigating constant changes in fashion and style. They are built to last and evolve throughout a customer’s life.

● | Sactionals. Our Sactional product line currently represents a majority of our net sales. We believe our Sactionals platform is unlike competing products in its adaptability yet is comparable aesthetically to similarly priced premium couches and sectionals. Our Sactional products include a number of patented features relating to their geometry and modularity, coupling mechanisms and other features. Utilizing only two, standardized pieces, “seats” and “sides,” and approximately 200 high quality, tight-fitting covers that are removable, washable, and changeable, customers can create numerous permutations of a sectional couch with minimal effort. Customization is further enhanced with our specialty-shaped modular offerings, such as our wedge seat and roll arm side. Our custom features and accessories can be added easily and quickly to a Sactional to meet endless design, style, storage and utility preferences, reflecting our Designed for Life philosophy. Sactionals are built to meet the highest durability and structural standards applicable to fixed couches. Sactionals are comprised of standardized units and we guarantee their compatibility over time, which we believe is a major pillar of their value proposition to the consumer.

● | Sacs. We believe that our Sacs product line is a category leader in oversized beanbags. The Sac product line offers 6 different sizes ranging from 22 pounds to 95 pounds with capacity to seat 3+ people on the larger model Sacs. Filled with Durafoam, a blend of shredded foam, Sacs provide serene comfort and guaranteed durability. Their removable covers are machine washable and may be easily replaced with a wide selection of cover offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accessories. Our accessories complement our Sacs and Sactionals by increasing their adaptability to meet evolving consumer demands and preferences. Our current product line offers Sactional-specific drink holders, Footsac blankets, decorative pillows, fitted seat tables and ottomans in varying styles and finishes and our unique Sactionals Power Hub, providing our customers with the flexibility to customize their furnishings with decorative and practical add-ons to meet evolving style preferences.

Sales Channels



We offer our products through an omni-channel platform that provides a seamless and meaningful experience to our customers online and in-store. Our distribution strategy allows us to reach customers through four distinct, brand-enhancing channels.

● | Ecommerce. Through our ecommerce channel, we believe we are able to significantly enhance the consumer shopping experience for home furnishings, driving deeper brand engagement and loyalty, while also realizing more favorable margins than our showroom locations. We believe our robust technological capabilities position us well to benefit from the growing consumer preference to transact at home and via mobile devices. With furniture especially suited to ecommerce applications, our net sales completed through this channel accounted for 47.1% and 23.9% of total net sales for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Showrooms. We market and sell our products through 108 showrooms at top tier malls, lifestyle centers and street locations in 36 states in the U.S. We carefully select the best small-footprint retail locations in high-end malls and lifestyle centers for our showrooms. Compared to traditional retailers, our showrooms require significantly less square footage because of our need to have only a few in-store sample configurations for display and our ability to stack our inventory for immediate sale. The architecture and layout of these showrooms is designed to communicate our brand personality and key product features. Our goal is to educate first-time customers, creating an environment where people can touch, feel, read, and understand the technology behind our products. We are updating and remodeling many of our showrooms to reflect our new showroom concept, which emphasizes our unique product platform, and will be the standard for future showrooms. Our new showroom concept, introduced in 2016, utilizes technology in more experiential ways to increase traffic and sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other touchpoints. We augment our showrooms with other touchpoint strategies including in store pop-up- shops and shop-in-shops. We utilize in store pop-up-shops to increase the number of locations where customers can experience and purchase our products, a low cost alternative to drive brand awareness, in store sales, and ecommerce sales. These in store pop-up-shops are staffed similarly to our showrooms with associates trained to demonstrate and sell our products and promote our brand. Unlike the in store pop-up-shops which are typically 10-day shows, and pop-up locations, shop-in-shops are designed to be in permanent locations carrying the same digital technology of our showrooms and are also staffed with associates trained to demonstrate and sell our products. Shop-in-shops require less capital expenditure to open a productive space to drive brand awareness and touchpoint opportunities for demonstrating and selling our products. During fiscal year 2021, we operated shop-in-shops at Macy’s and have currently expanded the use of shop-in-shops into Best Buy and online at Best Buy.com. Our Macy’s shop-in-shop test ended January 31, 2021 and we are no longer operating shop-in-shops at Macy’s. We hosted 153 and 756 pop-up-shops at Costco locations during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 5 temporary online pop-ups during fiscal year 2021. We expect to continue hosting temporary online pop-ups on Costco.com and do not currently expect any further contribution from Costco in store pop-up-shops. Other sales which includes pop-up-shop sales and shop-in-shop sales accounted for 7.3% and 12.7% of our total sales for the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers



Our Designed for Life products provide flexibility, upgradeability and sustainability, elements that attract a wide customer base and can change as their life changes. Our customers have different tastes, styles, purchasing goals and budgets when shopping for couches, and our Sactionals platform’s modularity addresses this array of needs.

● | Target Demographics. Based on our internal data, our typical customer is 25 to 45 years in age with an annual household income of over $100,000. We consider this to be an attractive demographic because of its higher than average rates of household formation and furniture purchasing. In 2020, we experienced recent accelerated growth in new customer transactions from our target customers and beyond, demonstrating the expansive relatability and demand of our products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Robust customer lifetime value. The fiscal 2021 cohort had an average first year value of $2,044 per new customer, and this is the highest first year value of all cohorts we have tracked since fiscal 2015 and 51.9% higher than the 3 year benchmark fiscal 2015 cohort whose Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is currently $1,346 which increased from $1,314 in fiscal 2020. We believe this is an outcome of our decision to focus on driving penetration of Sactionals. We calculated our fiscal 2021 cohort CLV by dividing the aggregate gross profits through fiscal 2021 attributed to the fiscal 2021 cohort (approximately $215 million) by the total number of new customers from fiscal 2021 (105,336). In addition, our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) was $434.61 for fiscal 2021. This is an increase from our fiscal 2020 CAC which was $391.71. This increase is attributable to our increase in marketing spend targeted at Sactional customers. We expect our CAC to continue to increase as we continue to target Sactional customers. We expect this increase in CAC to correspond with a continued increase in CLV. Our CLV/CAC ratio for fiscal 2021 was 4.70 compared to 4.68 for fiscal 2020. 

Growth Strategies



To position Lovesac for future growth, in the last several years we have made significant investments in overhead, optimized and integrated our business technologies and processes, and further developed our marketing strategies. In addition, we have refocused our strategy regarding our showrooms, moving to higher end malls and lifestyle centers, to support ecommerce sales, our primary growth channel. We have also moved to fixed versus variable rent structures in many of our lease arrangements and have introduced a new interactive technology driven showroom experience that has resulted in higher traffic levels and conversion.



We are also focused on the following key strategies to drive sales growth:



Continue to Build on Our Brand



Based on our own internal study concluded in April 2017, we estimated that our brand awareness is less than 1% among all consumers nationally. Before 2017, we invested minimally in advertising. Since then, we have aggressively invested in brand building and direct marketing efforts through a robust and diverse marketing mix. Our focus on building the Lovesac and Sactional brands has led to an increase in our new Sactional customer base, which grew by 48.3% in fiscal 2021. Through our ecommerce channel, we believe we are able to significantly enhance the consumer shopping experience, driving deeper brand engagement and loyalty, while also realizing more favorable margins than our showroom locations. We continue to invest into this digital channel to improve user experience, enhancing their research, understanding and confidence in their purchase decision.



Our commitment to sustainability is central to our stated purpose and strategy. Our Designed For Life philosophy calls for products that are built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve with our customers’ lives. Sactionals represent our Designed For Life philosophy in action and customers generally invest in them with a long-term focus. We believe this is a competitive advantage and has helped us establish a unique brand and a successful culture.



New Strategy on Innovation



Innovation and test-and-learn are engrained within our Company, from product to operations to marketing and distribution. From inception, we have focused on developing unique, innovative and proprietary product platforms. We deploy a dual strategy of continuously researching and product invention and designing. We are continuously expanding and introducing new extensions to these platforms to broaden the appeal, grow the addressable market of our product offerings and ultimately continue to grow and evolve with our customers’ needs. We continually evaluate new products to complement our Sactionals and Sac lines and are currently developing accessories for the tech-savvy consumer. 



As we continue to grow our business and add additional showrooms in strategic locations across the United States, we seek the ability to service more customers locally with area-designated representatives who will shift their efforts between our showrooms and customers’ homes. Our concierge operators in the field will be able to assist customers via online chat services from home thereby creating more touchpoints customers in new and existing locations, contributing to our efficient approach to growing our footprint and services to suit the evolving needs of our customers.

Increase Sales and Operating Margins



We seek to increase sales and operating margins through our premium market position and pricing strategy and omni-channel platform, which we believe will require relatively small near term increases in fixed overhead.

● | Premium Market Position and Pricing. Our products are positioned in the premium couch segment of the furniture market. We market as premium products because of our proprietary foam fillings, higher quality materials and unique modularity requiring a distinct level of manufacturing capability. At our price point, we offer a unique value proposition that combines both beautiful aesthetics and utility to our customers that we believe our competitors cannot offer. Additionally, our high-end branding strategy, further enhanced by our unsolicited celebrity endorsements and large social media following, commands premium pricing, as we feel lowering prices may negatively affect the perception of our products. The difference is explained by our platform approach, where once a customer buys their first couch, the cost of expanding and adding to it over time is much less expensive than the traditional method of purchasing another new couch to replace the old one.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Omni-channel Platform. By leveraging our omni-channel platform, we cost-effectively drive traffic to our ecommerce channel, resulting in increased web-based sales and improved operating margins. We continually seek to improve our ecommerce capabilities to drive sales and take advantage of the lower cost of this channel. Our showrooms and other direct marketing efforts work in concert to drive customer conversion in ecommerce. In addition, our shop-in-shops provide a low cost alternative to drive brand awareness and both in-store and ecommerce sales. 

Supply Chain and Sourcing



We manage a global supply chain of highly vetted and qualified, third-party manufacturing partners to produce our products. Our partners operate facilities located in the UnitedStates, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, and India. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities as we believe our partners’ facilities are sufficient to meet our current demand and will be able to meet any additional demand in the future. Additionally, we work closely with our manufacturing partners regarding product quality and manufacturing process efficiency. To mitigate the concentration risk in our supply chain, we have and continue to pursue a higher diversification of manufacturing partners, with both sourcing, tariff, and geographical advantages.
Logistics and Distribution



We are able to efficiently distribute and ship our products to our customers. Due to the unique modularity of our Sactionals products and the shrinkability of our Sacs, we are able to distribute our products through nationwide express couriers and efficiently utilize warehouse space and international shipping routes. We believe our Sactionals are the only product in its category that enjoys this logistical advantage.
Seasonality



We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales. A larger percentage of our sales occur in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which coincides with Cyber Monday (the first Monday after Thanksgiving, when online retailers typically offer holiday discounts), the holiday season and our related promotional and marketing campaigns. Our fiscal 2021 quarters in sequential order equaled 17.0%, 19.3%, 23.3% and 40.4% of total sales respectively.
Intellectual Property



We own 27 U.S. federal trademark registrations, 134 foreign trademark registrations, and a number of U.S. and foreign trademark applications and common law trademark rights. Our registered U.S. trademarks include registrations for the Lovesac®, Lovesoft ®, Sactionals ®, Durafoam ®, SAC ® and Designed For Life® trademarks. Our trademarks, if not renewed, are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2029.



In order to maintain our U.S. trademark registrations, we must continue to use the marks in commerce on the goods and services identified in the registrations and must make required filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at intervals specified by applicable statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in abandonment or cancellation of the registrations.



We have 19 issued U.S. utility patents and 26 issued foreign utility patents, that are scheduled to expire between 2022 and 2037. We have 12 pending U.S. utility patent applications, 36 pending foreign utility patent applications and 2 pending international patent applications. Our Sactional technology patents include our proprietary geometric modular system and segmented bi-coupling technology. We also have multiple patents pending and expect to file patent applications for future innovations. We believe that our patent portfolio, combined with our innovative design approach may deter others from attempting to imitate or replicate our products.



Competition



Our business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Retailers compete based on a variety of factors, including design, quality, price and customer service. Levels of competition and the ability of our competitors to attract customers through competitive pricing or other factors may impact our results of operations. Our competition includes furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online furniture retailers and marketplaces.



We believe our combination of proprietary products, brand strength, loyal customer base, omni-channel approach, technological platform, unique consumer experience, logistical advantages and seasoned management team allow us to compete effectively against and differentiate ourselves from the competition.

COVID-19 Update



While the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in the way in which we operate, including temporarily closing all of our showroom locations and a reduction in workforce, we continued to serve our customers through our online channels. As our products can be easily configured, shopped online and delivered quickly in a touchless way, coupled with consumers’ demand for home related products and solutions, we experienced increased growth during this period. Our net sales increased $87.4 million, or 37.4%, to $320.7 million for the fiscal year ended 2021, compared to $233.4 million for the fiscal year ended 2020 which was driven by internet sales (sales made directly to customers through our ecommerce channel) which increased $95.3 million, or 170.8%, to $151.1 million for the fiscal year ended 2021 compared to $55.8 million for the fiscal year ended 2020 which more than offset the decrease in our showroom net sales of $1.9 million, or 1.3% in the same time periods. New customers increased by 32.9% as of the fiscal year ended 2021 as compared to 22.5% as of the fiscal year ended 2020.  We redeployed 218 full-time field associates, leveraging numerous forms of one-on-one virtual customer interactions such as Facebook live events, Facetime, text messaging and Podium chat systems. We believe that these tactics, which bolster our ongoing direct-to-consumer core competencies, allow us to capitalize on the accelerated growth and demand. Due to the significant growth of our ecommerce platform, we have adapted our systems, technology and supply chain and logistics capabilities to manage the increase in online demand. We plan to continue to develop our digital capabilities and invest in our technological infrastructure.



In an effort to appropriately manage the business in this uncertain environment, we tightly managed our cash outlays. In addition to temporary reduction in compensation of associates and Board of Directors, we also tightly managed inventory purchases, marketing and promotion spend, working capital and capital expenditures. As a result, we had a cash and cash equivalent position of $78.3 million as of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.



Human Capital 



The long-term success of our business depends on attracting, developing and retaining top talent to drive our growth strategy and support our guiding principles. These principles are the foundation of our business and grounded in true sustainability, a singular focus on high quality execution of fewer core products, consideration of all stakeholder perspectives in our decision-making, and championing meaningful relationships through the development of products that bring people together.



Our corporate culture celebrates our associates at online rallies and annual events designed to engage our associates and reward them for exemplary work and embodiment of our values. We support our associates’ professional development through annual training programs on topics relevant to our business, functional areas, or policies and procedures. Our associates participate in quarterly coaching sessions with their managers four times per year where they are evaluated on their performance relative to certain key performance indicators and alignment with our values and given actionable feedback.  We engage our associates on many levels to share learnings, educate, and foster community and connection. 



Our talent acquisition strategy is to attract top talent and become a sought-after U.S. employer focused on our Designed For Life philosophy and a culture of diversity, equality and inclusivity.  We have initiated this strategy by expanding the areas from which source talent and offering flexible remote working opportunities for eligible associates. We will continue to build on this strategy, working in parallel with our evolving future work strategy.  We also offer a robust and immersive onboarding plan to create a strong foundation for our new associates and timely, effective integration.



Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in fiscal 2021 a majority of our workforce began, and in most cases continue, to work remotely. To support our headquarters-based associates, we took measures to ensure our associates had the technology to support remote work and are redefining our future working environment to offer flexible working solutions. For associates supporting our showrooms, we implemented specific protocols to ensure the safety of our associates and our customers. 



As of January 31, 2021, we had 369 full-time associates and 409 part-time associates, and we contracted with 7 independent contractors. Our workforce was 58% female, and women hold 60% of the available leadership roles within the Company.



All associates and contractors are subject to contractual agreements that specify, among other things, requirements for confidentiality, ownership of newly developed intellectual property and restrictions on working for competitors as well as other matters.

Diversity, Equality and Inclusion



In fiscal 2021, we prioritized developing a strategic diversity, equality and inclusion plan to ensure a diverse workforce composition, operating in an inclusive and transparent workplace culture, to leverage all of our talents. We engaged with partners to guide our diversity, equality and inclusion strategy, and elicited feedback from our associates on factors affecting diverse individuals and communities. We also established a steering committee of senior leaders and a Diversity and Inclusion Council of associates to drive our program’s objectives. We have expanded our diversity recruiting practices, deployed training programs to increase awareness of diversity, equality and inclusion issues, and are developing tools to drive accountability toward achieving the Company’s goals.
Product Development



Lovesac designs and sells non-seasonally driven, Designed For Life products, that are focused on driving incremental value for our customer.  The process leverages numerous inputs to shape our product roadmap, sequencing of product launches, and prioritization of product projects.  A few examples of these sources of information are consumer insights generated by research commissioned by Lovesac, patterning our category and key competitors, and product opportunities developed to address customer satisfaction.  All products that we bring to market must adhere to our Designed For Life design philosophy which calls for products that are built to last a lifetime and designed to evolve as life changes. This ensures that our products not only leverage responsible inputs when possible, but also create a sustainable product that is built to last and designed to evolve.
Government Regulation



We are subject to numerous U.S. and international trade laws and regulations, and U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations covering a variety of subject matters, many of which are evolving. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data protection and personal information, intellectual property, product liability, ecommerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business and/or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
