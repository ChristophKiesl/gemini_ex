History of the Company
 
The Company was initially organized in Utah in 1916 under a name later changed to Onasco Companies, Inc.  In 1995, the Company changed its name from Onasco Companies, Inc. by merging into Tengasco, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, formed by the Company solely for that purpose.  On June 11, 2011, the stockholders of the Company approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger which provided for the merger of the Company into a wholly owned subsidiary formed in Delaware for the purpose of changing the Company’s state of incorporation from Tennessee to Delaware resulting in the Company becoming a Delaware corporation.

On February 26, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Riley Exploration Permian, Inc., a Delaware corporation (f/k/a Tengasco, Inc. (“Tengasco”)), consummated the previously announced merger pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”), dated as of October 21, 2020, by and among Tengasco, Antman Sub, LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Tengasco (“Merger Sub”), and Riley Exploration – Permian, LLC (“REP, LLC”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 20, 2021, by and among Tengasco, Merger Sub and Riley. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between the Registrant and Riley was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Riley, with Riley surviving as the surviving company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Merger Transaction”). On the Closing Date, the Registrant changed its name from Tengasco, Inc. to Riley Exploration Permian, Inc. Our organizational structure includes wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries through which our operations are conducted, including without limitation, Riley Exploration – Permian, LLC and Riley Permian Operating Company, LLC.
 
The shares of the Company began trading under the ticker symbol REPX on the NYSE American on March 1, 2021.
 
OVERVIEW
    The Company is in the business of exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s only areas of operations were in Kansas.  As part of the merger detailed below, the Company’s operations were significantly expanded to the Permian Basin in Texas.  Since the closing of the merger, the Company has pursued potential opportunities in Texas, as well as strategic divestitures of non-core assets in Kansas.  As part of this process, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the legacy Kansas assets. The closing of this divestiture remains subject to various conditions to closing and there can be no assurance that the sale will be completed.  (See Note 15. Subsequent Events included in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Tengasco Pipeline Corporation (“TPC”) owned and operated a pipeline which it constructed to transport natural gas from the Company’s Swan Creek Field to customers in Kingsport, Tennessee.  The Company sold all its pipeline assets on August 16, 2013.
 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Manufactured Methane Corporation (“MMC”) operated treatment and delivery facilities in Church Hill, Tennessee for the extraction of methane gas from a landfill for eventual sale as natural gas or for the generation of electricity.  The Company sold all its methane facility assets, except the applicable U.S. patent, on January 26, 2018.
 
In connection with the Merger Transaction, the Company acquired the assets of REP, LLC. REP, LLC is an oil and gas exploration and production company with acreage is primarily located on large contiguous blocks in Yoakum County, Texas and Lea, Roosevelt and Chaves Counties in New Mexico; and the offset legacy assets are located in the Permian Basin San Andres fields, which include the Wasson and Brahaney Fields. Unless otherwise noted, the financial and operational data, such as reserves, production, wells and acreage, provided in this document exclude amounts related to REP, LLC’s assets due to the Merger Transaction closing subsequent to December 31, 2020.
 
General
    1. The Kansas Properties
 
The Company’s operated properties in Kansas are located in central Kansas and as of December 31, 2020 included 153 producing oil wells, 19 shut-in wells, 6 temporarily abandoned wells, and 36 active disposal wells (the “Kansas Properties”).  The Company has onsite production management and field personnel working out of the Hays, Kansas office.
 
The leases for the Kansas Properties typically provide for a landowner royalty of 12.5%.  Some wells are subject to an overriding royalty interest from approximately 0.5% to 15%.  The Company maintains a 100% working interest in most of its wells in Kansas.

During 2020, the Company did not participate in drilling any wells.  However, the Company did sell its interest in six wells during 2020.  By using 3-D seismic evaluation on the Company’s existing leases, the Company has historically added proven direct offset locations.
 
A.  Kansas Production
 
The Company’s gross operated oil production in Kansas decreased by 12.2 MBbl from 110.9 MBbl in 2019 to 98.7 MBbl in 2020.  This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes on the Veverka D lease as a result of expected declines from higher volumes realized immediately after the polymer work performed in June 2018 and natural declines on various other properties.
B.  Kansas Ten Well Drilling Program
 
On September 17, 2007, the Company entered into a ten well drilling program with Hoactzin Partners, L.P. (“Hoactzin”), consisting of wells to be drilled on the Company’s Kansas Properties (the “Program”). Peter E. Salas, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is the controlling person of Hoactzin and of Dolphin Offshore Partners, L.P., the Company’s largest shareholder.  During the 4th quarter of 2018, the Company acquired Hoactzin’s interest in the Program wells for $131,290.
 
2.  Tennessee Properties
 
A.  Manufactured Methane Facilities
 
On October 24, 2006, the Company signed a twenty-year Landfill Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with predecessors in interest of Republic Services, Inc. (“Republic”). The Company assigned its interest in the Agreement to MMC.  The Agreement provided that MMC would purchase the entire naturally produced gas stream being collected at the Carter Valley municipal solid waste landfill owned and operated by Republic in Church Hill, Tennessee.  The Company installed a proprietary combination of advanced gas treatment technology to extract the methane component of the purchased gas stream.  (the “Methane Project”).
 
MMC declared startup of commercial operations of the Methane Project on April 1, 2009.  The total cost for the Methane Project through startup, including pipeline construction, was approximately $4.5 million.
 
In April 2011, MMC purchased from Parkway Services Group of Lafayette, Louisiana a Caterpillar genset which was delivered in late 2011 and installed at the plant site for generation of electricity.  Total cost of the generator including installation and interconnection with the power grid was approximately $1.1 million.
 
On January 25, 2012, MMC commenced sales of electricity generated at the Carter Valley site.  The electricity generated was sold under a twenty-year firm price contract with Holston Electric Cooperative, Inc., the local distributor, and Tennessee Valley Authority (“TVA”) through TVA’s Generation Partners program.  That program accepted generated renewable power up to 999KW; MMC’s generation equipment is rated at 974 KW to maximize revenues under the favorable electricity pricing under the Generation Partners program.  The price provision under this contract paid MMC the current retail price charged monthly to small commercial customers by Holston Electric Cooperative, plus a “green” premium of 3 cents per kilowatt hour (KWH) or approximately $.129 per KWH.  Beginning in January 2022 the price paid for electricity will no longer include the three-cent “green” premium component.  A one-eighth royalty on electricity revenues has been paid to the landfill owner.
 
On September 17, 2007, Hoactzin was conveyed a 75% net profits interest in the Methane Project.  Since the start of 2014, there have been no methane gas sales or revenues and consequently no net profits attributable to Hoactzin’s net profits interest.
 
On January 26, 2018, the Company closed a sale to Tennessee Renewable Group LLC for all of the Company’s Manufactured Methane assets, except for the applicable U.S. patent, for $2.65 million.  Hoactzin expressly released all claims in future periods against both the Company and Tennessee Renewable Group LLC based on the September 17, 2007 net profits agreement described immediately above.

3.  Other Areas of Development
 
Although focused on development of its current Kansas holdings, the Company will continue to review potential transactions involving producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Kansas as well as acquisition and drilling opportunities in other states including development opportunities on our newly acquired properties in Texas and New Mexico.
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company is subject to numerous state and federal regulations, environmental and otherwise, that may have a substantial negative effect on its ability to operate at a profit.  For a discussion of the risks involved as a result of such regulations, see, “Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Business” hereinafter in this section, and “The Company has Significant Costs to Conform to Government Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry” and “The Company has Significant Costs Related to Environmental Matters” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
The principal markets for the Company’s crude oil are local refining companies.  At present, crude oil produced by the Company in Kansas is sold at or near the wells to Coffeyville Resources (“Coffeyville”) in Kansas City, Kansas and to CHS McPherson Refinery (“CHS”) in McPherson, Kansas.  Both Coffeyville and CHS are solely responsible for transportation to their refineries of the oil they purchase.  The Company may sell some or all of its production to one or more additional refineries in order to maximize revenues as oil prices offered by the refineries fluctuate from time to time.
Drilling Equipment
 
The Company does not own a drilling rig or any related drilling equipment.  The Company obtains drilling services as required from time to time from various drilling contractors.
Distribution Methods of Products or Services
 
Crude oil is normally delivered to refineries in Kansas by tank truck.
 
Competitive Business Conditions, Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
 
The Company’s contemplated oil and gas exploration activities in the State of Kansas or other states will be undertaken in a highly competitive and speculative business atmosphere.  In seeking any other suitable oil and gas properties for acquisition, the Company will be competing with a number of other companies, including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources.  As of December 31, 2020, management did not believe that the Company’s competitive position in the oil and gas industry was significant as the Company existed at that time.
 
There are numerous producers in the area of the Kansas Properties.  Some of these companies are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources.  These companies are in competition with the Company for lease positions in the known producing areas in which the Company currently operates, as well as other potential areas of interest.
 
Although management does not foresee any difficulties in procuring contracted drilling rigs, several factors, including increased competition in the area, may limit the availability of drilling rigs, rig operators and related personnel and/or equipment in the future. Such limitations would have a natural adverse impact on the profitability of the Company’s operations.
 
The Company anticipates no difficulty in procuring well drilling permits in any state.  The Company generally does not apply for a permit until it is actually ready to commence drilling operations.
 
The prices of the Company’s products are controlled by the world oil market.  Thus, competitive pricing behaviors are considered unlikely; however, competition in the oil and gas exploration industry exists in the form of competition to acquire the most promising acreage blocks and obtaining the most favorable process for transporting the product.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Excluding the development of oil and gas reserves and the production of oil and gas, the Company’s operations are not dependent on the acquisition of any raw materials.
 
 9
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
At present, crude oil from the Kansas Properties is being purchased at the well and trucked by Coffeyville and CHS, which are responsible for transportation of the crude oil purchased.  The Company may sell some or all of its production to one or more additional refineries in order to maximize revenues as oil prices offered by the refineries fluctuate from time to time.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, Including Duration
 
On October 19, 2010, the Company’s subsidiary MMC was granted United States Patent No. 7,815,713 for Landfill Gas Purification Method and System, pursuant to application filed January 10, 2007.  The patent term is for twenty years from filing date plus adjustment period of 595 days due to the length of the review process resulting in grant of the patent.  The patent is for the process designed and utilized by MMC at the Carter Valley landfill facility.  The patent may result in a competitive advantage to MMC in seeking new projects, and in the receipt of licensing fees for other projects that may be using or wish to use the process in the future.  However, the limited number of high Btu projects currently existing and operated by others, the variety of processes available for use in high Btu projects, and the effects of current gas markets and decreasing or inapplicable green energy incentives for such projects in combination cause the materiality of any licensing opportunity presented by the patent to be difficult to determine or estimate, and thus the licensing fees from the patent, if any are received, may not be material to the Company’s overall results of operations.
Need For Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
None of the principal products offered by the Company require governmental approval, although permits are required for drilling oil or gas wells.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Business
 
Exploration and production activities relating to oil and gas leases are subject to numerous environmental laws, rules and regulations.  The Federal Clean Water Act requires the Company to construct a fresh water containment barrier between the surface of each drilling site and the underlying water table.  This involves the insertion of steel casing into each well, with cement on the outside of the casing.  The Company has fully complied with this environmental regulation.
 
As part of the Company’s purchase of the Kansas Properties, the Company acquired a statewide permit to drill in Kansas.  Applications under such permit are applied for and issued within one to two weeks prior to drilling.  At the present time, the State of Kansas does not require the posting of a bond either for permitting or to ensure that the Company’s wells are properly plugged when abandoned.  All of the wells in the Kansas Properties have all permits required and the Company believes that it is in compliance with the laws of the State of Kansas.
 
The Company’s exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels.  The Company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations.  Further, the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs. These regulations affect the Company’s operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons it may produce and sell.  Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of royalty payments.  The Company’s operations are also subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.  For example, in May 2014 the Company become subject to regulations under the federal Endangered Species Act relating to the protection of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species.  To avoid stringent penalties for violation of those regulations, the Company entered into a state-operated voluntary agreement, which allowed the Company to avoid those penalties, provided certain protective methods are followed in drilling operations and remediation fees are paid by the Company for any wells determined to be likely to interfere with the habitat of the threatened species.  These fees may increase the Company’s costs to drill in Kansas by approximately $40,000 per well.  The Company owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and analogous state laws.  Under such laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination.
 
Laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and, may in some cases, impose “strict liability” for environmental damage.  Strict liability means that the Company may be held liable for damage without regard to whether it was negligent or otherwise at fault.  Environmental laws and regulations may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
 
 10
 
While management believes that the Company’s operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies, the Company’s ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls.  The Company’s current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations may be susceptible, on a going forward basis, to increased scrutiny, greater complexity resulting in increased costs or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations.
 
The Company maintains an Environmental Response Policy and Emergency Action Response Policy Program.  A plan was adopted which provides for the erection of signs at each well containing telephone numbers of the Company’s office.  A list is maintained at the Company’s office and at the home of key personnel listing phone numbers for fire, police, emergency services and Company employees who will be needed to deal with emergencies.
 
The foregoing is only a brief summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules, and regulations to which the Company’s business operations are subject, and there are many others, the effects of which could have an adverse impact on the Company.  Future legislation in this area will be enacted and revisions will be made in current laws.  No assurance can be given as to the effect these present and future laws, rules, and regulations will have on the Company’s current and future operations.
