BUSINESS OVERVIEW

For over 30 years, Adobe’s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments interact. Across these markets, we help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow, and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anywhere, anytime.
While we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services, and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic growth areas:
Digital Media—providing tools, services and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers and digital media professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have delivered for over 25 years, and we have evolved our business model rapidly to provide these customers with a more complete and integrated workflow across the variety of new devices, formats and business models that continue to emerge.
Digital Marketing—providing solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital advertising and marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, 
 3

merchandisers, web analysts, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and sales and support executives. We process over 90 trillion data transactions a year via our SaaS products, providing our customers with analytics, social, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management and video solutions. This complements our digital media franchise, bringing together the art of creating and managing content with the science of measuring and optimizing it, enabling our customers to achieve their optimal business outcomes.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories, where our mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these two areas of Adobe’s business, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue investing in engaging their constituents digitally.
SEGMENTS
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing. These segments provide Adobe’s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Print and Publishing business in a third segment that contains some of our mature products and solutions.
This overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2017 and beyond for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment information.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OVERVIEW
Digital Media
Digital Media Opportunity
Recent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Due to increases in mobile computing and bandwidth, rich media consumed in digital environments and the rise of online social communities, the demand for digital media solutions to create engaging online experiences is higher than ever. Adobe is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity by delivering rapid innovation to increase our customer reach, deepen engagement with communities and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed on a subscription basis.
The flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud—a subscription service that allows members to use Adobe’s creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktops, web and mobile devices. Creative Cloud members can download and access the latest versions of our creative products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Adobe InDesign and many more creative applications. They can also use Creative Cloud mobile apps and integrated cloud-delivered services on their connected devices such as smartphones and mobile devices to augment their creative process wherever they go. In addition, members can access a growing marketplace of digital content through Adobe Stock, a leading online marketplace for photos, graphics and videos, as well as fonts from the Adobe Typekit marketplace. Through Creative Cloud, members can access online services to sync, store, and share files; showcase and discover work on Behance, the largest online community of creative professionals; publish and deliver digital content via app stores; develop mobile apps; and design and manage websites. Adobe is redefining the creative process with Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything they need to create, collaborate and deliver engaging digital content. A core part of Creative Cloud is Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning capabilities to tackle today’s complex creative experience challenges. 
Creative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals including graphic designers, production artists, web designers and developers, experience and user interface designers, videographers, motion graphic artists, prepress professionals, video game developers, mobile application developers, students and administrators. They rely on our solutions for publishing, web design and development, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and document creation and collaboration. End users of our creative tools work in businesses ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, small and medium-sized businesses and individual freelancers. Moreover, our creative solutions are used 
 4

to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers also use our solutions to create and deliver creative content.
Our Digital Media business offers many of the products included in Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including cloud-enabled subscriptions to the Creative Cloud version of certain point products. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including our hobbyist products such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements, Adobe Typekit and mobile apps such as Adobe Photoshop Mix, Adobe Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Photoshop Fix, Adobe Capture CC, and Adobe Spark that run on tablets and mobile devices. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under “Principal Products and Services.”
Adobe’s Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of solutions, the Adobe Acrobat Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services. For over twenty years, Adobe Acrobat has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free Adobe Acrobat Reader. Acrobat provides essential electronic document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide range of tasks ranging from simple publications and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solutions. Users can take advantage of electronic document signing with Adobe Sign and manage, track and control documents through Adobe Send & Track.
Digital Media Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of tools and services that allow individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish and monetize their content anywhere.
We expect to continue driving new user adoption of our creative business over the next several years outside of our core creative professional target market because of the attractive monthly subscription pricing for Creative Cloud combined with the strong brand of our creative solutions and the broad value proposition provided by Creative Cloud. The subscription model results in a ratably reported revenue stream that is recurring and highly predictable. 
We are focused on migrating existing users from older versions to current versions of our offerings, and new customer adoption. Aspects of this strategy include: focusing future innovation by our engineering teams on delivering cloud-based functionality, such as Creative Cloud Libraries and Adobe CreativeSync, to enable our customers to use our creative tools and services across a variety of devices in ways that are not possible with previous desktop versions; integrating Creative Cloud with our Adobe Stock online marketplace offerings; increasing the value of Creative Cloud by delivering frequent updates and enhancements to subscribers to address their content creation challenges; using promotions to attract customers to the offering; expanding our go-to-market reach through channel partners to acquire new customers; and utilizing Creative Cloud for teams and Creative Cloud for enterprise offerings to drive broad adoption with customers who license our offerings in volume.
As part of our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize our digital marketing solutions to drive customer awareness of our creative products and increase sales of our products through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.
In our Document Cloud business, although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are tens of millions of users who still need the capabilities provided by Acrobat. We plan to continue to market the benefits of our Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-based pricing, to individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world and increase our seat penetration in these markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets, while simultaneously enhancing and building out the delivery of cloud-based document services to our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader users. We intend to continue promoting the capabilities of our cloud-based document solutions to millions of Acrobat users and hundreds of millions of Adobe Acrobat Reader users. Our Adobe Sign services provide a green alternative to costly paper-based solutions, and are an easier way for customers to manage their contract workflows. We believe that by growing the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market and continuing to add new capabilities to our Adobe Sign offering, we can help our customers migrate away from paper-based express mailing and adopt our solution, growing our revenue with this business in the process.

Digital Marketing
Digital Marketing Opportunity
Consumers today increasingly demand personalized content and experiences in their online interactions, across multiple channels and devices. As a result, any business or entity with an online presence must figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impacts success. Delivering the best experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Marketing executives are increasingly demanding solutions that optimize their consumers’ experiences and deliver the greatest return on their marketing spend so they can demonstrate the success of their programs using objective metrics.
We believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. Chief Marketing Officers, digital marketers, advertisers and publishers are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and development budgets toward digital media. Many industry analysts predict more advertising dollars will be spent in digital than in traditional media in the future. As marketers make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as customers look for vendors to help them navigate this transition. However, marketing in a digital world is not simply about executing campaigns in each digital channel. Marketers, and entire enterprises, also need to ensure they deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers across both digital and traditional channels and in areas such as sales, support, and product interactions where consumers expect experiences to be consistent and personalized.
Our Digital Marketing business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions for data and analytics, advertising, personalization, and content delivery. Our solutions focused on these categories include features for web and mobile analytics, social marketing, targeting, advertising and media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, advertising and real-time bidding technology, premium video delivery and monetization. We deliver these capabilities through our Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal business performance. With its broad set of solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime, as well as real-time dashboards and a collaborative interface, customers of Adobe Marketing Cloud are able to combine data, insights and digital content to deliver a personalized brand experience to their consumers. The artificial intelligence and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances Adobe Marketing Cloud.  By building on existing features such as anomaly detection in Adobe Analytics and predictive outcome capabilities with solutions such as Adobe Campaign, we believe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.
In addition to Chief Marketing Officers and digital experience professionals, users of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions include marketing professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers, marketing research analysts and customer analytics teams. Customers also include web content editors, web analysts, web marketing managers, email developers and mobile apps developers. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
Our Digital Marketing segment also contains two legacy enterprise software offerings: our Adobe Connect web conferencing platform and Adobe LiveCycle, an enterprise document and forms platform. Since fiscal 2012, the focus of marketing and licensing these products has been to financial services and government markets, driven by a subset of our enterprise sales force. We have also been focused on migrating some legacy LiveCycle customers to an updated offering with similar capabilities based on our Adobe Experience Manager solution.
Digital Marketing Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of marketing solutions and a standard for the way digital advertising and marketing is created, measured, managed, executed and optimized.
We believe that our success will be driven by focusing our efforts on making Adobe Marketing Cloud the most comprehensive and integrated marketing solution available. We focus on four key market opportunities: Personalization, Content, Advertising, and Data & Analytics. Our focus on these opportunities utilizes nine key solutions—Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Primetime and the TubeMogul advertising platform. 
 6

These solutions provide marketers with key capabilities, such as the ability to:

• | Combine data across the Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions and third-party data sources, such as customer relationship management, point of sale, e-commerce, advertising, outlets, support systems, and surveys, to create a single view of the consumer;


• | Deliver consistent personalized customer experiences across channels and on any device;


• | Use predictive analytics to enable marketers to utilize past marketing program data and success to predict and drive their future success with digital marketing programs;


• | Access all Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions from one centralized platform and visualize, socialize, and collaborate across teams with the interface;


• | Interact with creatives through integration with Creative Cloud, enabling content creators and marketers to collaborate and communicate in real time within a cloud-based platform;


• | Accurately forecast and continually optimize their mix of campaigns across digital media;


• | Provide robust cross-channel campaign orchestration capabilities utilizing real-time insights, rich customer data and a sophisticated automation and execution platform;


• | Manage, publish, track, and monetize social programs;


• | Store, assemble, and distribute digital assets to deliver high-quality brand, campaign, and content experiences;


• | Build unique audience profiles, allowing marketers to identify their most valuable segments and use them across digital channels;


• | Easily add, alter, and deploy marketing tags on websites, resulting in consistent page performance and accurate data collection; and


• | Integrate with a robust network of partners, covering the expansive digital marketing ecosystem.

To drive growth of Adobe Marketing Cloud, we also intend to streamline how customers learn about, acquire and deploy Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. We believe we can accelerate the growth of our business by continuing to build out more direct sales capacity, as well as continuing to enable a rich ecosystem of agencies and SIs who sell, implement and service our solutions. We believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Marketing segment in fiscal 2017 and beyond.
Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry.
We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output devices. In fiscal 2016, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and license in our Print and Publishing business.

One of these new services, Adobe Stock, is an online marketplace with over 60 million curated photos, graphics, videos, templates and 3D assets that is deeply integrated with Creative Cloud apps.

With the demands of shorter production schedules and high-resolution digital media formats, real-time performance is crucial to videographers.

Other Products and Solutions
We also offer a broad range of other enterprise and digital media products and solutions. Information about other products not referenced here can be found on our corporate website, www.adobe.com, under the “Products” tab available in the “Menu.”
COMPETITION
The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate and respond to emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes.
Digital Media
No single company has offerings identical to our Creative Cloud products and services, but we face collective competition from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competitors include offerings from companies such as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Corel, Microsoft, Quark, Getty Images, Shutterstock and others, as well as from many lower-end offerings available on touch-enabled devices via app stores, and from various open source initiatives. We believe our greatest advantage in this space is the scope of our integrated solutions, which work together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative Cloud we also compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality, ease of use, product reliability, value and performance characteristics.

Professional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand awareness and price sensitivity. Competition in this space is also emerging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly evolving and highly volatile. In this area we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.
The needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other new devices. Our imaging and video offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere Pro, face competition from established and emerging companies offering similar products.
New image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional tools are also emerging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense competition, including customer price sensitivity, competitor brand awareness and competitor strength in OEM bundling and retail distribution. We face direct and indirect competition in the consumer digital imaging space from a number of companies that market software that competes with ours.
The stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily operates today with the Adobe Stock offering and Fotolia.com. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images and a number of smaller companies. Adobe Stock’s deep product integration with Creative Cloud and superior reach and relationships with creative professionals around the world differentiate our offerings.
In addition, we face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling, for free, their own digital imaging software, or those of our competitors. Similarly, we face potential competition from operating system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software. Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers in particular will be encouraged to use the image and video editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.
Competition is also emerging with imaging and video applications on smartphone and tablet platforms. Competitors are extending their products and feature sets to platforms such as Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and other smartphone and tablet devices. Similarly, new cloud-based offerings continue to emerge which offer image editing and video-editing capabilities, as well as social and sharing features.
The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web. To address these competitive threats, we are working to ensure our Adobe Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emerging opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security.
As e-signatures are quickly becoming a core element of digital documents, competitors to Adobe Sign such as DocuSign and Citrix have been jumping in to take advantage of the growing space. We face strong competition from these and other companies in this space.

Digital Marketing
The markets in which our Digital Marketing business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense competition. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Marketo, Oracle, salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Yahoo!, Verizon, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. Additionally, new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to customers, generally through a web browser, while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. In addition, we compete at times with our customers’ or potential customers’ internally developed applications. Of the competitors listed above, no single company has products identical to our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud competes in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; audience management; advertising and real-time bidding technology; video delivery and monetization; web experience management and others.
Many of the companies with which we compete offer a variety of products or services and as a result could also bundle their products or services, which may result in these companies effectively selling their products or services at or below market prices for individual products. In addition, large software, internet and database management companies have expanded their offerings in the digital marketing area, either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-cost alternatives based on many of these competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.
Creative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital marketing technology to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital marketing capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked closely with marketing and creative customers for over thirty years. We also believe we have leadership in this space, with current customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization and social capabilities in our Adobe Marketing Cloud. Most importantly, we provide a vision for our digital marketing customers as we engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their use of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to how they manage, deliver, measure and monetize their content with our Adobe Marketing Cloud.
Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale electronic and web publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies as well as lower-end desktop publishing products. Depending on the product line, competition is based on a number of factors, including: the quality and features of products, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of customization and integration with other publishing system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among users, the widespread adoption of our products among printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interfaces.
In printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability, price, support and engineering development assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency, OEM customer relationships and our intellectual property portfolio.

OPERATIONS
Marketing and Sales
We market and license our products directly using our sales force and through our own website at www.adobe.com. We also market and distribute our products through sales channels, which include distributors, retailers, software developers, SIs, ISVs and VARs, as well as through OEM and hardware bundle customers. 
We support our end users through local field offices and our worldwide distribution network, which includes locations in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Moldova, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.
We sell the majority of our products through a software subscription model where our customers purchase access to a product for a specific period of time during which they always have rights to use the most recent version of that product. We also license perpetual versions of our software with maintenance and support, which includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, support, updates and enhancements.
For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no customers that represented at least 10% of net revenue. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, no single customer was responsible for over 10% of our trade receivables. 
Order Fulfillment Distribution
Our evolution to a services and subscription-based business model has decreased the need to produce and distribute physical products. We still produce packaged products for a small subset of our business, but that percentage is declining as the digital delivery of our services and subscriptions continues to grow.
 In regard to physical products that we distribute, the procurement of the various components of packaged products, including DVDs and printed materials, and the assembly of packages for retail and other applications are controlled by our product delivery operations organization. We outsource our procurement, production, inventory and fulfillment activities to third parties in the United States, Germany and Singapore.
To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our products or in the replication of DVDs, printing and assembly of components.
Services and Support
We provide expert consulting, customer success management, technical support, and learning services across all our customer segments, including enterprises, small and medium businesses, creative professionals, and consumers. With a focus on ensuring sustained customer success and realized value, this comprehensive portfolio of services is designed to help customers and partners maximize the return on their investments in our cloud solutions and licensed products. Our service and support revenue consists primarily of consulting fees, software maintenance, technical support fees and training fees.
Consulting Services
We have a global professional services team dedicated to designing and implementing solutions for our largest customers. Our professional services team uses a comprehensive, customer-focused methodology that has been refined over years of capturing and analyzing best practices from numerous customer engagements across a diverse mix of solutions, industries, and customer segments. Increasingly, our customers seek to integrate across Adobe’s products and cloud solutions, and engage our professional services teams to share their expertise in leading customers’ digital strategies and multi-solution integrations. Using our methodology, our professional services teams are able to accelerate customers’ time to value, and maximize the return customers earn on their investment in Adobe solutions.
A key component of Adobe’s strategy is developing a large partner ecosystem to expand the reach and breadth of Adobe solutions in the global marketplace. In order to assist partners in building their respective digital practices, Adobe Global Services provides a comprehensive set of deliverables through Adobe’s Solution Partner Program. The breadth of services described in the program provides system integrators (SIs), digital / media agencies, and regional partners the tools required to develop core capabilities for positioning and building with Adobe technology, as well as implementing and running customer platforms. We believe that through these programmatic services and support, our joint customers benefit greatly by the combination of Adobe technology and the deep customer context that our global partners represent.

Customer Success Account Management
For our largest Digital Marketing and Digital Media customers, Adobe Global Services provides post-sales Customer Success Managers, who work individually with customers on an ongoing basis to understand their current and future business needs, promote faster solution adoption, and align solution capabilities to customers’ business objectives to maximize the return on their investment in Adobe’s solutions. We engage customers to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge, and proven success strategies based on our extensive engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customer-focused outcomes, notably ongoing customer retention.
Technical Support
Adobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription entitlement, and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide:

• | technical support on the products they have purchased from Adobe;


• | “how to” help in using our products; and


• | product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is typically one to three years.

We provide product support through a global support organization that includes several regional and global support centers, supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone, chat, web, social media, and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.
As registered owners of the current version of an Adobe desktop product, consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support on certain matters, to support easy adoption of their products. Support for some products and in some countries may vary. For enterprise customers with greater support needs, we offer personalized service options through Premium Services options, delivered by technical account managers who can also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business critical deployments.
Lastly, we also offer delivery assurance, technical support, and enablement services to partners and developer organizations. Through the Adobe Partner Connection Program, we provide developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.
Digital Learning Services
Adobe Global Services offers a comprehensive portfolio of learning and enablement services to assist our customer and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Marketing, Digital Media and other legacy products and solutions. Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on www.training.adobe.com. Adobe Digital Learning Services also has an extensive portfolio of fee-based learning programs including a wide range of traditional classroom, virtual, and on-demand training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals and partners across the globe.
These core offerings are complemented by our custom learning services, which support our largest enterprise customers and their unique requirements. Solution-specific skills assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams and tailor their learning priorities accordingly. Finally, aligned with our cloud strategy, we have introduced a new learning subscription service that enables customers to access both business and technical Digital Marketing training over a 12-month period, which is a scalable approach to supporting long-term learning.
Investments
From time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for strategic purposes as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies, as well as expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

As the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new solutions. We develop our software internally as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owned the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.
During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, our research and development expenses were $976.0 million, $862.7 million and $844.4 million, respectively.
PRODUCT PROTECTION
We regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe our patents have significant value, no single patent is material to us or to any of our reporting segments. We protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets and make source code available to third parties only under limited circumstances and subject to security and confidentiality constraints. From time to time, we secure rights to third-party intellectual property if beneficial to our business.
Our products are generally licensed to end users under one of the following two methods:

(1) | We offer products on a “right to use” basis pursuant to a license agreement that restricts the use of the products to a designated number of devices, users or both, and other restrictions. We also rely on copyright laws and on “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses that are not physically signed by the end user. Copyright protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries and the enforceability of “shrink wrap” and electronic licenses has not been conclusively determined in all jurisdictions.


(2) | We offer products under a SaaS or on-demand model, where hosted software is provided on demand to customers, generally through a web browser. The use of these products is governed by either the online terms of use or an enterprise licensing agreement associated with the product.

Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry. This problem is particularly acute in international markets. We conduct piracy conversion and prevention programs directly and through certain external software associations. In addition, we have activation technology in certain products to guard against illegal use and will continue to do so in certain future products.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 2, 2016, we employed 15,706 people. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good.
