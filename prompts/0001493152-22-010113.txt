ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND- MERGER AND SPIN-OFF
 
Amergent Hospitality Group Inc. was incorporated on February 18, 2020 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chanticleer Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Chanticleer”), for the purpose of conducting the business of Chanticleer and its subsidiaries after completion of the spin-off of all the shares of Amergent to the shareholders of Chanticleer.
 
In connection with and prior to its merger (“Merger”) with Sonnet BioTherapeutics Holdings Inc., a New Jersey Corporation (“Sonnet”), Chanticleer contributed and transferred to Amergent, a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chanticleer, all of Chanticleer’s business, operations, assets and liabilities, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement between Chanticleer and Amergent dated March 31, 2020.
 
All of Chanticleer’s then current restaurant business operations were contributed to Amergent and the stockholders of record received the same pro-rata ownership in Amergent as in Chanticleer.
 
As a result of the Spin-Off, Amergent emerged as successor to the business, operations, assets and liabilities of pre-merger Chanticleer. Additionally, Amergent’s shareholder base and their holdings (on a pro-rata basis) are identical to that of pre-merger Chanticleer.
 
GOING CONCERN QUALIFICATION
 
Our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $2.3 million, of which $1.7 million was restricted cash, our working capital deficiency was $12.5 million and we had significant near-term commitments and contractual obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund its operations for the next 12 months. 
 
To alleviate these conditions, management is evaluating various funding alternatives and may seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, mezzanine or debt securities, through arrangements with strategic partners or through obtaining credit from financial institutions. As we seek additional sources of financing, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the debt and equity capital markets is subject to several factors, including market and economic conditions, our performance and investor sentiment with respect to us and our industry.
 
BUSINESS
 
Amergent is in the business of owning, operating and franchising fast casual dining concepts.
 
We operate and franchise a system-wide total of 42 fast casual restaurants of which 29 are company-owned (an additional location opened January 4, 2022) and included in our consolidated and combined financial statements, and 13 are owned and operated by franchisees under franchise agreements.

American Burger Company (“ABC”) is a fast-casual dining chain consisting of 2 locations in North Carolina and New York, known for its diverse menu featuring fresh salads, customized burgers, milk shakes, sandwiches, and beer and wine.
 
BGR: The Burger Joint (“BGR”) was acquired in March 2015 and currently consists of 7 company-owned locations in the United States and 7 franchisee-operated locations in the United States. The former locations in the Middle East are closed.
 
Little Big Burger (“LBB”) was acquired in September 2015 and currently consists of 16 company-owned locations in the Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and Charlotte, North Carolina areas. One location was temporarily closed at December 31, 2021 due to lack of available employees. The newest location at the University of Oregon was leased in August 2021 and became operational in December 2021. Of the company-owned restaurants, 8 of those locations are operated under partnership agreements with investors we have determined we are the primary beneficiary as we control the management and operations of the stores and the partner supplies the capital to open the store in exchange for a non-controlling interest.
 
We acquired Pie Squared Holdings LLC (“PIE” or “Pie Squared Holdings”) on August 30, 2021. Pie Squared Holdings, directly and through its four wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns, operates and franchises pizza restaurants operating under the tradename PizzaRev. The PizzaRev stores consist of 3 company-owned locations, one of which opened on January 4, 2022, and nine franchised locations. Three of these franchised locations were not open at the time of purchase and are not included in our total store count. One additional franchise location is planned to open in 2022.


The Jantzen Beach, Oregon location was a former Hooters of America location and is only open for online gaming sales, drinks and a limited food menu.
 
Through the use of partnerships, the Company partners with private investors who contribute all or substantially all of the capital required to open a restaurant in return for an ownership interest in the LLC and an economic interest in the net income of the restaurant location. The Company manages the operations of the restaurant in return for a management fee and an economic interest in the net income of the restaurant location. While terms may vary by LLC, the investor generally contributes between $0.3 million and $0.4 million per location and is entitled to 80% of the net income of the LLC until such time as the investor recoups the initial investment and the investor return on net income changes from 80% to 50%. The Company contributes the intellectual property and management related to operating a Little Big Burger, manages the construction, opening and ongoing operations of the store in return for a 5% management fee and 20% of net income until such time as the investor recoups the initial investment and the Company return on net income changes from 20% to 50%.
 
Additionally, we utilize franchise agreements to allow third parties to franchise a restaurant and, thus, are able to utilize the intellectual property, trademark, and trade dress in return for a franchise fee. The franchise agreement provides the franchisee with a designated territory or marketing area for an initial term of 10 years, with four successive five-year renewals. An upfront fee of $40,000 is required along with a $5,000 renewal fee and continuing fees based on a percent of revenues. We recognize the upfront fee allocated to each restaurant as revenue on a straight-line basis over the restaurant’s license term, which generally begins upon the signing of the contract for area development agreements and upon the signing of a store lease for franchise agreements. The payments for these upfront fees are generally received upon contract execution. Continuing fees, which are based upon a percentage of franchisee revenues (typically 5.5%) and are not subject to any constraints, are recognized on the accrual basis as those sales occur. The payments for these continuing fees are generally made on a weekly basis.
 
Franchises must be operated in strict compliance with our operations manual, which prescribes staffing requirements, minimum months, days and hours of operation, techniques and processes for service, length and method of training personnel, working capital and inventory requirements, accounting system and other operational standards. We provide up to five days of on-site training at no charge to franchisee. Additional on-site training may be requested by franchisee and will be provided at a daily rate of $500. We have the right to approve the property lease for each new franchise. We maintain image control and may direct a franchise to remodel. We provide specifications for equipment, safety and security, subject to additional location regulations. Franchisees must utilize designated, approved suppliers or obtain pre-approval of any new supplier. Franchisees have certain prescribed marketing requirements and we may require franchisee to contribute a percentage of net sales to a regional brand development fund. Further, we may require certain of franchisee’s personnel to attend an annual conference or all franchisee’s personnel to attend refresher training, at franchisee’s sole expense.

Franchisees have sole control over the day-to-day operations of the franchise. The franchisee is responsible for the hiring and termination of its personnel and compliance with applicable laws. The franchisee must sell wine and beer at the store and may opt to sell other alcoholic beverages. The franchisee is responsible for obtaining all required business licenses, including liquor licenses and to carry required insurance.
 
Any improvements or new concepts developed by a franchisee (such as improvements to proprietary recipes, equipment, merchandise or software) belong to us. Our franchise agreement contains confidentiality and non-disclosure covenants and a franchisee must require its personnel to execute confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.
 
We hold a minority investment in corporate owned Hooters. However, we do not currently intend to open additional Hooters restaurants.
 
Restaurant Geographic Locations
 
We currently operate ABC, BGR, LBB and PIE restaurants in the United States. ABC is in North Carolina and New York. BGR operates company restaurants in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as franchise locations across the US. LBB operates in Oregon, Washington and North Carolina. PIE operates company restaurants in California, as well as franchise locations in California. We also operate gaming machines in Portland, Oregon under license from the Oregon Lottery Commission.
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is extremely competitive. We compete with other restaurants on the taste, quality and price of our food offerings. Additionally, we compete with other restaurants on service, ambience, location and overall customer experience. We believe that we compete primarily with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining and quick casual establishments, and to a lesser extent with quick service restaurants in general. Many of our competitors are well-established national, regional or local chains and many have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees.
Information Systems and Security
 
Our information is processed, transmitted, and stored in a secure environment using enterprise grade technologies in order to protect both our data and the physical computing assets. While we believe that our internal policies, systems and procedures for cybersecurity are thorough, the risk of a cybersecurity event cannot be eliminated.
Proprietary Rights
 
We have trademarks and tradenames associated with American Burger, BGR, Little Big Burger and PizzaRev. We believe that the trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights that we use in our restaurants have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts. Although we believe that we have sufficient rights to all of our trademarks and service marks, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to market our restaurants and promote our brand. Any such litigation may be costly and divert resources from our business. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may be prevented from using our trademarks or service marks in the future and may be liable for damages.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that affect our business. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in frequently revised state and local government regulations affecting our business, which have significantly impacted our restaurant operations and continue to do so. Regulations relating to opening and closing of restaurant dining rooms or outdoor patios, business hours, sanitation practices, to-go alcohol sales, guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices, and employment and safety-related laws involving contact tracing, exclusions and paid sick leave have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our guests and have adversely impacted our cost structure and resulting profitability of our restaurants.
 
Environmental regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Local regulation
 
Our locations are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, which may include health, sanitation, safety, fire, building and other agencies in the countries, states or municipalities in which the restaurants are located. Opening sites in new areas could be delayed by license and approval processes or by more requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors. Our agreements with our franchisees require them to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
 
Each restaurant requires appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell liquor, beer and wine, and each restaurant requires food service licenses from local health authorities. Our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our employees of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. We are subject to various regulations by foreign governments related to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages and to health, sanitation and fire and safety standards. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.
 
Franchise Regulations
 
We must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and with several state and foreign laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (“FTC Rule”) and certain state and foreign laws require that we furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise disclosure document containing information prescribed by the FTC Rule and applicable state and foreign laws and regulations. We register the disclosure document in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that require registration for the sale of franchises. Our domestic franchise disclosure document complies with FTC Rule and various state disclosure requirements, and our international disclosure documents comply with applicable requirements.
 
We also must comply with state and foreign laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These laws may limit a franchisor’s ability to: terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause; interfere with the right of free association among franchisees; disapprove the transfer of a franchise; discriminate among franchisees regarding charges, royalties and other fees; and place new stores near existing franchises. Bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into the United States Congress on several occasions during the last decade, but none have been enacted.
 
Employment Regulations
 
We are subject to state and federal employment laws that govern our relationship with our employees, such as minimum wage requirements, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements. Many of our employees are paid at rates which are influenced by changes in the federal and state wage regulations. Accordingly, changes in the wage regulations could increase our labor costs. The work conditions at our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and are subject to periodic inspections by this agency. In addition, the enactment of recent legislation and resulting new government regulation relating to healthcare benefits may result in additional cost increases and other effects in the future.
Gaming Regulations
 
We are also subject to regulations in Oregon where we operate gaming machines. Gaming operations are generally highly regulated and conducted under the permission and oversight of the state or local gaming commission, lottery or other government agencies.
Other Regulations
 
Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them readily accessible to disabled persons. We must also make reasonable accommodations for the employment of disabled persons.
 
We are subject to a variety of consumer protection and similar laws and regulations at the federal, state and local level. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to financial and other penalties.
 
Seasonality
 
The sales of our restaurants may peak at various times throughout the year due to certain promotional events, weather and holiday related events. For example, our domestic fast casual restaurants tend to peak in the Spring, Summer and Fall months when the weather is milder. Severe weather including hurricanes, tornados, thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, prolonged extreme temperatures and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes in some of the markets where we operate. Quarterly results also may be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 348 employees in the United States. We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed.
 
Working Capital Practices
 
Historically, we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock, issuance of preferred and common stock, convertible debt instruments, term loans and credit lines from financial institutions, and cash generated from operations. On March 27, 2020, Congress passed The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which included the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) for small businesses. On April 27, 2020, Amergent received a PPP loan in the amount of $2.1 million. On February 25, 2021, the Company received a second PPP loan of $2.0 million. These PPP loans may be forgiven if certain criteria are met.
 
The Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) under the CARES Act is a refundable tax credit which encourages businesses to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company recognized credits of $2.5 million under the ERC program for the year ended December 31, 2021. The program ended on January 1, 2022.
 
The American Rescue Plan Act established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (“RRF”) to provide funding to help restaurants and other eligible businesses keep their doors open during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pie Squared Holdings received a grant under the RRF, and $2.0 million of unused funds received under the RRF at the closing of the acquisition were placed into escrow for the benefit of the Company. The Company recognized $0.5 million in RRF grant income during the year ended December 31, 2021.
