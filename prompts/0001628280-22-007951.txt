Item 1. Business
Company Overview
We are a vertically integrated space company that provides customers with dedicated and rideshare small satellite launch capabilities. Our philosophy is to operate a mobile launch system that can “launch at any time, from any place, to any orbit.” Our vision is to use space to drive positive and lasting change on Earth, from connecting communities, to advancing scientific initiatives; supporting America’s and other nations’ space presence, and helping create the next generation of world-changing space technology.
Since our founding in 2017, we have invested in research and development efforts to develop a unique air-launch system, comprised of Cosmic Girl, a modified Boeing 747 aircraft, and the LauncherOne rocket. Cosmic Girl serves as a reusable mobile launch pad, carrying LauncherOne aloft, and LauncherOne is a two-stage rocket that is the world’s first and only liquid-fueled, air-launched rocket to reach orbit successfully. This mobile system allows us to serve a broad array of applications and markets, providing customers with a highly differentiated solution to launch satellites relative to other existing small satellite ground launch providers.
We believe there is near- and medium-term acceleration in the growth of the space market, driven by rapid advances in launch and satellite technology. As a result, there has been a proliferation of private sector space companies pursuing the growing demand for space solutions across multiple applications. Indeed, there are numerous private small-satellite launch companies (focused on carrying less than 1,000 kg to 500 km low Earth orbit), but just four that are able to boast a successful launch to orbit — SpaceX’s dedicated rideshare program, Northrop Grumman, Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit. As one of the few proven small satellite launch providers, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these attractive industry tailwinds. So far, we successfully completed three orbital launches in 2021 and early 2022, each at the beginning of our targeted launch window, which demonstrates the efficacy of our launch system. To date, we have delivered 26 satellites to their desired orbits with high precision. We believe these features make LauncherOne a system of great interest for responsive space.
By utilizing an air-launch system via Cosmic Girl and the LauncherOne rocket, we offer the agility, flexibility and responsiveness that small satellite customers need to achieve their mission objectives. Our launches have delivered satellites to orbit for customers across commercial, civil and national security and defense markets, both domestically and internationally. Leveraging the successes from these launches, we have been able to secure active contracts representing approximately $575.2 million of potential revenue, of which $151.5 million are binding agreements and $423.7 million are non-binding Memoranda of Understanding (“MOUs”) and Letters of Intent (“LOIs”).
We develop and manufacture our launch technology from a vertically-integrated manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California. Leveraging advanced, state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities, including automation and additive manufacturing technologies, we believe we have the necessary infrastructure in-place to meet the medium-term demand for our launch business.
Our diverse portfolio is organized across three core offerings:
•Commercial & Civil: We provide dedicated and rideshare launch services for commercial and civil customers, both from the United States and internationally. This offering also includes civil spaceports, where a foreign nation can buy or lease our mobile launch system ground equipment, aircraft and launch system to provide in-country launch capabilities, allowing these countries to become spacefaring through existing airport infrastructure.
•National Security and Defense: We provide national security launch and mission services to the U.S. and its allied Government customers, including the Space Force, Air Force and other agencies within the U.S. Department of Defense (the “DoD”) and the intelligence community. We also intend to offer government squadron services wherein the entire air-launch system will be a program of record sold to government customers who will own and operate the system directly, providing enhanced flexibility and responsiveness. Additionally, due to the distinct features of LauncherOne, which is itself a hypersonic system, we can also provide solutions for missile defense target applications and other key hypersonic research and development and demonstration activities.
•Space Solutions: Leveraging existing launch capabilities and our track record as a systems integrator, we seek to provide end-to-end value-added services for Internet of Things (“IoT”) and Earth Observation (“EO”) applications through the combination of agreements with satellite operators and a satellite constellation we will own and operate. Using a satellite-as-a-service model, we plan to deploy our own procured satellites beginning in late 2023 to serve government and commercial customers, both domestically and internationally.
Industry Overview
We operate within the large and growing space economy, with the total addressable market for Virgin Orbit’s services expected to be $75 billion by 2030. This rapid growth is being driven by various factors, the most significant being the reduced costs for both launch and satellite manufacturing due to technological advancements. As a result, space solutions have proliferated across multiple end markets, including communications, maritime, logistics, and importantly, national security and defense.
Over the last decade, space technology has advanced on multiple fronts, including increases in satellite bandwidth and throughput, which allows for high-rate data transfer, utilization of consumer electronics and integrated circuit advancements allowing for miniaturization of satellite components, which reduces satellite developmental costs, and increases overall system efficiencies and expanded reach and global coverage from satellites in LEO. The private sector has played a meaningful role in the evolution of space technology, whereas historically innovation was almost entirely government-driven.
Space is viewed as crucial to national security and defense, as nations rely on space solutions for critical communications, precise location information, navigation capabilities and broader global monitoring. The U.S. Government and its allies are focused on maintaining and evolving space capabilities, while also thwarting anti-satellite rocket technologies that are being developed and tested by adversaries. 
Our Products & Services Overview
We have a diverse portfolio of space offerings, spanning various end markets and applications. Our portfolio is organized into three main offerings, each leveraging our underlying launch technology and core capabilities.
Commercial & Civil
•Commercial & Civil Launch: Caters to the launch demands of commercial and civil customers both in the United States and international markets, including customers such as Arqit and SatRevolution, and civil customers, such as NASA. We offer these customers dedicated, primary or secondary rideshare satellite launch services to any orbit with both timing and launch location flexibility given the mobility and responsiveness of our system. A dedicated launch is one in which the customer buys the entire launch payload (mass & volume). In a rideshare launch, there are several payload customers, including a primary rideshare customer (who determines the mission parameters) and secondary rideshare customer(s) whose payloads utilize the remaining mass and volume capacity not utilized by the primary. Dedicated and primary rideshare customers can inject their payloads directly into their desired orbits without the time loss associated with traveling from one orbit to another, thereby providing them the option to achieve an earlier revenue stream. Moreover, the architecture of the air-launch system is designed for a more reliable and agile launch cadence than the traditional ground-launch rideshare system adopted by many of our competitors such as SpaceX or Rocket Lab. The responsiveness of our system is also critical for supporting the operation and maintenance of satellite constellations in instances where a satellite malfunctions and needs urgent replacement.
•Civil Spaceports: The unique modularity of the LauncherOne system permits launches from any government licensed horizontal spaceport with a runway long enough to support a Boeing 747-400 aircraft. We leverage fully transportable GSE (ground-support equipment required for launch operations) to eliminate the need for extensive infrastructure investments traditionally associated with ground launch applications. We are also in the process of bringing flexible launch for small satellites to a global network of spaceports and countries across the world. Currently, we are seeking to commence LauncherOne operations from both Spaceport Cornwall at Cornwall Airport Newquay (NQY) in the UK as soon as the summer of 2022 and at Oita Airport (OIT) in Japan in the coming years. We are also in discussions with various other countries on the prospects of leveraging their existing aircraft runway infrastructure to adopt our spaceport product offering and develop in-country launch capabilities.
National Security
•National Security Launch and Squadron Services: Provides launch services for national security and defense customers such as the U.S. Government and its allies. We believe our launch system is particularly attractive to these customers because of its capability for anonymity; our ability to fly Cosmic Girl to, and launch from, different locations makes it difficult for our adversaries to predict timing and location of launch, as compared with a static ground-based launch pad, making it highly attractive for National Security customers that prioritize operation covertness. Moreover, the resiliency and responsiveness of the system is especially important should there be a need to replace critical satellites that go out of operation. We believe that our squadron services offering, in which we expect to deliver turnkey capability through the sale of equipment as well as services to the U.S. Government, is of increased interest as it facilitates the necessary capabilities for the Space Force to responsively and independently deploy appropriate assets against the U.S. Government’s adversaries, a previously non-existent capability.
•Missile Defense Targets and Hypersonic Applications: Hypersonics (high-speed systems or devices that travel at speeds over Mach 5) are a growing area of focus for the DoD, especially as several foreign nations race to build military capabilities in this area for offensive purposes. With our system’s ability to achieve hypersonic speeds and our deep connectivity within the DoD, we believe we are well-positioned to support and complement the various Hypersonic Training, Testing and Exercising (“TT&E”) activities and develop advanced defense mechanisms for the U.S. Government. As missile defense is a core part of the U.S. defense strategy, we believe LauncherOne is able to serve as a cost-effective alternative to expensive targets that are currently in use for research and development efforts by the Missile Defense Agency (“MDA”). We have an on-going contract with MDA to demonstrate the utility of LauncherOne for MDA target applications.
Space Solutions
•IoT Solutions: Currently under development, this solution seeks to provide end-to-end value-added services for the smart mobility and smart logistics sectors of the IoT market. Key areas of focus include:
◦Connected ship management: expected to track and monitor shipping assets across the globe in real-time and provide improved connectivity at sea;
◦Connected aircraft management: expected to track and monitor aircraft across the globe in real-time and provide improved connectivity in air;
◦Pipeline monitoring: expected to monitor pipeline status and potential leaks in real-time providing customers the opportunity to mitigate losses by proactively addressing issues in the system; and
◦Smart agriculture: expected to track and monitor weather and soil data for precision farming applications.
•EO Solutions: Also under development, this solution seeks to develop multi-modal imaging offerings in an integrated suite including data collection methodologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), operational electronic intelligence, infrared-hyperspectral and electro-optical imagery techniques. We believe applications for this offering include maritime domain awareness, public safety, insurance, agriculture, mining,, oil and gas.
Our Launch System
Through years of research and development, we have in place a proprietary system that enables us to provide key launch capabilities. This is comprised of:
•Cosmic Girl: Cosmic Girl is a modified Boeing 747-400 aircraft that serves as a reusable mobile launch platform. This allows our launch system to be fully mobile and to launch payloads into orbit with an 
unprecedented level of flexibility. The interior of the aircraft has been modified to support minimal maintenance requirements and the upper deck has been outfitted to support onboard launch operations with just two pilots and two launch engineers. One of the most important modifications is the pylon, which is used to carry the LauncherOne rocket up to approximately 35,000 feet where it is released for launch. Using Cosmic Girl as an aerial launch platform enables our rocket to be more efficient, benefiting from the initial altitude (35K feet), speed (approximately 85% of the speed of sound at launch) and aerodynamics (air density approximately 30% of sea level) as compared with a typical ground launch. We expect our future research and development efforts in this area will include the modification of a cargo Boeing 747 aircraft that would be a fully transportable, self-contained launch system that can carry the rocket, payloads and GSE to anywhere in the world.
•LauncherOne: LauncherOne is a two-stage rocket used to launch satellites into orbit. It is the world’s first and only liquid-fueled, air-launched rocket to reach orbit successfully. It is engineered for optimal performance in conjunction with Cosmic Girl and has the lowest launch cost per kilogram among small rocket ground launchers. The rocket, designed for simplicity, has an all-carbon composite design with liner-less tanks, thereby increasing system reliability and increasing production efficiency. With its one engine per stage design, the system has enhanced resilience. Our nearest competitor, Rocket Lab, has 11 engines versus our two. This is a key advantage for our system since engines have the highest risk of failure in a rocket. Our on-board autonomous range safety systems further enhance system reliability and eliminates the need for extensive ground safety infrastructure. LauncherOne is designed to carry payloads of approximately 300 kilograms, with expected future versions allowing for potential payloads of up to 500 kilograms.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths include:
•Unique Launch Technology: By launching our rockets from a modified Boeing 747-400 aircraft flying at nearly Mach 1 speeds, we believe that we have disrupted the paradigm of ground-based launch, which has been largely unchanged for 60 years. Our technology provides a more flexible, responsive platform, which we estimate to be approximately 30% more efficient than equivalent ground-based systems. We have the lowest inherent launch cost per kilogram among small rocket launchers. The mobility and responsiveness of the system offers the capacity to launch from any government-licensed horizontal spaceport that can support a Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which enables our rocket to achieve any desired orbit. The anonymity, responsiveness and resiliency of our system is also particularly unique and enhances the value proposition to our defense sector customers.
•Balanced, End-to-end Portfolio of Space Offerings: Our portfolio mix is well-balanced across customer type, geographic reach, and product and solution offerings. With an established launch system, we are able to cater to a wide range of customers, including civil, commercial and national security, both within the US and internationally. It has also provided us a great platform to expand into military offerings such as defensive hypersonics and missile defense systems, as well as provide new capabilities for DoD responsive space. We also expect to operate and maintain our own satellite constellation systems to develop IoT and EO applications.
•Vertically-integrated, Well-invested and Scalable Manufacturing Facility: We are over 90% vertically integrated, with approximately 195,000 square feet of factory and payload processing facilities in Long Beach, California and propulsion, test and launch operation facilities in Mojave, California. Our factory leverages advanced manufacturing techniques and our production lines are highly scalable, with specially designed work-flow cells that are constructed to be efficiently replicated with ease as our production demands increase.
•Deep Government Relationships Across the U.S. Government and Allies: We have a demonstrated track record with government and national security contracts, with contracts from the Space Force, Air Force and others, in addition to being selected for the Orbital Services Program-4 (“OSP-4”) IDIQ and participating in the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS-2) exercise with USSPACECOM in September 2020. We have and expect to continue to leverage the extensive reach of the U.S. Government and alignment with allies to expand our engagement internationally. We are also under contract to deliver launch services for the RAF and have deployed satellites for the Royal Netherlands Air Force.
•International Reach: We have launched satellites for multiple international customers, including the Royal Netherlands Air Force (in 2021) and SatRevolution, a Polish commercial company (in 2021 and 2022), and we have future launches planned for multiple additional international customers. Through our mobile system, we have a unique ability to also serve international customers from their own soil, as demonstrated by our announced plans to launch from foreign civil spaceports including the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil. Our first international launch is expected from Cornwall, United Kingdom in 2022. In 2021, we were invited to Cornwall for the G7 summit where we met with The Prime Minister of the UK and The Prime Minister of Australia. In addition, a pilot from the UK’s Royal Air Force has been assigned on loan to us, for a period of up to five years, to learn to conduct launches from Cosmic Girl.
•Environmentally Responsible Technology Offering: Most traditional ground launch bases are protected wildlife reserves (for example, Astra’s Kodiak Island in Alaska, and SpaceX’s Cape Canaveral in Florida), selected due to the need to have launch facilities away from areas of human population. Ground-based launch systems are typically a significant contributor to air, ground and noise pollution because of the smoke and soot that gets released, along with the sound of the actual blast that takes place at ground level upon rocket ignition. All of these factors have significant impacts to the otherwise pristine areas of natural beauty that our competitors use for launch operations. Our air-launch system, on the other hand, provides an advantage to ground-based systems by minimizing impact to the local environment. The environmental and noise pollution of our air-launch system occurs at an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet, significantly reducing the sound and carbon emissions to the local area and the impact to local wildlife.
•Virgin Brand: The Virgin brand brings a proven track record of innovation, reliability and delivering exceptional customer experiences as well as a proven flight track record. Virgin’s reach has been instrumental in developing key customer relationships across civil, commercial and national security and defense markets. In our space solutions business, Virgin Group’s family of companies has also provided key potential anchor partners for our targeted applications, including the potential for us to provide connected ship management capabilities to Virgin Voyages and connected aircraft management capabilities to Virgin Atlantic, for example.
•Highly Experienced Management Team: Our team has extensive experience leading successful space companies. Our CEO, Dan Hart has over three decades of experience at Boeing, where he most recently served as Vice President of Government Satellite Systems. Our senior engineering and manufacturing teams have experience from legacy space companies such as Raytheon Technologies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin to new space companies such as SpaceX and OneWeb/Airbus-OneWeb Satellites. Additionally, our teams have worked on a significant number of industry-defining space programs, including Delta II, IV, SpaceX Falcon 9 and GMD, among others.
Our Growth Strategy
We are pursuing several strategies to drive growth:
•Leveraging our success from the most recent launches to capture a greater share of the launch market from our competitors, especially targeting customers who are looking for dedicated launch opportunities;
•Becoming the key launch provider, through both our own responsive launch services as well as squadron sales, for our national security and defense sector customers, given our unique air-launch system;
•Expanding the engagement with our national security and defense sector customers to include missile defense targets and hypersonic applications, given the differentiated technical specifications of LauncherOne;
•Expanding our offerings internationally by leveraging our spaceport franchise;
•Expanding our manufacturing capabilities to accommodate the growing demands of our customers;
•Establishing our space solutions segment to become an end-to-end provider of value-added services in specific EO and IoT applications where we believe we are best positioned; and
•Securing additional anchor customers for our space solutions offering by leveraging our existing relationships with Virgin Group and Mubadala.
Our space solutions business will focus on IoT connectivity and EO applications, specifically in the areas of Electro Optics, Synthetic Aperture Radar, Operational Electronic Intelligence, and Hyperspectral Short-Wave and Mid-Wave Infrared multi-intelligence. We will seek to acquire capacity for our space solutions business through some of our customers. To that end, we have invested or agreed to invest in Hypersat LLC, Horizon Technologies, SAS, and Arqit and are looking at other candidates. In parallel, we are also developing our own satellites working with a major industry supplier, which we believe will enable us to launch four satellites in 2023. Our objective is to fuse data that we gather and provide data analytics services tailored for customers.
On the national security and defense front, missile defense target and hypersonics segments are fast growing sections of the DoD budget, with the hypersonic segments expected to grow at a 21% compound annual growth rate from 2021 through 2025, highlighting the increasing focus on technological advancement within the sector according to the National Defense Magazine in November 2020.
Our first international launch is expected from Spaceport Cornwall in 2022. In 2021, we were invited to Cornwall for the G7 summit where we met with the Prime Minister of the U.K. and the Prime Minister of Australia. In addition to our activities at Cornwall, the Brazilian Government has invited us to provide air-launch services at Alcantara Space Center with launches expected to commence as early as 2023. We have also completed the first phase of a program at Spaceport Japan in Oita, which was established in collaboration with the Space Port Japan Association and ANA Japan to provide an air-launch service commencing in 2023. We are also engaged in discussions with several other countries.
Additionally, our launch system benefits from transportability, mobility and weather resistance, which makes it ideal for a tactically responsive space launch. We currently have contracts with the U.S. Space Force and the intelligence community that are taking advantage of these attributes and we are also in discussions with the U.S. Government to provide operationally responsive space capabilities to enable new options for military leaders and a deterrence to those wishing to bring aggression to low earth orbit. Rapid and responsive reconstitution, augmentation, and replenishment of space assets will enable the United States to counter or deter aggressive behavior through quick characterization and attribution of threats and rapid response options to mitigate them. This capability does not currently exist within the U.S. Space Command and represents an emergent operational need.
Customers
Through our last three launches, we have been able to cater to domestic and international customers from each of our core focus sectors including: NASA, International Ministries of Defense (“MoDs”), US DoD, US intelligence community, and Commercial international constellation providers. Our commercial customers include satellite and constellation providers such as Arqit and SatRevolution. Our civil customers mostly fall within our spaceport offering and our launch offerings for civil space agencies, including NASA. We have announced plans to launch from several spaceports including:
•United Kingdom: Spaceport in Cornwall, which was established in collaboration with the U.K. Space Agency and the U.K. Ministry of Defense.
•Japan: Spaceport in Oita, which will be established in collaboration with Space Port Japan Association and ANA Japan; and
•Brazil: Spaceport at Alcantara Space Center, which will be established with the support of Brazilian Space Agency & Brazil’s Air Force.
Outside of Spaceports, we provide dedicated launch services for space agencies. To-date, we have established a track record of successful launches for NASA and intend to expand to other national civil space agencies. In particular, we intend to work with governments that have space agencies but lack their own infrastructure for domestic space launch. We have also established relationships, deployed satellites, and have on-going contracts with numerous customers in the national security and defense sector, including the Space Force, the U.S. Air Force, the National Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”) and the MDA. Our current customer pipeline includes parties that have signed binding Launch Service Agreements (“LSAs”) or nonbinding MOUs and LOIs, or with whom there are proposals and contracts under negotiation with an internally calculated high probability of win (“Pwin”) rate. This pipeline has significant diversity, with over 100 unique customers identified. We are not dependent on any major customer or customers given our current diverse customer pipeline.
Sales & Marketing
We sell our commercial and civil, and national security and defense launch services through a high-quality business development team with deep connectivity across the orbital launch customer base. We market our services through two distinct organizations, one devoted to commercial and civil applications, and one devoted to U.S. Government applications. We believe this distinction is advantageous as it provides the necessary safeguards to handle classified information and to deliver against sensitive governmental mission briefs.
We boast a global organization for commercial and civil applications, focusing on non-national security customers, commercial customers, as well as civil agencies both in the United States and internationally, such as NASA, the U.K. Space Agency, and the Space Port Japan Association.
Our organization for U.S. Government applications is based entirely in the United States, focusing exclusively on U.S. Government customers such as the DoD, Air Force, Space Force, and the MDA, as well as other national security-focused U.S. Government agencies.
These business development teams work closely with our broader corporate organization, in particular our engineers and flight technicians, to develop and deliver optimal solutions for our customers. The team benefits from a depth of experience, with many having served in senior leadership positions for government agencies, and leading space and aerospace companies. We believe their prior experience not only benefits the products and services that we offer, but also provides deep connectivity to our customers.
In order to build brand awareness and disseminate information regarding our products and services, we have established a broad marketing effort, including:
•Conferences and industry events at which we participate, sponsor, exhibit and speak;
•Press releases and media engagement;
•Social media postings;
•Merchandising;
•Cooperative marketing efforts with customers; and
•General marketing collateral such as our website, user guides, data sheets, presentations, live streams and videos.
Moreover, we believe we benefit from the strength of the Virgin brand and being part of the wider family of more than 40 Virgin-branded businesses, which employ over 60,000 people in more than 30 countries and span multiple sectors: travel and leisure, health and wellness, music and entertainment, telecoms and media, financial services and space.
Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations
Virgin Orbit’s is headquartered in Long Beach, CA having a combined facility of 195,000 square feet. The main building (Conant) is 151,000 square feet and houses office space and a large manufacturing floor and our second building (McGowen) is 44,000 square feet and houses training, customer experience, offices, payload processing and additional manufacturing space. Since moving in to the Long Beach facilities, we have invested significantly in our production facilities, which will allow us to scale rapidly over the next few years. The vast majority of our design, engineering, manufacturing, integration, assembly and test activities occur in our main building. Our engineering team works directly adjacent to the LauncherOne production and assembly line, which features state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and custom-built test rigs. Our automated composites fabrication process enables us to build rocket tanks in days versus months. We also have a relationship with DMG MORI that allows us to leverage their advanced manufacturing technology helping reduce cycle time by up to 10 times for key components. Our operations are highly integrated, with over 90% of each rocket built in-house. There are currently four rockets in production and our facility has the tooling, processes and technology to support a production capacity up to 20 rockets annually. The factory is highly scalable with easy expansion of production capabilities through floor space addition and optimization and additional copies of key tooling.
Our McGowen building is located near our headquarters in Long Beach and houses our payload processing facility where our customers’ payloads are encapsulated after spacecraft receipt, inspection and testing are completed. The Virgin Orbit team conducts high-energy testing near the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, where there are multiple custom-built test stands for liquid propulsion, composite tank, component, and overall stage testing. Acceptance testing for LauncherOne’s Newton family of engines occurs at our horizontal test stands, and stage tests are performed on vertical test stands.
Supply Chain
Our ability to manufacture and operate our rockets is dependent upon sufficient availability of raw materials and supplied components, including RP-1 (which is our rocket fuel) and hydrogen, helium, liquid oxygen and nitrogen, which are the gases used in our rockets.
We obtain raw materials and components from reputable and reliable suppliers, following established internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied raw materials and components meet all necessary quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and components from multiple sources, in some cases raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. In these situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this risk through using material requirements planning, including material forecasting and planning, safety stock, and bulk and advance buying with focused efforts on long-lead items.
Competition
Our main competitors fall into four categories:
•Established air-launch providers, with proof of delivering payloads into orbit, of which there is one known operational competitor, Northrop Grumman;
•Established vertical ground launch providers, with proof of delivering payloads into orbit, including SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, International Launch Services (ILS) and Rocket Lab, as well as foreign space agencies such as Arianespace, Roscosmos (GK Launch Services), ISC Kosmotras, the Indian Space Research Organisation’s PSLV, Japan’s H-2 and H-3 and the European Space Agency’s Vega;
•Companies that are reported to have plans to provide launch vehicles that are capable of regularly delivering payloads into orbit, but that have not deployed an operational payload or launched successfully, including Astra Space, Inc., ABL, Relativity Space, Firefly Aerospace, Southern Launch and LandSpace; and
•Space solutions providers offering combined IoT and EO services, as well as a range of on-orbit services, such as BlackSky, Spire, Planet Labs, StarLink, OneWeb and China Spacesat.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully as a commercial provider of satellite launch services does and will depend on a number of factors, including:
•Flight track record, reliability and simplicity of launches;
•Launch technical performance;
•Responsiveness and ability to launch on demand;
•Environmental responsibility and reusability of the system;
•Ability to quickly grow market share and scale;
•Customer experience; and
•Price competitiveness and advantage.
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees, and we seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our supplier and business partners. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, and we will pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.

Governmental Regulation
Federal Aviation Administration
The regulations, policies and guidance issued by the FAA apply to the use and operation of the LauncherOne system. Once a notification of intent to launch is transmitted to FAA, the FAA’s commercial space transportation requirements apply. Operators of launch vehicles are required to have proper licenses, permits and authorizations from the FAA and comply with the FAA’s insurance requirements for third-party liability and government property. While Cosmic Girl is currently registered with the FAA, in the event of a change in ownership, the FAA license will be updated with current information. In that instance, once any such new vehicle registration applications are filed, the applications will serve as registrations until the FAA issues the new vehicle registrations, which will allow operations to continue during that period.
When not operating in a launch mode (Cosmic Girl and a fully-loaded LauncherOne), Cosmic Girl is regulated under an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate by the FAA. The FAA is responsible for the regulation and oversight of matters relating to experimental aircraft, the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA aircraft certification and maintenance, and other matters affecting air safety and operations.
Failure to comply with the FAA’s aviation or space transportation regulations may result in civil penalties or private lawsuits, or the suspension or revocation of licenses or permits, which would prevent operating the LauncherOne system.
Informed Consent and Waiver
Commercial spaceflight operations and any third-party claims that arise from operation of spaceflights are subject to federal laws governing informed consents and waivers of claims.
Our launch system utilizes pilots and launch engineers on Cosmic Girl during a launch operation. Per federal regulation 14 CFR §460.9, Virgin Orbit is required to have all flight crew members (pilots and launch engineers) sign an informed consent stating that “The United States Government has not certified the launch vehicle and any reentry vehicle as safe for carrying flight crew or space flight participants.” Virgin Orbit holds these consent forms and transmits them to FAA-AST.
Per federal regulation 14 CFR §440 Appendix B, Virgin Orbit is also required to obtain a Waiver of Claims from the payload provider and U.S. Government. This form will waive and release claims between Virgin Orbit, the payload provider, and the U.S. Government. All operators with an FAA-license for commercial launches and reentries are covered by this federal indemnification and are required to carry insurance in amounts up to the maximum probable loss level likely to occur in an accident subject to a cap. In the instance of a catastrophic loss, U.S. law provides that the federal government will pay up to $3.0 billion to indemnify the operator above the levels covered by insurance.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Controls
Our launch services business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) and the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”). The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
The U.S. Government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. Government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime with respect to the spaceflight business.
Many different types of internal controls and efforts are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain a registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. Government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance of services for foreign persons, related to and that support our launch services business. The authorization requirements include the need to get permission to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons. The inability to secure and maintain necessary licenses and other authorizations could negatively affect our ability to compete successfully or to operate our launch services business as planned. Any changes in the export control regulations or U.S. Government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement U.S. Government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations.
Failures by us to comply with export control laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges, debarment from government contracts, or limitations on our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government.
Corporate Information and Development
We were initially formed on January 11, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company (“NextGen”) and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. From the time of our formation to the time of the consummation of the Business Combination, our name was “NextGen Acquisition Corp. II.”
On August 22, 2021, we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pulsar Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of NextGen (“Merger Sub”), and Vieco USA, Inc. (“Vieco USA”). On December 29, 2021, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and following approval by our shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held December 28, 2021:
•we filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary accompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, under which NextGen was domesticated and continues as a Delaware corporation, changing its name to “Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc.” (the “Domestication”);
•all outstanding shares of Vieco USA common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, and, together with shares of Vieco USA common stock reserved in respect of options to purchase shares of Vieco USA common stock (the “Vieco USA Options”) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (exclusive of any Vieco USA Options that have an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration of $12.50, which were cancelled without consideration) that were converted into awards based on our common stock, were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, or the reservation of, an aggregate of 310,000,000 shares of common stock (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share), which, in the case of Vieco USA Options, were shares underlying awards based on common stock, representing a fully-diluted pre-transaction equity value of Vieco USA of $3.1 billion; and
•Merger Sub was merged with and into Vieco USA, with Vieco USA surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Business Combination” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”).
In connection with the Business Combination:
•each of the then issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of NextGen (“Class A ordinary shares”) converted automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Virgin Orbit (the “common stock”);
•each of the then issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of NextGen (“Class B ordinary shares”) converted automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock;
•each then issued and outstanding warrant of NextGen converted automatically into a warrant to acquire one share of common stock, pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2021, between NextGen and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Warrant Agreement”); and
•each of the then issued and outstanding units of NextGen that had not been previously separated into the underlying Class A ordinary share and underlying warrant upon the request of the holder thereof (the “units”) were cancelled and entitled the holder thereof to one share of common stock and one-fifth of one warrant. No fractional warrants were issued upon separation of the units.
