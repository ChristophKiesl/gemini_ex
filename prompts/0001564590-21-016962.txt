 Company Overview 
 We are an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. Our lead product candidate, the HEPZATO™ KIT (melphalan hydrochloride for injection/hepatic delivery system), or HEPZATO™, is a drug/device combination product. HEPZATO is designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects. In Europe, our commercial product is a stand-alone medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT® Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.
 
Our clinical development program (“CDP”) for HEPZATO is comprised of the FOCUS Clinical Trial for Patients with Hepatic Dominant Ocular Melanoma (the “FOCUS Trial”), a global registration clinical trial that is investigating objective response rate in metastatic ocular melanoma, or mOM, and the ALIGN Trial, a global Phase 3 clinical trial for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or ICC (the “ALIGN Trial”). The FOCUS Trial initiated treatment on the final enrolled patient on October 2, 2020. Presently, we have paused our work on the ALIGN Trial while we reevaluate the trial design and in order to be able to concentrate our efforts on the FOCUS Trial conclusion and subsequent NDA filing. We are currently reviewing the incidence, unmet need, available efficacy data and development requirements for a broad set of liver cancers in order to select a portfolio of follow-on indications which will maximize the value of the HEPZATO platform. Whether we continue the ALIGN Trial will be dependent on the relative value of the ICC indication versus other alternative indications. In addition, our CDP also includes a registry for CHEMOSAT commercial cases performed in Europe and sponsorship of select investigator-initiated trials or IITs.
 In the United States, HEPZATO is considered a combination drug and device product regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Primary jurisdiction for regulation of HEPZATO has been assigned to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The FDA has granted Delcath six orphan drug designations (five for melphalan in ocular melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumor indications and one for doxorubicin in the hepatocellular carcinoma indication). HEPZATO has not been approved for sale in the United States.
 In Europe, CHEMOSAT is regulated as a Class IIb medical device and received its CE Mark in 2012. We are commercializing CHEMOSAT in select markets in the United Kingdom and the European Union, or EU, where we believe the prospect of securing reimbursement coverage for the use of CHEMOSAT is strongest. 
 Cancers in the Liver—A Significant Unmet Need 
 According to the American Cancer Society’s, or ACS, Cancer Facts & Figures 2021 report, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 608,570 deaths and 1.9 million new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2021. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 10 million deaths and 19.3 million new cases in 2020 according to GLOBOCAN, the database of the International Association of Cancer Registries. The financial burden of cancer is enormous for patients, their families and society. The Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research estimates that the direct medical costs (total of all healthcare expenditures) for cancer in the United States in 2015 was $80.2 billion. The liver is often the life-limiting organ for cancer patients and cancer that spreads to the liver is one of the leading causes of cancer death. Cancer that begins in one area of the body often metastasizes to the liver. Patient prognosis is generally poor once cancer has spread to the liver. Consequently, cancers of the liver remain a major unmet medical need globally. 
 Liver Cancers—Incidence and Mortality 
 Cancers of the liver consist of primary liver cancer and metastatic liver cancer. Primary liver cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma or ICC) originates in the liver or biliary tissue and is particularly prevalent in populations where the primary risk factors for the disease, such as hepatitis-B, hepatitis-C, high levels of alcohol consumption, aflatoxin, cigarette smoking and exposure to industrial pollutants, are present. Metastatic liver cancer, also called liver metastasis, or secondary liver cancer, results from the spread or “metastases” of a primary cancer into the liver. These metastases often continue to grow even after the primary cancer in another part of the body has been removed. Given the vital biological functions of the liver, including processing nutrients from food and filtering toxins from the blood, it is not uncommon for metastases to settle in the liver. In many cases patients die not as a result of their primary cancer, but from the tumors that metastasize to their liver. In the United States, metastatic liver disease is more prevalent than primary liver cancer.

The liver is a difficult organ to treat for certain cancers. Current liver treatment options include surgery, systemic drugs, and minimally invasive or liver directed options.  Surgery options include surgical resections, liver transplants, and isolated hepatic perfusion.  Systemic options include systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Minimally invasive options include external beam radiation therapy and liver directed procedures.  Liver directed (interventional oncology) procedures in the liver are performed by an interventional radiologist.  These procedures include trans arterial chemoembolization (TACE, DEBTACE) and Radioembolization (SIRT, TARE, or Y90).  We believe that CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO represent an important advancement in regional therapy for liver directed treatment of primary liver cancer and certain other cancers metastatic to the liver and are uniquely positioned to treat the entire liver either as a standalone therapy or as a complement to other therapies.
 Ocular Melanoma 
 Ocular melanoma frequently metastasizes to the liver. Based on third party research that we commissioned in 2018, approximately 5,000-6,200 cases of ocular melanoma are diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually, and approximately 50% of these patients will develop metastatic disease. Of metastatic cases of ocular melanoma, approximately 90% of patients develop liver involvement. According to Lane et al., JAMA Ophthalmol. 2018 Sep 1;136(9):981-98, once ocular melanoma has spread to the liver, median overall survival for these patients is generally 3.9 months (untreated) to 6.3 months (treated). There is no one standard of care for patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases. Based on 2018 research, an estimate
d 2,500-3,100 patients with ocular melanoma liver metastases in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU may be eligible for treatment with HEPZATO annually. Based on our reimbursement experience with CHEMOSAT, we estimate the annual addressable market for this indication in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU is approximately $300 million per year. 
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma 
 Primary liver cancers include HCC and ICC. According to GLOBOCAN 2020, an estimated 68,500 new cases of primary liver cancer are diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually. According to the ACS, approximately 42,230 new cases of these cancers are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2021, leading to approximately 30,230 deaths. 
 ICC is the second most common form of primary liver cancer and according to Wang et al., 2013 J Clin Oncol 31:1188-1195 accounts for 5-30% of primary liver cancers diagnosed in the United States and Europe annually. We believe that 90% of ICC patients are not candidates for surgical resection, and that approximately 20-30% of these may be candidates for certain focal interventions. According to third party research that we commissioned in 2018 we estimate that approximately 11,000 ICC patients in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU annually could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT.
 Colorectal Cancer
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers in the US and Europe and has a high metastatic rate to the liver.  GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates 288,230 colorectal cancer diagnosis per year in the US and Western Europe, UK, and Italy.  According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States approximately 149,500  diagnoses are expected in 2021 leading to 52,980 deaths. 
 Recent advances in the treatment of primary colorectal cancer have shown encouraging increases in 5-year survival; however, the presence of metastasis is an indicator for increased mortality probability.  Approximately 25% of patients will present with liver metastasis at the time of initial primary disease diagnosis.  Clark et al., J Gastrointest Oncol. 2014;5(5):374-387. We estimate that approximately 98,000 CRC patients in the US, the United Kingdom and the EU annually could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT.
 Breast Cancer
 Breast cancer (BC) is the most diagnosed cancer in women in the US and worldwide.  The American Cancer Society estimates that 281,550 women will be diagnosed with BC in the US annually.  BC is the second leading cancer-related cause of death for women (behind lung cancer) in the US.  GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates are that there are 726,259 annual diagnosis for breast cancer in the US and Western Europe and UK.  Recent advances in primary breast cancer treatments have given patients a high 5-year survival rate. The prognosis for patients with breast cancer liver metastasis, however, remains poor. 
 Approximately 18% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will also have distant metastatic disease, in which 5% of these patients will have liver only metastasis.  Eventually 50% of all metastatic patients will see their disease progress to the liver in addition to their initial diagnosed metastatic site and in 20% of these patient’s liver progression is the cause of mortality. Deipolyi AR, et al.J Vasc Inter Radiol. 2018;29(9):1226-1235. Treatments options for patients with multiple sites of  metastatic disease vary.  We estimate that approximately 6,000 breast cancer patients with hepatic only involvement in the US and Western Europe (including the UK and Italy) could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT.  An additional 10,000 patients could receive benefits from HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT in the palliative setting based on local treatment guidelines.

Neuroendocrine Cancer
 Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)  or neuroendocrine neoplasia are a rare group of cancers that originate in neuroendocrine cells.  NETs can originate anywhere in the body, the most common sites include the digestive tract, rectum, lungs, pancreas, or appendix. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) estimates that there are 12,000 new diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors each year in the United States, and a total of 21,500 in the US and Europe. 
 According to Pape et al. 2008. Endocrine-Related Cancer. 15(4), 1083-1097 NETs have a metastasis rate of between 60-80% and the majority of these accruing in the liver (85%).  We estimate that approximately 12,000 NETs patients in the US, the United Kingdom and the EU annually could be candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT.
 Pancreatic Cancer
 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma comes with a poor prognosis for those diagnosed with the disease.  The American Cancer Society estimates that pancreatic cancer will affect 60,430 patients annually, with 48,200 annual deaths in the US.  Along with GLOBOCAN estimates for Western Europe, UK and Italy, pancreatic cancer effects a total of 132,442 patients annually with 105,638 annual deaths.
 Upon diagnosis nearly 75% of patients will have liver metastasis and 58% of those patients will have liver only metastasis. Metastatic pancreatic cancer proves to be a fast-progressing cancer that once metastasizes leaves the patients limited treatment options. Oweira, et al. World J Gastroenterol. 2017;23(10):1872-1880. We estimate there are approximately 57,600  US and Western Europe (including UK and Italy) new pancreatic cancer patients each year with hepatic only involvement.  Given the rapid progression of the disease it is unknown  at this time the estimated number of candidates for treatment with HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT.
 About CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO 
 Our product administers concentrated regional chemotherapy to the liver. This “whole organ” therapy is performed by isolating the circulatory system of the liver, infusing the liver with a chemotherapeutic agent, and then filtering the blood prior to returning it to the patient’s circulatory system. During the procedure, known as percutaneous hepatic perfusion, PHP®, or PHP therapy, three catheters are placed percutaneously through standard interventional radiology techniques. The catheters temporarily isolate the liver from the body’s circulatory system, allow administration of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride directly to the liver, and collect blood exiting the liver for filtration by our proprietary filters. The filters adsorb chemotherapeutic agent in the blood, thereby reducing systemic exposure to the drug and related toxic side effects before the filtered blood is returned to the patient’s circulatory system.
 PHP therapy is performed in an interventional radiology suite in approximately two to three hours. Patients remain in an intensive care or step-down unit overnight for observation following the procedure. Treatment with CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO is repeatable, and a new disposable system is used for each treatment. Patients treated in clinical settings are permitted up to six treatments. In commercial treatment settings, patients have received up to eight treatments. In the United States, melphalan hydrochloride for injection will be included as part of the system, if approved. In Europe, the system is sold separately and used in conjunction with melphalan hydrochloride commercially available from a third party. In our clinical trials, melphalan hydrochloride for injection is provided to both European and United States clinical trial sites.
 Early development of HEPZATO System—FDA Complete Response Letter 
 Based on clinical trials conducted using an earlier version of our HEPZATO system, in August 2012 we submitted an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, seeking FDA approval for use of our HEPZATO system for the percutaneous intra-arterial administration of melphalan hydrochloride for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma in the liver and, subsequently, amended the application to ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver. 
 In the Spring of 2013, an Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee, or ODAC panel, convened by the FDA voted 16 to 0, with no abstentions, that the benefits of treatment with the early version of HEPZATO did not outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. A significant portion of FDA’s presentation to the ODAC panel was focused on the FDA’s assessment of treatment related risks, including the analysis of treatment-related deaths that occurred during clinical trials. The FDA also expressed concerns about hypotension, or low blood pressure, during the procedure, length of hospital stay, as well as risks of stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and bone marrow suppression. 
 5

In September 2013, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL, relating to our NDA. The FDA issues a CRL after the review of an NDA has been completed and questions remain that preclude approval of the NDA in its current form. The deficiencies identified by FDA in the CRL included a statement that we had to perform additional “well-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of HEPZATO using overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure,” and which “demonstrates that the clinical benefits of HEPZATO outweigh its risks.” The FDA also required that the additional clinical trial(s) be conducted using the product we intended to market, and that certain clinical, clinical pharmacology, human factors and product quality elements be addressed. 
 In January 2016, we entered into a Special Protocol Assessment agreement, or SPA, with the FDA on the design of a new Phase 3 clinical trial of HEPZATO to treat patients with hepatic dominant ocular melanoma. This SPA represented an agreement with FDA that a specific Phase 3 trial would adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the submission for regulatory approval of HEPZATO. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall response rate and quality-of-life measures. In the summer of 2018, we amended the protocol for the trial which, after much discussion regarding improvement of the enrollment rate with FDA, resulted in the trial protocol design becoming a non-randomized, single-arm study with a different primary endpoint (objective response rate), which effectively terminated the SPA. 
 We believe that the protocol amendments and other procedure refinements instituted during clinical trials and subsequently in commercial treatment usage in Europe, including changes to the way blood pressure is managed and monitored, may help address these procedure related risks. Collection of adequate safety data on all aspects of the procedure is a major focus of the clinical trials in our current clinical development program. 
 Procedure and Product Refinements 
 In 2012, we introduced the Generation Two version of the CHEMOSAT system, which offered improved hemofiltration and other device component product enhancements. Reports from treating physicians in both Europe and the United States using the Generation Two CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO have indicated that these product improvements and procedure refinements have improved the safety profile of our product. Since 2017, physicians in Europe and the United States have presented and published the results of research that indicated an improved safety profile by decreasing the percentage of adverse events experienced by treated patients, as well as efficacy in multiple tumor types. Collection of adequate safety data on all aspects of the procedure is a major focus of our clinical trials. 
Clinical Development Program 
 The focus of our clinical development program is to generate clinical data for CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO in various disease states to demonstrate efficacy and validate the safety profile of the current version of the product and treatment procedure. We believe that the improvements we have made to CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO and to the PHP therapy have addressed the adverse event profile and procedure-related risks that led to the issuance of the CRL. Our clinical development program is also designed to support clinical adoption of and reimbursement for CHEMOSAT in Europe, and to support regulatory approvals and reimbursement in various jurisdictions, including the United States. 
The FOCUS Trial 
 In July 2018, we commenced an amended clinical trial of HEPZATO, titled A Single-arm, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of HEPZATO Treatment in Patients with Hepatic-Dominant Ocular Melanoma, or the FOCUS Trial. The rarity of ocular melanoma, absence of crossover to the experimental trial arm, competing clinical trials and the commercial availability of PHP® Therapy in Europe impeded enrollment in the original randomized protocol. Under the revised study protocol, the FOCUS Trial was to include a minimum of 80 treated patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver. The primary endpoint of the FOCUS Trial is objective response rate, or ORR as measured by RECISTv1.1. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival. Additional exploratory outcome measures include time to objective response, hepatic progression-free survival, hepatic objective response, and quality of life, safety, and other pharmacokinetic measures. Patients previously enrolled in the HEPZATO arm of the original trial will continue to be treated and statistically evaluated as part of the revised FOCUS Trial. The FOCUS Trial is being conducted at approximately 30 sites in the United States and Europe. 
 During much of 2019, enrollment of patients in the trial, entry of data into the clinical trial database and the pace at which we monitored data at our clinical trial was adversely affected by a lack of capital to fund the trial.  While the funding constraints were alleviated in mid-2019, starting in early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic further impacted our ability to enroll and treat patients in this trial and to monitor data at our clinical trial sites. Enrollment of the final patient occurred on October 2, 2020. On March 31, 2021 we released a preliminary analysis of the FOCUS trial data based on 87% of enrolled patients using prespecified analyses. An Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 29.2% [95% CI: 20.1, 39.8] in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population which exceeded the predefined success criteria (21%) for the primary ORR endpoint. Evaluable patients in the HEPZATO arm had a statistically significant improvement over Best Alternative Care (BAC) in the following prespecified endpoints: 
 6

 
o | ORR of 32.9% [95% CI: 22.8, 44.4] versus 13.8% [CI: 3.9, 31.7] for the BAC arm (Chi-square P<0.05).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) of 9.0 months [95% CI: 6.2, 11.8] versus 3.1 months ([95% CI: 2.7, 5.7] for the BAC arm (HR=0.41 p<0.001).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Disease Control Rate of 70.9% [95% CI: 59.6, 80.6] versus 37.9% [95% CI: 20.7, 57.7] for patients in the BAC arm (p<0.002).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Duration of response and overall survival were not yet evaluable. Since not all patients were evaluable for all time points, these preliminary analyses may change as data matures.
 While it is difficult to precisely predict the pace of complete data analysis due to our reliance on clinical sites which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we currently expect to submit the NDA in early 2022. Once our clinical trial sites are able to return to normal operating procedures, we will reassess the impact and update our expected timing accordingly. 
 The ALIGN Trial 
 In April 2018 we initiated a pivotal trial of HEPZATO in patients with ICC, titled A Randomized, Controlled Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of HEPZATO Treatment Given Sequentially Following Cisplatin/Gemcitabine versus Cisplatin/Gemcitabine (Standard of Care) in Patients with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma, or the ALIGN Trial. Although, the first patient was enrolled in the ALIGN Trial in October 2018, we have experienced difficulties enrolling trial subjects under the existing trial protocol because patients that have received standard of care treatment outside of the trial are excluded.  Presently, we have paused our work on the ALIGN trial while we reevaluate the trial design and are focusing our efforts on the FOCUS trial conclusion and subsequent NDA filing. 
 We are currently reviewing the incidence, unmet need, available efficacy data and development requirements for a broad set of liver cancers in order to select a portfolio of follow-on indications which will maximize the value of the HEPZATO platform. Whether we continue the ALIGN trial will be dependent on the relative value of the ICC indication versus other alternative indications. 
 European Clinical Data Generation 
 In April 2015, we created a prospective patient registry in Europe to collect uniform essential patient safety, efficacy, and QoL information using observational study methods. Due to resource constraints fewer than 22 patients had been entered into the registry by the end of 2020.  Starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 additional resources were applied to increase the number of patients entered the registry.  This registry is intended to gather data in multiple tumor types from commercial cases performed by participating cancer centers in Europe. Registry data is considered to be supportive data and, as such, cannot be used for either registration approval, promotional or competitive claims. However, we believe the patient registry will provide a valuable supportive data repository that contains real-world evidence, from a commercial setting, that can be used to identify further clinical development opportunities, support clinical adoption and reimbursement in Europe.  In addition, we also provide support for a number of IITs.
Recent Data Presentations 
 In September 2020 results from a single-institution retrospective study conducted by Asklepios Hospital Barmbek of Hamburg in Germany on the use of the CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System to treat patients with metastatic ocular melanoma with liver metastases were published in the journal Radiology Research and Practice. 
 The study titled Unresectable Hepatic Metastasis of Uveal Melanoma: Hepatic Chemo saturation with High-Dose Melphalan-Long-Term Overall Survival Negatively Correlates with Tumor Burden, by Prof. Roland Bruning, et al, evaluated the safety and efficacy of PHP therapy in 19 patients with unresectable liver metastases from ocular melanoma treated with CHEMOSAT in the last-line setting. 
 Average time from diagnosis of liver metastasis to first PHP was 10.6 months (324 days). The 19 patients underwent a total of 43 PHP treatments. The median number of treatments per patient was 2. Tumor response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and adverse events  were evaluated using Common Criteria for Adverse Events. 
 Results of the study in the 19 evaluable patients showed that 10 patients (53%) had a partial response, 9 patients (47%) had stable disease, and no patients (0%) had progressive disease for a disease control rate of 100%. Median progression free survival (PFS) after the first treatment was 14.0 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.7 months. Survival rate estimates that were noted were 1-yr from first PHP treatment: 79.3%, 2-yrs from first PHP treatment: 60.4%, 5-yrs from first PHP treatment: 21.3%.
 7

Safety analysis showed that in the 43 procedures that were conducted, there were 6 Grade 1 events, 1 Grade 2 event, 2 Grade 3a events including coronary ischemia, 1 Grade 3b event including transfemoral bleeding following surgery, and 0 Grade 4 and Grade 5 events. Investigators stated that hematological events were observed most profoundly in platelet count, frequently improving in 5-7 days.
 Investigators concluded that for patients with non-resectable liver metastasis of uveal melanoma, treatment with PHP provides a safe and locally efficient liver directed procedure that offers patients a chance for long term survival.
 In November 2020 results from a single-institution retrospective study conducted by Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa Florida on the use of the Hepatic Delivery System to treat patients with liver metastases were published in the journal Cancer Control. 
 The study titled Over 12 Years Single Institutional Experience Performing Percutaneous Hepatic Perfusion for Unresectable Liver Metastases, by Michael J. Carr, et al, evaluated the safety and efficacy of PHP therapy in 31 patients with unresectable liver metastases from varying primary tumors.  
 The authors of this article describe their institutional experience of performing PHP procedures from 2008-2020. Overall, 107 PHP procedures were attempted among 31 patients; primary diseases were uveal melanoma (n=24), cutaneous melanoma (n=3), melanoma of unknown primary (n=1), and sarcoma (n=3). 105 (95%) procedures were completed successfully. There were no procedure-related mortalities, and AEs were expected and treated in the outpatient setting. The median number of procedures per patient was 3 (range: 1-6). 
 The authors provide specific details of their methods and practices while conducting the PHP procedure at their institution. Their procedural review noted that the patient is typically discharged on the first day after the procedure and is scheduled for an outpatient visit 3-4 days later. Bone marrow suppression is the most commonly observed adverse event. All patients experience some degree of low-grade bone marrow suppression which is managed in the outpatient setting. 
 In conclusion the authors stated that PHP is a safe treatment modality for isolated hepatic metastases which obviates the need for morbid laparotomy-based liver perfusions and can be repeated in patients who derive hepatic control of disease. 
 Market Access and Commercial Clinical Adoption 
 Europe 
 Our European marketing activities includ
e establishing strategic alliances with partners that include license, supply, sales and marketing arrangements. In December 2018, we entered into a 
license agreement, 
or the medac License, with medac GmbH, or medac, for the commercialization of CHEMOSAT i
n Europe. The 
medac License provides to 
medac the exclusive right to market and sell 
CHEMOSAT in all member states of the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The 
medac License provides to Delcath a combination of upfront and success-based milestone payments as well as a fixed transfer price per unit of CHEMOSAT and specified royalties. 
 Since launching CHEMOSAT in Europe, over 1,000 commercial treatments have been performed at over 25 European cancer centers. Physicians in Europe have used CHEMOSAT to treat patients with a variety of cancers in the liver, primarily ocular melanoma liver metastases, and other tumor types, including cutaneous melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and liver metastases from colorectal cancer, breast, pancreatic and neuroendocrine. 
 European Reimbursement 
 A critical driver of utilization growth for CHEMOSAT in Europe is the expansion of reimbursement mechanisms for the procedure in our priority markets. In most European countries, the government provides healthcare and controls reimbursement levels. Since the EU has no jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in its member states, the methodologies for determining reimbursement rates and the actual rates may vary by country.  Reimbursement is administered on a regional and national basis. Medical devices are typically reimbursed under Diagnosis Related Groups, or DRG, as part of a procedure. Prior to obtaining permanent DRG reimbursement codes, in certain jurisdictions, we are actively seeking interim reimbursement from existing mechanisms that include specific interim reimbursement schemes, new technology payment programs as well as existing DRG codes. Currently we have an interim level of reimbursement in Germany.
Th
e release of results from the FOCUS trial will create the opportunity to apply for National Level reimbursement in each European 
country in regard to 
metastatic Ocular Melanoma (mOM). These applications must 
be made by us on a country-by-country level basis, with priority placed on markets where CHEMOSAT is currently used. The results from this trial should also support existing 
 8

reimbursement mechanisms, such as Germany, allowing more hospital centers to secure funding to utilize CHEMOSAT. This increased level of evidence will ultimately support securing full funding for the treatment under DRG codes.
 Under the terms of the medac License, medac is required to provide support for reimbursement applications in the European markets covered by our agreement. CHEMOSAT is approved for reimbursement in the United Kingdom and Germany. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and the FDA. Foreign regulatory agencies, the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, storage, and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory agency or FDA requirements may result in Warning Letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension, or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. 
United States Regulatory Environment 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. HEPZATO is subject to regulation as a combination product, which means it is composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would therefore be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of its primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of HEPZATO, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has primary jurisdiction over its pre-market development and review. 
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated periodically, but at least annually;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. Similar requirements to the United States IND are required in the EU and other jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials.

Clinical Trials 
 For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1 Clinical Trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 Clinical Trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 Clinical Trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 Clinical Trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sponsors of clinical trials may submit proposals for the design, execution, and analysis for their pivotal trials under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement that the Phase 3 trial protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the drug product candidate with respect to effectiveness for the indication studied. Under a SPA, the FDA agrees to not later alter its position with respect to adequacy of the design, execution or analyses of the clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA, without the sponsor’s agreement, unless the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug after testing begins. 
 New Drug Applications 
 The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing, and control information. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which may be waived in certain circumstances. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. For new oncology products, the FDA will often solicit an opinion from an Oncology Drug Advisory Committee, a panel of expert authorities knowledgeable in the fields of general oncology, pediatric oncology, hematologic oncology, immunologic oncology, biostatistics, and other related professions. The ODAC panel reviews and evaluates data concerning the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drug products for use in the treatment of cancer and makes appropriate recommendations to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may be contingent on a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, that limits the labeling, distribution, or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 There are three primary regulatory pathways for a New Drug Application under Section 505 of the FDCA: Section 505 (b)(1), Section 505 (b)(2) and Section 505(j). A Section 505 (b)(1) application is used for approval of a new drug (for clinical use) whose active ingredients have not been previously approved. A Section 505 (b)(2) application is used for a new drug that relies on data not developed by the applicant. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This statutory provision permits the approval of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits the applicant to rely in part upon the FDA’s findings 
 10

of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products. Section 505(j) application, also known as an abbreviated NDA, is used for a generic version of a drug that has already been approved. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity 
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The orphan designation is granted for a combination of a drug entity and an indication and therefore it can be granted for an existing drug with a new (orphan) indication. Applications are made to the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA and a decision or request for more information is rendered in 60 days. NDAs for designated orphan drugs are exempt from user fees, obtain additional clinical protocol assistance, are eligible for tax credits up to 50% of research and development costs, and are granted a seven-year period of exclusivity upon approval. The FDA cannot approve the same drug for the same condition during this period of exclusivity, except in certain circumstances where a new product demonstrates superiority to the original treatment. Exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug, and an orphan designation does not limit the use of that drug in other applications outside the approved designation in either a commercial or investigational setting. 
 We have received five  orphan drug designations for melphalan in the following indications:
  
• | the treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of patients with ocular melanoma; 
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer, or HCC; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, which includes ICC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
We have received one orphan drug designation for doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer, or HCC.  
 The granting of orphan drug designations does not mean that the FDA has approved a new drug. Companies must still pursue the rigorous development and approval process that requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product will be granted at all, or on a timely basis. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be report
ed to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies an
d are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon drug manufacturers.  Following
 such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters that could require the drug manufacturer to modify certain activities. A Form 483 Notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions
 the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidelines. In addition to Form 483 Notices and Untitled Letters or Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a drug manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may require us to recall our products from distribution or withdraw any potential approvals of an NDA for that product. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label inf
ormation, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, any drug mod
ifications, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to the FDA for its 
approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the development of 
additional data or the 
conduct of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, Warning Letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. 
 Physicians may prescribe legally available prod
ucts for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those that have been 
tested by the drug manufacturer and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, in particular in oncology. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied 
 11

circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. 
 European Regulatory Environment 
 In the EU, the CHEMOSAT system is subject to regulation as a medical device. The EU is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Under the EU Medical Devices Directive (Directive No 93/42/ECC of 14 June 1993, as last amended), drug delivery products such as the CHEMOSAT system is governed by the EU laws on pharmaceutical products only if they are (i) placed on the market in such a way that the device and the pharmaceutical product form a single integral unit which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination, and (ii) the product is not reusable. In such cases, the drug delivery product is governed by the EU Code on Medicinal Products for Human Use (Directive 2001/83/EC, as last amended), while the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive apply to the safety and performance-related device features of the product. Because we do not intend to place the CHEMOSAT system on the EU market as a single integral unit with melphalan, the product is governed solely by the EU Medical Devices Directive, while the separately marketed drug is governed by the EU Code relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use and other EU legislation applicable to drugs for human use. 
 Before we may commercialize a medical device in the EU, we must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles a manufacturer to affix a CE conformity mark, without which the products cannot be commercialized in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. In April 2011, we obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation One CHEMOSAT system and began European commercialization with this version of the CHEMOSAT system in early 2012. In April 2012, the Company obtained authorization to affix a CE Mark for the Generation Two CHEMOSAT system, and since this time all procedures in Europe have been performed with this version of the system. 
 The Medical Devices Directive establishes a classification system placing devices into Class I, IIa, IIb, or III, depending on the risks and characteristics of the medical device. For certain types of low-risk medical devices (i.e., Class I devices which are non-sterile and do not have a measuring function), the manufacturer may issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives. Other devices are subject to a conformity assessment procedure requiring the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a Member State of the EU to conduct conformity assessments. 
 CHEMOSAT is regulated as a Class IIb medical device. As a Class IIb medical device, the Notified Body is not required to carry out an examination of the product’s design dossier as part of its conformity assessment prior to commercialization. The Company must continue to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Directive 93/42 EC) and is subject to a conformity assessment procedure requiring the intervention of a Notified Body. The conformity assessment procedure for Class IIb medical devices requires the manufacturer to apply for the assessment of its quality system for the design, manufacture and inspection of its medical devices by a Notified Body. The Notified Body will audit the system to determine whether it conforms to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive. If the Notified Body’s assessment is favorable, it will issue a Full Quality Assurance Certificate, which enables the manufacturer to draw a Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the medical devices covered by the assessment. Thereafter, the Notified Body will carry out periodic audits to ensure that the approved quality system is applied by the manufacturer. 
 A manufacturer without a registered place of business in a Member State of the EU which places a medical device on the market under its own name must designate an authorized representative established in the
 EU who can act before, and be addressed by, the Competent Authorities on the manufacturer’s behalf with regard to the manufacturer’s obligations under the EU Medical Devices Directive. Delcath Systems Ltd. located in Galway, Ireland, serves as the authorized representative of the Company. 
 In the EU, we must also comply with the Medical Device Vigilance System, which is designed to improve the protection of health and safety of patients, users, and others by reducing the likelihood of recurrence of incidents related to the use of a medical device. Under this system, incidents are defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, user or other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. When a medical device is suspected to be a contributory cause of an incident, its manufacturer or authorized representative in the EU must report it to the Competent Authority of the Member State where the incident occurred. Incidents are generally investigated by the manufacturer. The manufacturer’s investigation is monitored by the Competent Authority, which may intervene, or initiate an independent investigation if considered appropriate. An investigation may conclude in the adoption of a Field Safety Corrective Action, or FSCA. An FSCA is an action taken by a manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An FSCA may include device recall, modification exchange and destruction. 
 12

The manufacturer or its authorized representative must notify its customers and/or the end users of the medical device of the FSCA via a Field Safety Notice. 
 
In the EU, the off-label promotion of a pharmaceutical product is strictly prohibited under the EU Community Code on Medicinal Products, which provides that all information provided within the context of the promotion of a drug must comply with the information contained in its approved summary of product characteristics. Our product instructions and indication reference the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan hydrochloride. However, no melphalan labels in the EU reference our product, and the labels vary from country to country with respect to the approved indication of the drug and its mode of administration. In the exercise of their professional judgment in the practice of medicine, physicians are generally allowed, under certain conditions, to use or prescribe a product in ways not approved by regulatory authorities. Physicians intending to use our device must obtain melphalan separately for use with the CHEMOSAT system and must use melphalan independently at their discretion. 
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU Member States laws implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals. 
 Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the Medical Devices Directive, with the EU and EU Member State laws on the promotion of medicinal products or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. 
 The European Commission recently reviewed the Medical Device Directive legislative framework and promulgated REGULATION (EU) 2017/745 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. This new Medical Device Regulation became effective on May 25, 2017, marking the start of a 3-year transition period for manufacturers selling medical device in Europe to comply with the new medical device regulation, or MDR, which governs all fa
cets of medical devices. The transition task is highly complex and touches every aspect of product development, manufacturing production, distribution and post marketing evaluation. Due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, on 17 April 2020, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal to postpone the implementation of the MDR (EU) 2017/745 by 12 months. This urgently drafted proposal to delay the MDR is in response to the exceptional circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemi
c and the potential impact it may have had on the MDR implementation. The new Date of Application (DoA) for the MDR will be May 
26, 2021.
 Effectively addressing these changes will require a complete review of our device operations to determine what is necessary to comply. We do not believe the MDR regulatory changes will impact our business at this time, though implementation of the medical device legislation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or restrict our operations. 
 Other International Regulations 
 We continue to evaluate commercial opportunities in select markets when resources are available and at an appropriate time. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and trademarks, maintain trade secret and know-how protection, enforce our proprietary rights against infringers, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Because of the length of time and expense associated with developing new products and bringing them through the regulatory approval process, the health care industry places considerable emphasis on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for new technologies, products, processes, know-how, and methods. We hold rights in eight U.S. utility patents, one U.S. design patent, three pending U.S. utility patent applications, five issued foreign counterpart utility patents (including the validations of European Patents with claims directed to our filter and frame apparatus in nineteen European countries, a European patent with claims directed to our filter apparatus and media in nine countries, and a European patent with claims to a kit of parts, directed to CHEMOSAT®, in eighteen countries), six issued 
foreign counterpart design patents, and three pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Patents directed to our chemotherapy filtration system “Apparatus for Removing Chemotherapy Compounds from Blood” were issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in July 2017, October 2018, August 2019, and February 2020. The patent issued in August 2019 has claims to a kit of parts capable of being assembled for delivering a small molecule chemotherapeutic agent to a subject. These claims are directed to HEPZATO™ KIT. The patent that issued in February 2020 has claims directed to our methods of treatment. In February 2019, a patent was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office with claims directed to a method of using our filter and frame apparatus. A Hong Kong patent directed to our Filter and Frame Apparatus was issued in March 2018. A European patent was granted by the European Patent Office for our chemotherapy filtration apparatus in December 2018 and in July 
 13

2019 a European patent was granted by the European Patent Office with claims to a kit of parts, directed to CHEMOSAT®.  A European patent directed to a method of using our filter and frame apparatus was granted in April 2019 by the European Patent Office. In August 2019, a European patent was granted by the European Patent Office with claims directed to our filter and frame apparatus and validated in eleven countries to provide additional European patent coverage for our filter and frame apparatus to the European patent directed to the frame apparatus that was granted in April 2017. When appropriate, we actively pursue protection of our proprietary products, technologies, processes, and methods by filing United States and international patent and trademark applications. We seek to pursue additional patent protection for technology invented through research and development, manufacturing, and clinical use of CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO that will enable us to expand our patent portfolio around advances to our current systems, technology, and methods for our current applications as well as beyond the treatment of cancers in the liver. 
 There can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage. 
 To maintain our proprietary position, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technological experience to protect proprietary manufacturing processes, technology, and know-how relating to our business. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. In addition, we also seek to maintain our trade secrets through maintenance of the physical security of the premises where our trade secrets are located. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. 
 In certain circumstances, United States patent law allows for the extension of a patent’s duration for a period of up to five years after FDA approval. We intend to seek extension for one of our patents after FDA approval if it has not expired prior to the date of approval. In addition to our proprietary protections, the FDA has granted us six orphan drug designations that provide us a seven-year period of exclusive marketing beginning on the date that our NDA is approved by the FDA for the designated orphan drug. While the exclusivity only applies to the indication for which the drug has been approved, we believe that this exclusivity will provide us with added protection once commercialization of an orphan drug designated product begins. 
 There has been and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and medical device areas. If a third party asserts a claim against us, we may be forced to expend significant time and money defending such actions and an adverse determination in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to redesign our product, require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if licenses are not available
, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using our product.  Additionally, we plan to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets or know-how. Patent litigation can be costly and time consuming and there can be no assurance that the outcome will be favorable to us.
 Competition 
 The healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research, rapid technological progress and significant competition from numerous healthcare companies and academic institutions. Competition in the cancer treatment industry is intense. We believe that the primary competitive factors for products addressing cancer include safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, price, and patient’s quality of life. We also believe that physician relationships, especially relationships with leaders in the medical and surgical oncology communities, are important competitive factors. We also believe that the current global economic conditions and new healthcare reforms could put competitive pressure on us, including reduced selling prices and potential reimbursement rates, and overall procedure rates. Certain markets in Europe are experiencing the effects of continued economic weakness, which is affecting healthcare budgets and reimbursement. 
 CHEMOSAT competes and, if approved by the FDA, HEPZATO KITTM will compete with all forms of liver cancer treatments, including surgery, systemic chemotherapy, focal therapies, and palliative care. In the disease states we are targeting there are also numerous clinical trials sponsored by third parties, which can compete for potential patients in the near term and may ultimately lead to new competitive therapies. 
 For ocular melanoma liver metastases, there are currently no approved or effective treatment options, and patients are generally treated with a variety of local and regional techniques. There are numerous companies developing and marketing devices for the performance of focal therapies, including Boston Scientific Corporation, the Covidien Products division of Medtronic plc, Merit Medical Systems, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Sirtex Medical Limited, AngioDynamics, Inc., and many others. 
 Gemcitabine plus cisplatin remains the standard of care for the treatment of ICC in patients who are not candidates for surgery. 
 14

Several therapies have been recently approved for unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, which may encompass liver metastases. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar™, GlaxoSmithKline plc), is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation and in combination with trametinib in unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Furthermore, trametinib (MEKINIST™, GlaxoSmithKline plc) is indicated as single agent (in addition to in combination with dabrafinib) for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Previously approved melanoma therapies such as the biologic ipilimumab (Yervoy™, Bristol Myers Squibb Company) and the B-RAF targeted drug vemurafenib (Zelboraf™, Genentech, Inc.) may also make up the competitive landscape for the treatment of metastatic liver disease. 
 Many of these treatments are approved in Europe and other global markets. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing, and personnel resources. In addition, some of our competitors have considerable experience in conducting clinical trials, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities. Our competitors may develop alternative treatment methods, or achieve earlier product development, in which case the likelihood of us achieving meaningful revenues or profitability will be substantially reduced.
 Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 We manufacture certain critical medical device components, 
including our proprietary filter media, and assemble and package CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO at our facility in Queensbury, New York.  Our European headquarters and distribution facility in Galway, Ireland  conducts final manufacturing, processing, and assembly. We use third parties to manufacture some components of CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO. CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO and its components must be manufactured and sterilized in accordance with approved manufacturing and pre-determined performance specifications. In addition, certain components will require sterilization prior to distribution, and we use third-party vendors to perform the sterilization process. 
 We are required to comply with the FDA’s cGMP regulations and international quality system regulations including those established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) with respect to products sold in the EU. We are required to maintain ISO 13485 certification for medical devices to be sold in the EU, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. Our facilities are ISO 13485:2016 certified. 
 Human Capital Management
 As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 36 
full time employees , of which 31 are 
located in the United States and 5 are located in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order
 to motivate 
such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives
 and lead to 
the success of the Company and  increase value to our stockholders.
 We value diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in our workforce and our p
olicy is that we do not discriminate based on race, religion, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, mil
itary and veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic as established by federal, state or local laws. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed our employees to work 
remotely where needed and if practicable to ensure the health and safety of our team members.
