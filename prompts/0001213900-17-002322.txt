Strategy and Focus Areas
 
Our customers use touch and gesture enabling technology to grow their businesses, drive efficiencies, and gain competitive advantages. In this interactive world, cost effective and robust touch and gesture technology is a strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across an expanding number of products. We understand how touch and gesture features can help deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve and our strategy is to deliver proven technology so our customers can bring products to market that provide an optimal user experience.
 
Over the past year, we added a new business unit to design, manufacture and sell embedded sensors to our business-to-business customers who integrate them into their products. We previously only offered licensed touch technology designs. An important piece of our new strategy has been the development of an automated manufacturing and production system that now is in full operation. Our ability to manufacture fully integrated sensor modules reduce our customers’ time to market while providing us a path to further growth.
 
Over the past year, we also have added a new business unit to design, manufacture and sell our own branded consumer electronics products. AirBar is our first consumer product.
 
Our goal is to continue to be a leader in touch technology while transitioning current licensing customers into our embedded sensors and expanding to new markets where touch and gesture interface provides a competitive advantage. We intend to continue innovating through the introduction of next-generation products that offer better price and performance and architectural advantages compared to our competitors. We intend to execute on this strategy through portfolio transformation, internal innovation, and co-development of products with our customers and the building of strategic partnerships.
 
Business Model
 
We derive revenues through technology licensing and selling embedded sensors and consumer products. We operate in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets.
 
Licensing 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had forty-one technology license agreements with global OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. Our licensing customer base is primarily in the automotive, printer, specialized tablet and e-reader markets. Sixteen of our licensing customers are currently shipping products that embed our touch and gesture technology. We anticipate other customers will initiate product shipments throughout 2017 and in future years as they complete final product development and release cycles. Customer product development and release cycles typically take between 6 months to 36 months. We earn our license fees on a per unit basis when our customers ship products using our technology.

-

 

We also offer engineering consulting services to our licensing customers on a flat rate or hourly rate basis. Typically, our customers require engineering support during the development and initial manufacturing phase for their products using our technology.
 
In late 2016, we stopped entering into new license agreements with customers. However, we anticipate continuing to earn license fees from our current license customers. Our plan is to transition current customers with license agreements to purchase agreements using our sensor modules. This conversion process is expected to take several years.
 
Sensor Module 
 
In 2015, we completed development on zForce AIR. This optical interactive touch and gesture enabling technology led to the development of a series of standardized sensors that provide our customers with an easy to install touch and gesture enabling solution in a senor hardware module.
 
During 2016, we invested in developing a new robotic manufacturing process designed specifically for zForce AIR module optical sensing technology and in the last quarter of 2016 we started mass production of our first sensor modules.  Industry specific standardized sensor modules using a common technology platform will allow us to enter and compete in numerous markets without being encumbered with the project specific custom design solutions of our licensing business.
 
We currently have signed development agreements with customers in the automotive market to embed our sensor modules in steering wheels and entry system products. We expect the integration of our sensor modules will continue to gain momentum as we expand our product offerings. Over time, we expect the majority of our revenue to be derived from the sale of sensor modules.
 
Consumer Products
 
In 2016, we developed our first consumer product, AirBar. As a plug and play accessory, AirBar enables touch and gesture functionality for notebook computers. AirBar is powered by one of our sensor modules.
 
We produce the sensor modules for AirBar at our manufacturing facility in Sweden. Salutica Allied Solutions (“Salutica”) in Malaysia provides the final product assembly, packaging and distribution fulfillment for AirBar.
 
Our strategy has been to focus production of AirBar on Windows-based 15.6 inch display notebook PCs, which is the largest addressable market for non-touch computers. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we started mass production of the 15.6 inch version of AirBar and began initial shipments to customers in the United States and Europe. We also are rolling out AirBar versions for 13.3 inch and 14 inch Windows-based notebook PCs and a version for the 13.3 inch Apple MacBook Air. Our plan is to continue to expand our AirBar portfolio to include additional sizes and devices.
 
Markets
 
Automotive
 
The automobile is the latest frontier using interactive and sensing technology to interact with the driver, passengers and other vehicles. The market for sensing technology is growing every year as vehicles become more complex and display sizes become larger and curved. Touch and gesture interface and sensing applications are becoming standard equipment in all vehicles.
 
In 2016, our fourteen automotive OEM customers had a total of thirty-six automobile models using our touch technology in their infotainment systems. The majority of these automobiles are sold in China and include SUVs (Boojun 560 and Haval H6) and two top-selling sedans (Chevrolet Cruze and Buick Excelle). In the fourth quarter of 2014, Volvo launched their new XC90 incorporating a 9.7 inch display using our touch technology. Our touch technology is also deployed in Volvo models launched in 2016, the S90 and V90. The Volvo V90 Cross Country launched in early 2017 is also equipped with our touch technology. The Volvo XC90 and S90 infotainment systems have received awards citing properties such as responsiveness and gloved operation.

We believe that our new sensor modules are positioned to make further inroads in the global automotive market by offering simple and easy integration and ultimately providing brighter, more readable displays, with a full operating temperature range that are easily usable while wearing gloves. 
 
We are currently actively engaged with automotive OEM and Tier 1 suppliers to the automotive market in the development of the following:
 

● | Our zForce DRIVE sensor technology enables high fidelity detection of hands and fingers positions on the steering wheel. This helps create a safer and more natural interaction with the automobile’s systems and the driver’s smart phone to decrease driver distraction. In 2015, we entered into an agreement with Autoliv Development AB, a leading supplier of safety products for the automotive industry, to explore and industrialize our zForce technology for the steering wheel. Self and assisted driving cars with zForce DRIVE sensors have been publicly displayed at CES 2016 and 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our zForce AIR technology is being deployed in door handles and other exterior parts of the automobile to enable keyless entry and automation of door functions. 

 
In June 2016, we entered into a joint venture with a Swedish based eye-tracking company SMART EYE AB. By combining our technologies, we plan to bring multi-chip modules to the market for the consumer and automotive markets.
 
Consumer Electronics
 
Printers and Office Equipment
 
Photo printers and printers combining printer/scanner/fax functions typically require feature-rich menus and settings to deliver an optimal user experience, and printer OEMs are increasingly replacing mechanical buttons and old style basic resistive touch displays with higher performance touch interactive displays. We have signed license agreements with five of the leading global printers and office equipment OEMs including Hewlett Packard (“HP”) and Samsung. HP started shipping the first consumer printer with our touch technology integrated in early 2014 and today many of their printer models with interactive displays are using our technology. Samsung and other major customers started shipping printers with our technology in late 2016 and in the first quarter 2017. During 2016, our customers shipped 8.8 million printers. HP has cumulatively shipped over 16 million printers using our touch technology since their first models started shipping in mid-2014.
 
Over the next few years, we expect our printer customers to transition from licensing our touch technology to purchasing and embedding our new sensor modules as new printers are designed and deployed.
 
E-Readers and Tablets
 
Our touch technology is widely used in e-readers. Since 2011, over 26 million e-readers and tablets have been shipped containing our touch technology by customers such as Amazon, Kobo, Deutsche Telekom, Barnes & Noble and Sony. During 2016, our customers shipped more than 2.7 million e-readers and tablets.

In 2016, we began working with e-reader customers on a new generation low cost touch sensor using our zForce AIR technology. In the first quarter of 2017, we received our first order for sensor modules to be embedded in a larger form factor e-reader that is expected to begin production mid-2017.
 
AirBar
 
Our first branded consumer product using our sensor modules is AirBar. AirBar is a plug and play USB connected touch sensor for Windows 8 and Windows 10 notebooks and currently supports 13.3, 14 and 15.6 inch displays. AirBar can also be used with certain Chromebooks. At CES in January 2016, we announced AirBar for 13.3 inch display MacBook Air.
 
In 2016, we signed distribution agreements with Ingram Micro, the world’s largest technology distribution company to provide inventory and logistical management for our consumer products. Our agreements cover distribution of our consumer products in the United States, Europe, Asia, and India. Ingram Micro provides inventory and fulfillment services for many of the largest global web-based and brick and mortar technology retailers. End-customers can buy AirBar from Amazon.com, Amazon in China, India, Mexico, Canada, Germany and the UK, Best Buy, NewEgg, and Walmart.
 
In the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate expanding the availability of AirBar with direct shipments to Ingram Micro in India to provide service to Flipkart.com and Amazon in India. Dell.com has informed us that it intends to start offering AirBar through its web stores in the United States before expanding to its web stores in Europe and India. We also expect begin shipments to JD.com in China.
 
We plan to implement a marketing plan to increase awareness and building the AirBar brand beginning in the second quarter of 2017.
 
Product Backlog
 
Our AirBar product backlog at March 10, 2017 was approximately $356,000. The product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 90 days to Ingram Micro. Our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules. Additionally, orders can be canceled without significant penalties. As a result of these factors, we do not believe that our product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period. 
Distribution, Sales and Marketing
 
Licensing
 
In our licensing business, we consider OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to be our primary customers. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers determine the design requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our user interface and touch technology in their products. The use and pricing of our user interface and touch technology are governed by a technology licensing agreement.

Our licensing agreements historically resulted from sales efforts by our senior management, design engineers, and sales personnel interacting with our potential customers’ decision-makers throughout the product development and order process. We stopped marketing and sales of licensing agreements in late 2016.
 
Sensor Modules and Consumer Products
 
In our sensor module business, we consider OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to be our primary customers. Our customers purchase a standardized sensor module that comes in different sizes with different interfaces. We produce the sensor modules in Sweden by our majority owned subsidiary, Pronode, in an automated manufacturing process. The sales of our sensors are governed by a product purchase agreement.
 
In our consumer products business, we manufacture the sensors for AirBar in Sweden by Pronode and the final assembly, packaging and distribution fulfillment is performed by Salutica. From the Salutica facility, AirBar is shipped to distributors such as Ingram Micro in various global locations. Our sales channel is primarily with key web retailers in each of our global markets such as Amazon.com, Amazon in China, India, Mexico, Canada, Germany and the UK, Best Buy, NewEgg, and Walmart.
 
Our sales force and marketing operations are managed out of our office in Stockholm, Sweden. Our current sales force is comprised of sales offices located in the United States, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Japan and Taiwan.
 
Our sales are normally negotiated and executed in U.S. Dollars.

Touch Technologies
 
Background
 
There are various technologies for touch and gesture sensing technology available in the market with differing profiles such as feature sets, power consumption, level of maturity, and cost:

● | Optical sensing technology uses light beams that reflected by an object to detect input. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Capacitive touch sensors typically use one or several layers of transparent conductive material applied to the inner structure of the LCD or on a glass or plastic layer in front on the LCD to sense activation.
● | Resistive touch sensors use conductive and resistive layers separated by thin space to sense activation. 
● | Acoustic pulse recognition sensors use piezoelectric transducers located at positions of a surface to alter the mechanical energy of a touch vibration into an electronic signal. 
● | Surface acoustic wave touch sensors use ultrasonic waves that pass over the screen for activation. 

Capacitive and Resistive Technology
 
The two dominant types of touch technologies available are capacitive and resistive. A capacitive sensor reacts to a conductive object by sensing the difference in capacitance between two areas on the sensor surface or between the finger and the ground. Capacitive touch sensors are suitable if the user has unimpeded contact between the finger and the screen. A resistive touch sensor is pressure-sensitive. Resistive touch sensors are suitable for detailed work and for selection of particular spot on a screen. Resistive technology is not suitable for sweeping gestures or motion, such as zooming in and out.
Optical Sensing Technology
 
Our optical technology works by projecting laser beams across a surface, through the air or any other detection area without any need for an extra physical layer to be added. It can be activated by using any object such as fingers, passive pens or thick gloves. Our optical sensing technology also can be designed for waterproof applications and can provide sensing functionality when fully submerged.
 
We believe our optical sensing technology has a number of key advantages over other touch sensing technologies:
 

● | It does not require additional layers that may dilute the image quality of the display or cause unwanted reflections and glare making reading the display difficult. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It is more responsive than capacitive sensing technology and, as a result, is quicker and less prone to misread. 
● | It requires no downward pressure on the activation surface in order to select or move items. 
● | It is cost-efficient due to the lower cost of materials and simple and high yield manufacturing process. 
● | It enables multiple methods of input, such as continuous tracking of multiple fingers, taps to hit keys, sweeps to zoom in or out, and gestures to write text or symbols directly on the touch surface.
● | It works in all environments and does not require any special properties from the object used.

Competition
 
The market for touch technology is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving standards and new product releases by our competitors.
 
We believe that implementation of resistive touch technologies in consumer devices is declining because of limitations in sweep gestures, limitations on industrial design, and the negative impact on screen clarity due to film overlays.
 
Neonode is one of few companies that offer optical sensing technology in high volume. Our major competition are companies offering projected capacitive (“PCAP”) technologies. PCAP is a prevalent standard in mobiles and tablets offering finger based touch and industrial design flexibility. PCAP has many suppliers competing to offer the same solution with price being a major differentiation point. OEMs regularly change PCAP suppliers in order to maintain the best pricing.
 
Our competitors, and the interface technology we believe they offer, include the following:
 

Company | Technology 
--------------------+---------------------------------------------
Synaptics | Capacitive; In-cell 
Cypress | Capacitive; In-cell 
Tyco Electronics | Capacitive; Resistive; Surface acoustic wave
Touch International | Resistive; Capacitive 

 
We believe that the only current competitor to our AirBar product for PC notebooks is PCAP touch solution embedded during the initial OEM manufacturing process. We do not believe that there are any competitors currently capable of adding plug and play touch screen functions comparable to AirBar for non-touch Windows 8 and Windows 10 notebooks.
 
Controller Chips
 
Our licensing customers must use our Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) controllers designed specifically for our optical sensing technology. Our sensor modules also utilize ASIC controller chips.
 
The NN1001, the first generation controller ASIC, was developed pursuant to an Analog Device Development Agreement between Neonode and Texas Instruments entered into on February 4, 2011 and effective as of January 24, 2010. The NN1001 began shipping to our licensing customers in 2012.
 
The NN1002, the second generation controller ASIC, was developed pursuant to an Analog Device Development Agreement between Neonode and Texas Instruments entered into on April 25, 2013 effective December 6, 2012. The NN1002 began shipping to our licensing customers in 2015.
 
The NN1003 is the third generation controller ASIC and was developed by ST Microelectronics. The NN1003 is designed for high speed sensing applications. The NN1003 began shipping in 2016 and is powering the sensor used in AirBar.
 
The NN1001, NN1002, and NN1003 controllers offer numerous design advantages:
 

● | The NN1001 and NN1002 have scanning speeds of 1000 Hz (latency down to 1ms). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The NN1002 supports advanced power management and enables touch detection even when the device is in sleep or off mode.
● | The NN1002 consumes less than 1mW at 100Hz. 
● | The NN1002 and NN1003 can be synchronized to touch enable larger areas by using multiple chips. 
● | The NN1002 and NN1003 support simultaneous scanning leading to higher speeds and reduced power consumption.
