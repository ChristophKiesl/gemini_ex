Description of Business
 
Zenosense, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 11, 2008.
 
Effective December 4, 2013, the Company entered into a development and exclusive license agreement (“License Agreement”) whereby the Company will provide a third party with capital for the development of sensory technology for a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus / Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA/SA”) detection device and a cancer detective device and other improvements and variations to the products (the “Sgenia Products”) to be used in the hospital and health care environments, in exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis. The License Agreement was modified in April 2015 and July 2015 to extend to additional cancer sensory products and to modify and extend the development schedule and change the research funding budget to accommodate the lung cancer product as well as MRSA/SA product.
 
On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement by way of a Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“MML SSA”) with a third party medical detection device developer (“Partner”) utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MIDS Medical Ltd (“MML”), a UK Limited company of which the Company owns a 40% interest awarded on July 1, 2016, in exchange for its participation and funding to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner’s MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology platform (“MIDS”). MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property (“MIDS IP”) during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party.
 
Following an extensive revision to the MIDS core Hall effect sensor electronics during the first half of 2018, MML reported, in June, 2018, that testing had confirmed and had materially improved upon the testing results announced in late 2017, with a near doubling of sensitivity of detection. MML informed the Company that two brands of commercially available paramagnetic assay beads were tested: GE Sera-Mag™ (3μm) and Thermo Fisher Scientific M-270 Dynabeads® (2.8 μm), both of which are thought suitable for a HS troponin assay and have similar paramagnetic characteristics. MML also stated that the MIDS level of detail of both these brands was seen on a reliable, repeatable basis at around 50,000 beads, with good signal linearity (required for accurate assay quantitation) at higher numbers. This number of beads detected at the level of detail is, according to MML, well within the range advised by MML’s assay consultants as suitable for a HS troponin assay.

On August 31, 2018, the Company and MML entered into an agreement with an investor for the funding of MML of up to US$1,200,000 in exchange for up to 10.31% equity ownership in MML. The Company’s ownership of MML may be diluted based on the amount of the investor funds.
 
The Company has been dormant since November, 2018.

Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation
 
As of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state-level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer provides part-time consulting services to us without compensation.
