Overview
 
We are a developer of highly advanced and proprietary precision hardware and software grow solutions for the indoor agriculture marketplace. We believe we are the only company with an automated and fully integrated grow solution in the indoor agriculture industry. We also believe our Agrify “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution is vastly differentiated from anything else on the market in that it combines our seamlessly integrated hardware and software offerings with a wide range of associated services such as consulting, engineering, and construction to form what we believe is the most complete solution available from a single provider. The totality of our product mix and service capabilities form an integrated ecosystem in what has historically been an extremely fragmented market for the various components needed for indoor agriculture. As a result, we believe we are well situated to create a dominant market position in the indoor agriculture sector.
 
Despite the fact that the indoor agriculture space is rapidly growing, our grower customers face some significant obstacles to their operations (such as lack of standard operating procedures, poor ventilation and air circulation, disease and pest mitigation and unutilized vertical space) that pose a serious threat to their long-term profitability. We believe that our turnkey, fully integrated Agrify “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution is the key to resolving many of the challenges our customers encounter. With years of indoor agriculture industry experience and extensive domain expertise, our team is able to work closely with cultivators across various commercial segments including fruits, vegetables, hemp and cannabis. While we do not cultivate, come in contact with, distribute or dispense cannabis or any cannabis derivatives that are currently prohibited under United States federal law, our cultivation solutions can be used within indoor grow facilities by cannabis cultivators. 
 
Not only do we provide our valued customers with the tangible benefit of working with a single provider in what has historically been a decentralized market full of piecemeal solutions that were not necessarily designed and engineered to work harmoniously with one another, we have also elevated the entire indoor growing experience. Through our cutting-edge grow solutions, we believe we give our customers the tools they need to operate their facilities with more precision, consistency and increased yields while helping them achieve higher returns on investments in equipment such as ours. Our goal is always to enable our customers to consistently produce the highest quality products at the lowest cost possible.
 
We have generated significant momentum in the U.S. market with our proprietary Agrify “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution, which is the result of extensive research and development, and we expect to have significant expansion opportunities over time both domestically and globally. We have set ourselves apart by bringing to market a technologically savvy, bundled solution of equipment, software and services that is turnkey, end-to-end, fully integrated and optimized for precision growing. As we continue to accelerate our growth, we have started taking pre-orders for the newest version of our flagship hardware product, version 3.5 of the Agrify Vertical Farming Unit (AVFU), as well as our proprietary Software as a Service (“SaaS”) product Agrify Insights™. SaaS (also known as subscribeware or rentware) is a software licensing and delivery model wherein software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.

The Agrify Vertical Farming Unit
 

Agrify Insights™
 
Our core business model includes substantial equipment sales for the AVFUs as well as recurring SaaS revenues for Agrify Insights™, as our software is licensed by customers through a subscription that allows us to charge monthly fees for its continued use. Additionally, we are able to drive even more revenue and new business through our service offerings and complementary products. All of our AVFU-related revenue has come from sales of the first three generations of our AVFU, which has substantially similar functionality as the AVFU version 3.5. We have also been selling LED lights, a small amount of environmental threat mitigation products from Bluezone Products, Inc. and Enozo Technologies, Inc. and other grow and ancillary equipment. As of December 31, 2020, our backlog, which consists of purchase orders or purchase commitments, was $58.6 million. We expect to recognize approximately $40 million from the backlog as revenue in 2021 and the rest gradually thereafter. As of December 31, 2020, we have $105 million of carefully vetted potential sales opportunities (which we refer to as our qualified pipeline). Of this, $78 million of qualified pipeline was generated through our company directly and $27 million through our Agrify-Valiant Joint-Venture. We are presently working to convert this pipeline into confirmed bookings over the next 12 months.

We place a heavy emphasis on the qualification process to ensure that all active opportunities in our qualified pipeline have been meticulously vetted. The resulting qualified pipeline is a byproduct of the due diligence investigation we conduct to get to know our potential customers. We believe our consultative sales process helps us ensure that our prospective buyers would significantly benefit from our solutions, and that they have all the means (or a concrete plan to acquire the means) necessary to make a purchasing decision within 12 months. Key vetting criteria in our due diligence analysis includes the potential customer’s financial resources, its ability to identify and secure a suitable facility site, and the likelihood it will be able to obtain all of the necessary local and state provisional licenses. Our qualified pipeline is intended to show only the opportunities that we expect to close within a 12-month period. All other opportunities are engaged in our sales funnel. Although we have a high level of confidence that our qualified pipeline will translate into bookings over the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such pursuits.
 
We target large scale high-value enterprise sales versus high-volume sales, and we believe that we will be able to significantly scale our business in the coming years without needing to significantly increase our headcount. During 2020 we unveiled new capabilities and partnerships around facility design, engineering, construction, and equipment financing. Ultimately, we are confident that our ability to support our customers with a full range of indoor grow solutions and services should position us to be the provider of choice in the market.
 
We also believe that the development of stronger business, operational and compliance practices across indoor agriculture in general is inevitable as the sector continues to evolve and mature, making our integrated, turnkey solution even more attractive to customers. We have witnessed first-hand that indoor agriculture facilities are becoming more sophisticated business enterprises that seek innovative technologies like ours, as well as well-honed business and operational processes, to produce, at scale, high-quality products with consistency that meet the growing demand and needs of end users. Through our Agrify “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution, our customers gain the ability and huge advantage to create consistent high-quality products with repeatability across all of their operations, wherever located, similar to any other consumer product company such as branded food or drink product companies.

Indoor Agricultural Industry Overview
 
The demand for indoor agriculture has been growing at a rapid pace throughout the world (particularly in our target market in the U.S.), and presents significant opportunities for companies like ours that leverage technology, services and experience to accelerate our growth and capture additional market share. According to an analysis conducted by Research and Markets, the global indoor farming market (excluding cannabis) was valued at $114 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $139 billion by 2025, representing a CAGR of 3.4%.

There are a variety of factors that have created this major shift toward indoor farming, including unpredictable climate conditions, increased urbanization and the use of pesticides. Additionally, crops grown in indoor facilities generally attract the highest prices in the market as the ability to control environmental variables typically leads to higher quality production. Furthermore, technology innovations within the broader agriculture industry are enabling the indoor sector of the market to expand. According to MarketsandMarkets™ Indoor Farming Technology Report, the indoor farming technology market was valued at $31 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $53 billion by 2025, representing a CAGR of 9.65%.
 
Indoor farms grow a wide variety of crops including leafy greens, tomatoes, cannabis, hemp, flowers, microgreens and herbs. These crops have historically been good crops to grow indoors because they generate high revenues and/or have quick growth cycles. These attributes help offset the fact that it can be costly to operate an indoor facility. Even with these dynamics, we believe that our products and solutions mix can significantly push down our customers’ OpEx over time. One of the biggest advantages of indoor farming is its higher predictability and yield potential when compared with conventional farming. By working with enclosed and controlled facilities, farmers no longer need to contend with harsh environmental conditions, so they can grow a crop from seed to harvest in less time, realize higher yields in each cycle, and repeat the harvest more times in a given year.
 
Within the indoor agriculture space, there has been a big push to leverage the power of vertical farming and technology to further improve production in novel ways. Vertical farming is a transformative approach to cultivation that is used to produce various foods and medicinal plants in vertically stacked layers such as in open warehouses or shipping containers. Our products are designed specifically to serve the vertical farming market.
 
According to Allied Market Research, the global vertical farming market size was valued at $2.23 billion in 2018, and is projected to reach $12.77 billion by 2026, representing a CAGR of 24.6% from 2019 to 2026. Global Market Insights is even more bullish on this sector as they are expecting the global vertical farming market to experience a massive CAGR of 27.77% between 2019 and 2026, taking the value from $3.16 billion in 2018 to $22.07 billion by 2026. The demand for vertical farming is expected to increase rapidly due in large part to the rise in popularity of organic food as well as the lessening of legal and regulatory restrictions around cannabis and hemp.
 
One of the main drivers behind the increased prominence of vertical farming is that the vertically stacked structure of these farms reduces the need for additional construction activity and land. However, a high level of initial capital is often required for setting up the indoor vertical structure with all of the necessary lighting and irrigation systems. This is something we have been very mindful of when designing (and as we continue to improve) our products as well as when we launched our new architectural, engineering, consulting and construction services and our new product financing program.
 
While the ability to use previously untapped vertical space for cultivation offers tremendous upside for an existing facility, the advent of cutting-edge technological solutions like ours should help indoor growers push the boundaries of what is possible to an even greater extent. Indoor growers are now relying on technology to help them increase plant yields, generate higher revenues, manage operations and improve crop quality, and our products and services are geared directly towards satisfying the technology needs of our customers.
 
According to the State of Indoor Farming 2017 report by Agrilyst (now known as Artemis), which incorporated feedback and insights from over 150 indoor growers throughout the world as well as research from Cornell University, small farms (which were defined as less than 10,000 square feet) on average have an annual budget of $7.68 per square foot to invest in technology and large farms (which were defined as at or above 10,000 square feet) on average spend about $9.34 per square foot on technology to foster an environment where they can produce more with less. As a result, we believe there is clearly a demonstrated willingness to spend on integrating technological solutions into the way indoor farms are structured both now and in the future to help those operators achieve many of their financial-related goals around increasing revenues and decreasing costs.

In polling a wide variety of indoor cultivators, Artemis discovered that “automation tops the list of technologies growers are most excited about. Second to automation is HVAC (heating, venting, and air conditioning) equipment. Third was a tie between data analytics, LED lighting, and sensors.” With the high cost of labor, it is no surprise that automation, which is a big part of our value proposition, ranked number one in this poll as most progressive growers are thinking strategically about what aspects of their business can be delegated to technological solutions instead of expensive personnel. Technology is driving significant change in the agriculture industry and will enable growers to enhance margin and institutionalize the process in which they grow.
 
One of the ancillary benefits of this increased emphasis on technology is that it is giving indoor cultivators the confidence to expand their footprint. In fact, 84% of the farms that participated in the Artemis study reported that they are planning to expand their facilities in the five years spanning 2018 to 2022. More importantly, their growth plans were quite ambitious as they indicated they will be adding 22.3 million square feet of growing area. A lot of this expansion is being spearheaded by leafy greens growers as they expect to augment their existing operations with 15 million square feet in new growing area.
 
We believe our team, strategy and “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution have all evolved to meet the needs of indoor growers and capitalize on all of the growth that is expected throughout our total addressable market over the next decade.
 
Well-Established Crop Market Opportunities
 
With the right equipment, setup and configuration, cultivators can grow almost anything within an indoor vertical farm. With so many options at their fingertips, farmers face a huge opportunity cost when deciding what to grow and how to grow it. Even if a certain crop is biologically viable in an indoor setting, it may not be commercially viable. Consequently, there are a number of important factors including equipment, processes and economics that drive cultivators to narrow their focus to a small subset of crops that are the most conducive to long-term profitability.
 
Given that it is expensive to operate an indoor facility, the crops that generally get the most grow space are those that generate high revenues and/or have quick grow cycles. The result, as reported in the State of Indoor Farming 2017 report by Agrilyst (now known as Artemis), is a distribution of output and activity heavily skewed toward leafy greens, tomatoes, herbs, flowers and microgreens, which easily represented the majority of crops grown indoors at that time.
 
These findings were largely reinforced in the 2019 Global CEA (Controlled Environment Agriculture) Census. As part of this joint project spearheaded by Agritecture LLC and Autogrow, 316 indoor farms in more than 50 countries responded to a wide variety of questions to uncover insights and trends across several key areas of the indoor agriculture industry including what crops are being grown most frequently.
 
The majority of indoor farms that took part in the 2019 Global CEA Census stated that they are still focusing the bulk of their efforts on leafy greens (herbs, salad greens and microgreens) due to their quick crop cycles and high percentage of harvestable biomass. In looking at the numbers, 65% of all respondents indicated that they grow salad greens and microgreens including 61% in indoor vertical farms.
 
The bagged salad market is a perfect example of a booming industry and also one that illustrates society’s increasing preference for healthy and clean foods. According to Grand View Research, the global packaged salad market is currently a $5.24 billion market. The CAGR is projected to be 10.2% between 2020 and 2027, which would bring the value of this market to $10.23 billion by 2027.

The following chart shows all of the crops grown across the indoor vertical farms that participated in the 2019 Global CEA Census:
 

Crops Grown By Operation — Indoor Vertical Farming (2019 Global CEA Census)
 
With many new ventures entering this market and a large portion of the well-established entities in expansion mode, it is clear that indoor farming is here to stay and will be a big part of the future of food production both in the U.S. and throughout the rest of the world. Despite its rise in popularity, the indoor farming industry is not without its challenges, many of which are financial and operational in nature. While indoor farmers are generally progressive and well-intentioned, there is still a lot of work to be done before their facilities morph into truly optimized production and profit centers. This represents a sizeable opportunity for outside vendors to bring fresh perspectives and further innovation into the mix.
 
We believe that our technology is a key missing ingredient that can help indoor growers of salad greens, microgreens, herbs, other leafy greens, vine vegetables and berries maximize yields, improve crop quality and consistency, and decrease production costs over time.
 
Cannabis Market Opportunity
 
While we do not cultivate, come in contact with, distribute or dispense cannabis or any cannabis derivatives that are currently prohibited under U.S. federal law, our cultivation solutions can be used within indoor grow facilities by cannabis cultivators if they choose to do so.
 
In the U.S., the development and growth of the regulated medical and recreational (adult use) cannabis industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate cannabis for medicinal reasons allow patients to consume cannabis with a designated healthcare provider’s recommendation, subject to various requirements and limitations. As of the date of this report, 33 states, plus the District of Columbia, have passed laws allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis. On top of this medical condition growth trend, there has been a slower but steady increase in the number of states that have chosen to legalize cannabis for recreational use. As of the date of this report, 11 states, plus the District of Columbia, have passed laws allowing adult recreational use cannabis. Furthermore, every single cannabis initiative on the ballot during the 2020 election passed, which resulted in five more states choosing to legalize cannabis in some capacity. Three of those states decided to begin allowing recreational use, one state voted to legalize medicinal cannabis, and the last state became the first state to legalize both medicinal and recreational cannabis during the same election. Shifting public attitudes and state law and legislative activity are driving this change as indicated by a 2019 poll by Quinnipiac University that found that 93% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis, if recommended by a doctor, which was the same level of support from a similar poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in 2018. Similarly, the trend toward further legalization and regulation of cannabis sales is spreading globally. As of the date of this report, over 20 countries outside the U.S. currently have medicinal cannabis regulation in force, and that number is expected to significantly increase over time.
 
Given that the market size of legal cannabis in the U.S. in 2020 is expected to be $17 billion according to New Frontier, and 53% of cannabis volume is currently grown indoors according to New Leaf Data Services, we estimate that the indoor segment of the legal U.S. cannabis sector is a $9 billion market with the expectation that there will be even more growth on the horizon. In fact, according to a report from April 2020, BDSA, the leading provider of cannabis industry market research, in conjunction with Arcview Market Research, forecasted that U.S. legal cannabis sales will approach $34 billion by 2025, which represents 72% of their projection for total global sales of $47 billion in 2025.

The different cultivation environments for cannabis each have advantages and disadvantages, and this leads to a variance in price points based on quality, actual and perceived, and process. According to New Leaf Data Services’ July 10, 2020 U.S. cannabis spot index, the average wholesale price per pound of outdoor grown flower was $904 per pound ($896 per pound the prior week), greenhouse flower averaged $1,216 per pound ($1,215 per pound the prior week), while indoor grown flower averaged $1,778 per pound ($1,777 per pound the prior week) and the total market on average was $1,441 per pound ($1,435 per pound the prior week). Based on the breakdown of production by cultivation environment, indoor grown flower represents 53% of total volume by type while greenhouse and outdoor represent 23% and 24%, respectively. Additionally, based on the breakdown of percentage of observed transactions, indoor grown flower represents 64% of total volume by type while greenhouse and outdoor represent 18% and 18%, respectively.
 
Outdoor cannabis has the lowest initial capital expenditures required to start cultivation. According to Marijuana Business Daily (MBD), the average startup cost per square foot of outdoor cultivation is $10. The expansive size of outdoor grows and their reliance on natural soil, lighting and weather conditions means cultivators have relatively few infrastructure needs. They can get their business off the ground quickly and with minimal upfront expenditures trading quality for lower cost production.
 
Greenhouse grown cannabis commands a higher price per pound than field grown cannabis as the more protected environment produces higher quality flower. According to MBD, the average startup cost per square foot for greenhouse cultivation is $50, but the true costs tend to be all over the map with an executive from Ohio-based Rough Brothers, an 84-year-old greenhouse company that started taking on cannabis clients in 2013, opining that such costs can vary greatly, going so far as to say “I could build you a cannabis greenhouse for $20 a square foot or $200 a square foot.”
 
Indoor grown cannabis commands the highest price per pound as it produces the highest quality flower due to the fact that growers have the most control over the environment. Indoor cultivation facilities vary significantly in sophistication and technology with the build-out costs reflecting that fact. While MBD states that the average startup cost per square foot for indoor cultivation is $75, anything close to that cost would inevitably yield a primitive and arguably insufficient setup. In contrast, Jennifer Martin, a prominent cannabis cultivation consultant, indicated on MarijuanaPropagation.com that a far more advanced and scalable configuration would likely cost between $400 to $500 per square foot. In general, the more a company invests up front, the higher the upside will be in the future. However, beyond initial build-out costs, it has historically been very expensive to grow cannabis in an indoor facility. The industry norm for direct production-related operating costs ranges from approximately $436 per pound according to a competitive cost analysis conducted by MJardin to $516 per pound, which is based on another examination of cultivation costs by the website CannaBusinessPlans.com.

Stacked AVFUs
 
The AVFU is a premium indoor grow solution with an MSRP starting at $20,000, and our most recent AVFU deals have been for between 60 and 535 units as our new customers become satisfied that our grow solutions will be an instrumental part of their operations moving forward. We are targeting large scale projects that range in size from $1 million to over $10 million in AVFU hardware sales before any additional revenue from our Agrify Insights™ software and ancillary products and services are realized.
 
To further illustrate the benefit of going with the AVFU infrastructure versus a more traditional indoor cultivation setup with conventional LED lights or conventional HPS lights, we have conducted a comparative analysis internally on an actual 45,082 square foot facility.

The first image below is a concept drawing we did showing 752 double stacked AVFUs in this facility. The second image is a concept drawing showing a traditional grow room setup in the exact same facility. The AVFU framework in this particular facility leads to approximately 3x more canopy square footage, which then translates into approximately 4x more estimated annual yield and significantly enhanced revenue opportunities.

Set forth below are the illustrative costs and revenue potential for cultivators of three different approaches in our conservative and defensible model:

While the upfront cost is more for the facility that is outfitted in AVFUs, that is quickly offset by the fact that an AVFU outfitted facility has the capacity to generate about 4x the amount of estimated annual revenue and over 4x the annual estimated EBITDA. In looking at the numerical values in the model, it becomes even more compelling when comparing the AVFU facility to a facility with a traditional grow room. Assuming an initial investment of approximately $27.7 million for the AVFU facility build-out, our model indicates that the facility owner would recoup their initial investment and produce significant free cash flow in the first year of operation assuming the facility should be able to achieve almost $88 million of estimated annual revenue and roughly $78.4 million in annual estimated EBITDA. In contrast, the traditional indoor facilities would cost approximately $8.8 million or a little less than $16.5 million to build out depending on which lights are used and would generate approximately $20.4 million or $22.5 million in estimated annual revenue and right around $16 million or just under $19 million in annual estimated EBITDA. When comparing the different facility types on a side-by-side analysis, we believe the AVFU facility is far more attractive than either type of traditional facility given the financial upside is significantly higher, and also the precision elevated approach is a far more sophisticated way to grow crops.
 
We have also modeled out another scenario in which a prospective customer has a license that stipulates that they are permitted to operate with at most 16,200 square feet of canopy space in their facility (which is the exact same amount of canopy square footage displayed in the above model for the traditional setup in the 45,082 square foot facility). However, given the modular and stackable nature of the AVFUs, we are able to help the customer achieve the same canopy square footage with 253 AVFUs in a facility that is only 20,000 square feet, which is less than half the size of the traditional facility. We have included concept drawings for both facilities below. While canopy square footage is basically identical for all of the different cultivation approaches we looked at in this particular simulation, the AVFU setup requires a much smaller and theoretically much less expensive facility, and because the AVFUs are more productive, the estimated annual yield is about 31% higher than in the facility with the traditional grow room setup and conventional LED lights and 45% higher than in the facility with the traditional grow room setup and conventional HPS lights.

In this case, the estimated total build-out cost for the AVFU facility is approximately $5 million less than the facility with conventional LED lights, but approximately $2.6 million more than the facility with conventional HPS lights. Compared to the facility with conventional LED lights, the AVFU facility is less expensive to build and expected to drive considerably more yield, revenue and EBITDA. Even considering the roughly $2.6 million initial cost savings to build the facility with the conventional HPS lights compared to the AVFU facility, the overall economics still favor the AVFU facility as it should generate over $9 million more in estimated annual revenue and over $10 million more in annual estimated EBITDA, with a slightly faster payback period.

Facility with AVFU Setup
 
Additionally, our LED lights, have shown promising results on their own within a 50,000 square foot facility for one of our leafy green customers. This customer reported that our LED lights allowed them to increase their sellable output for romaine lettuce from approximately 92 pounds per grow board to over 210 pounds per grow board, and the amount of their sellable butter lettuce went from 105 pounds per grow board to over 128 pounds per grow board. We believe this result is typical and can be replicated because the increased crop output was the direct result of increased light output and superior light uniformity. Per watt of electricity in, our LEDs produce more usable photons to drive photosynthesis than incandescent, fluorescent, HID or most LED lights on the market.
 
Overall, this customer experienced a roughly 28% increase in revenue after only 7 weeks of using our lights. They have also reported a noticeable improvement in the appearance of their end products with their chopped romaine looking fuller and greener when grown under our lights versus the lights of another vendor. Lastly, this customer indicated that they are benefiting from a 1-2 day extension in average shelf life.
 
Our premium indoor grow solutions, whether it’s our AVFUs or our LED lights, are designed, engineered and calibrated to drive significant improvements for our customers, who trust us to deliver the type of productivity and quality that was previously unattainable.
 
Agrify Integrated Grow Racks (AIGR)
 
We currently offer 2 ft. x 8 ft. indoor agricultural integrated grow racks to supplement the growing process that is occurring within the AVFUs. These racks are differentiated based on the number of integrated shelving tiers within the grow rack system: 2-tier, 4-tier, and 5-tier grow racks. Each shelving tier consists of: Two Agrify Model W 2 ft. x 4 ft. LED grow lights, hydroponic plumbing, and a drainable basin. Our grow racks have been designed to optimize working conditions, allowing a farm hand/grower to plant, inspect and harvest crops with increased ease. The manufacturer’s suggested retail price on these units ranges from $5,000 to $7,500.
 
17

 


4-Tier Agrify Integrated Grow Rack
 
The difference between an AIGR and an AVFU is an AIGR is designed as a propagation unit with the intended purpose to support the ongoing need in a facility for new plant stock (i.e. plants to grow). The AIGR will support clones or seedlings for 2-4 weeks while they build a root system and grow into “teenage” (more mature) plants. Once that occurs, the plants will be repotted into a larger container and then transferred to an AVFU where the plants will grow to maturity through their vegetative and flowering phases until the flowers produced are ripe and can be harvested.
Agrify Insights™
 
A key component of our cultivation solution is our proprietary software, Agrify Insights™, which has been developed in-house. A cloud-based software as a service that interfaces with a microservices middleware and relational database that integrates with our hardware and provides our managers, facility owners, facility managers, and growers real-time control and monitoring of facilities, growing conditions, and insights into both production and profit optimization. The combination of precise environmental control and automation with data collection and actionable insights empowers our customers to be more efficient, more productive, and more intelligent about how they run their businesses. We believe that the robust data analytics capabilities from our Agrify Insights™ platform coupled with our AVFU system is enabling our customers to transform their businesses and quality of the product they are cultivating.
 
Our business model includes charging customers a monthly recurring SaaS subscription fee per deployed AVFU for access to Agrify Insights™, which ranges from $75 to $200 per AVFU per month depending on the level of functionality and support purchased. This provides us with a predictable recurring revenue stream that has high expected customer retention due to the fact that our Agrify Insights™ software is required to operate our AVFUs, and our customers are deeply committed to using our AVFUs. We believe that most customers will opt for our more robust levels of functionality and support. Consequently, we expect our annual SaaS revenue will be between 8% to 10% of total AVFU order value.
 
The Agrify Insights™ software is focused around optimizing four key components:
 

● | Optimization at the plant level; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimization at the AVFU unit level; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimization at the facility level; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimization at the business level. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
18

 

When these key components are combined, they encompass the cultivation operations of an Agrify customer. By reducing human error and providing insights through data collection and analysis, Agrify Insights™ minimizes risk and increases operational efficiencies. Ultimately, our customers are seeking to produce the same consistent end product no matter where they are located. Through our technology grow platform, we enable our customers to have the ability to create brands that are identifiable by taste, look and smell no different than any other consumer product company that provides a branded food or drink product.
 
Plant-Level Optimization
 
Central to our solution is granular control of the cultivation environment. The end-product of a crop is determined by both the plant’s genetics and the environment in which the plants are grown. Control over the growing environment is accomplished through the Agrify Insights™ software. By recoding over 1.5 million data points per AVFU per year and being able to reproduce specific environments based on the data, cultivators are effectively able to minimize the variation in their crops and dial-in the maximum quality. Further individual plant varietals can be optimized by tailoring the grow plan (recipe for cultivation) to enhance particular genetic traits; increasing the temperature can speed chemical processes and growth rates, adjusting the ratio of blue to red light can enhance the production of certain aromatic chemical compounds, and adjusting the length of different phases of a plant’s lifecycle can maximize the crop’s yield. Additionally, when new varieties of plants are cultivated, having multiple controlled, compartmentalized, growth chambers allow for iterative experiments which offer real insight into how new varieties are best cultivated. For example, you can grow a new variety in 5 different AVFUs that are set to mimic the climate of different geographies to see where the varieties are suited to grow.
 
Our “Grow Plans” are the templates or recipes that define the parameters for each lifecycle. Grow Plans define the environmental settings (light - photoperiod and intensity/ temp / humidity / VPD / CO2 / irrigation / fertilization) for each crop variety and cultivator as well as the schedule for completing, as applicable, “plant-touching” tasks such as bottoming, pruning, and harvest. Agrify Insights™ ships to the customer with many pre-developed Grow Plans and customers can create their own particular Grow Plans, electing to share them with other customers or not.
 
Individual AVFU Level Optimization
 
Our AVFU hardware provides cultivation environmental control within the growth chamber. This hardware and its component valves, motors and sensors are directed and controlled by Agrify Insights™.

● | Monitor and Control Agrify Hardware. Agrify Insights™ can either automatically or manually control our hardware. For example, the water-chilled fan coil can keep temperature in a range accurate to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cultivation Environmental Control. Using Agrify Insights™, users can view environmental charts that plot temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and vapor pressure deficit (or VPD) over time. It also shows when the plants were irrigated and whether the unit is in cooling, circulating, or dehumidifying mode. We sample these values every minute and report them back to the cloud every 15 minutes, or more often if there have been significant changes. Each growing chamber reports approximately one million data points annually, enabling our clients to perform in-depth analysis of grow performance. The manual control screen visualizes the current state of the grow chamber and enables our technicians to take direct control for troubleshooting, if necessary. The device log shows us what decisions were made by the onboard Agrify Insights™ and why. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facility Level Optimization
 
Our modular AVFUs are deployed in scale at a customer’s facility with the smallest deployment to date being 63 AVFUs. Agrify Insights™ is designed to operate these individual AVFUs as a combined facility. Agrify Insights™ features at the facility level include:

● | Production Planning. The production planning feature is designed to maximize a facility’s utilization by executing a “best-fit” scheduling algorithm to selected Grow Plans across the growing units that have been deployed at a customer facility. Since grow plans typically have a different number of growing days that start on staggered schedules, this module is a critical component for optimizing the planting and moving schedules, significantly increasing plant production and reducing the cost per pound of harvest. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Workforce Management. Agrify Insights™ includes a workforce planning feature to assign tasks to staff. These tasks can be automatically assigned based on user role or their knowledge, skills, and abilities. The calendar displays the estimated amount of time required to complete plant-touching tasks on any given day. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automatic Notification System. Users can select to subscribe to anomalous events, and users are notified in the order in which they are listed. If a user does not acknowledge the notification within the specified time frame, the next user in the list is notified, providing the business with 24/7 monitoring and notifications. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preventative Maintenance. Our equipment and facility preventative maintenance schedules and related tasks are contained, tracked and monitored within Agrify Insights™. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Facility Infrastructure Controls. Agrify Insights™ controls the irrigation on a facility level as well as connects with the water chilled HVAC system and ambient lighting system, providing our customers a central piece of software for facility management. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Optimization at the Business Level
 
Agrify Insights™ analysis features enable customers to understand how cultivation decisions impact their overall business. Understanding the data from the cultivation facility can help our customers better plan and make informed decisions that impact downstream parts of their business.
 

● | Consumables Procurement Integration. Each task can also be assigned a set of consumables whose inventory will be reduced when the task is started. This feature can help customers manage supply levels and can automatically create and submit purchase orders so that they never run out of required supplies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Online SOPs and Safety Datasheets. Agrify Insights™ hosts digital copies of our included Standard Operating Procedures and datasheets, or users can upload their own via our content management system, ensuring that the most recent version of SOPs and forms are available to users. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Roles-Based Dashboards. Ability to obtain access to information specifically suited to your workforce’s various needs. Facility owners have access to high-level information about crop yields and equipment usage in an easy to understand scorecard. Farm managers receive a worksheet and calendar that lets them manage their workforce and automatically assign plant-touching tasks. This also provides facility managers with an ongoing window into consumables and lets them set inventory levels. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data Collection. Agrify Insights™ is a centralized repository for all data relating to the cultivation aspects of our clients’ business, including research and development testing data, and the ability to capture and compare test results. By doing so, Agrify Insights™ becomes a customers’ cultivation statement of record. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulatory Reporting Integration. We have integrated our software with Metrc, a leading seed-to-harvest compliance management and tracking solution, which will enable our customers to handle most regulatory reporting directly through Agrify Insights™.

Bluezone Model 420 — Air Cleaning System
 
Destructive impact from pathogens is a major issue for our customers and their industry. The Bluezone Model 420 is a U.S. military tested and fielded air purification system that kills and removes airborne pathogens such as powdery mildew, botrytis, and other highly infectious bacteria from indoor grow rooms and produce storage. Such interferences can drastically interrupt businesses’ supply chains, leading to lost time and revenue.
 
20

 


Bluezone Model 420
 
Each unit covers 15,000 cubic feet or air volume. The unit draws air into a self-contained reaction chamber and kills contaminants with ultraviolet-enhanced oxidation, and chemicals are broken down so that the air circulating through the Bluezone comes out clean and safe. Bluezone is California Air Resources Board (CARB) Certified for ozone emissions, as ozone is kept inside the Bluezone reaction chamber. Bluezone is also ETL Safety Certified and NSF Sanitation Certified. The MSRP for the Bluezone Model 420 is $4,500.
 
We are the exclusive distributor for the Bluezone Model 420 for the indoor agriculture market worldwide.

To date, we have generated limited revenue from sales of Bluezone products.
 
Enozo — Pesticide-Free Surface Protection
 
The Enozo spray bottle offers a water-based alternative to traditional cleaners, deodorizers, and sanitizers. This surface cleaning solution uses ozonated water to kill 99.9% of bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella in only 30 seconds. Aqueous ozone (AO) is a very powerful sanitizer produced in controlled concentrations (below OSHA PEL and STEL requirements) and contains no harsh chemicals, fragrances or dyes. This technology is designed to help reduce workplace illnesses and hazards like irritated skin and allergic reactions, while protecting indoor air quality and physical surfaces.
Enozo Spray Bottle
 
21

 

Enozo dispenses at least 10 full reservoirs (one gallon) of aqueous ozone sanitizing solution per charge, lasting 5,000 refills over the unit’s battery life. This eliminates the need to buy hundreds of plastic, one-time use bottles of cleaners. Enozo is registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for public health use. The manufactuerer’s suggested retail price for the Enozo spray bottle is $499.
 
We have rights to sell Enozo products pursuant to a distribution agreement between us and Enozo Technologies Inc.

Our Services
 
Agrify-Valiant Joint Venture
 
In December 2019, we established Agrify-Valiant, LLC as a joint venture with Valiant-America. Valiant-America is experienced in consulting and general contracting of a wide range of industrial facilities, but it has a particular specialization and expertise in the development of indoor farming facilities. Valiant’s qualified professionals possess a deep working knowledge of our grow systems and how to integrate our offerings when developing cultivation facilities.
 
Given that many of our customers are either new entrants to the market or companies in expansion mode, it became obvious to us that the majority of them need many services other than just equipment and software, including architectural, engineering, construction and installation services, which we are able to now offer through our joint venture with Valiant-America. The Agrify-Valiant joint venture complements our offering and provides our clients with an end-to-end turnkey solution. We believe being able to provide a full suite of technology products and services to these customers helps to embed us with these customers and enables us to become mission critical to their operations.
 
Through this strategic and synergistic partnership, we are able to offer our customers relevant value-added services related to architectural, engineering, construction and installation needs, and we are also able to derive significant revenues from the indoor agriculture deals that close under the auspices of this joint venture. Given that we are a majority 60% owner of, and control, the Agrify-Valiant, LLC, we consolidate 100% of the revenues that go through the joint venture, and we recognize 60% of all net profits. Revenue from Agrify-Valiant is recognized after the agreed upon work has been completed. Pursuant to the operating agreement of Agrify-Valiant, at any time between the second and fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, we have the right to “call” Valiant’s 40% equity interest from Valiant, and Valiant has the right to “put” its 40% equity interest to us. The consideration for the equity purchased pursuant to this right shall be paid in shares of our common stock based on a formula taking into account at the time of exercise the fair market value of our common stock, as well as our gross sales and net earnings.

Equipment Financing 
 
We recognize that many new cultivators face particular capital and time constraints, and we also recognize that the initial cost of our equipment can be a deterrent for some. We solve this problem by offering equipment financing plans for select good credit customers, which we believe further enables us to become a vendor of choice. While we proactively show our prospects that the strong and immediate return on investment derived from Agrify solutions will more than make up for associated start-up costs, we wanted to do even more to support our prospective customers, which is why we unveiled an equipment financing program to help remove this final barrier to entry for otherwise excited cultivators. This requires participating credit-worthy customers to pay a substantial down payment, typically between 30% and 50% of the purchase price, with the balance financed over two years, with interest, under commercially reasonable terms.
Competitive Landscape
 
We believe our full suite of product offerings form an unmatched ecosystem for indoor growing. At this time, our Agrify Vertical Farming Unit, our overall bundled solution and our engineering/installation services are highly differentiated from anything else on the market so in one sense we do not have any direct competitors who offer the same type of comprehensive value proposition and single-source benefit.
 
At the same time, our customers are actively being approached by a variety of companies who do offer compelling standalone products and services so we recognize that our customers do have choices and alternatives, and they also need to factor in opportunity cost whenever they make purchasing decisions. Consequently, we more broadly define our competition as any other company going after the same finite budget dollars as us in the indoor agriculture space. We have highlighted below the most notable players that operate across some of the same functional highly fragmented areas of agriculture technology that we operate.

Despite the presence of some well-funded and well-established competitors who offer pieces of what we do, we are able to compete on the basis of several defensible factors including our industry experience, our technical expertise, the differentiated value proposition of our individual offerings, and our positioning as a single-source provider. However, we believe above all else, it’s our ability to offer an unrivaled level of precision through a total end-to-end turnkey solution that sets us apart from existing competitors and potential new market entrants.
 
Our Customers
 
We primarily market and sell our products to newly licensed, well-funded producers in a single market as well as multi-state operators. Our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including the breadth and availability of the products we offer, our extensive expertise, and the quality of our customer service. For large multi-state operators, our solutions allow operators to produce consistent high-quality products regardless of the geographic locations where they are licensed to operate. Our system removes the variations of local grow environment, and also provides consistent standard operating procedures across different facilities, helping every facility to achieve the highest GMP standards. Our ability to provide a “one-stop shop” experience allows us to be the preferred vendor to many of these customers by streamlining their entry into or expansion of their cultivation capabilities. In addition, we believe our customers find great value in the advice and recommendations provided by our knowledgeable sales and service associates, which further increases demand for our products.

We believe the nature of our solutions and our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business as our customers’ businesses expand. In addition, we feel as if our premium product lines and comprehensive product portfolio position us well to meet our customers’ needs. Furthermore, we fully anticipate that we will be able to leverage all of the data that we are collecting from our existing customer base to make continuous improvements to our offerings and better serve our current and new customers in the future.
 
To date, we have customers in the following states: Nevada, Colorado, Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Illinois. We also have a customer in Oman.
 
As for our enterprise-level business, we currently have 386 AVFUs deployed and 1,140 AVFUs in the backlog, and all of them will be powered by Agrify Insights™. Our existing active deployments cover approximately 75,000 square feet of facility space, and that number is expected to grow significantly once we go live with some of our newer customers and once we are able to close more deals from our $105 million qualified pipeline.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We have developed a multi-pronged growth strategy as described below to help us capitalize on the sizable opportunity at hand. Through methodical sales and marketing efforts, our joint venture with Valiant-America, scale-up manufacturing, and equipment financing, we believe we have implemented several key initiatives we can use to grow our business more effectively. We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance shareholder value. We believe we have made significant progress in 2020 in the form of $66.8 million in new bookings, and we expect this amount to increase based on the strength of the opportunities in our qualified pipeline. We believe our revenues will be enhanced by the many improvements we have made and the growth strategy we have started to implement since Raymond Chang (our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer) and Guichao Hua (a member of our board of directors) purchased a controlling interest in our company in 2019 and rebranded us as Agrify. Specifically, we have made it a priority to develop our core bundled hardware and software indoor cultivation solution, and we have augmented that with some strategic acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and distribution arrangements that we believe will enable us to scale our business as a highly differentiated leader in the indoor agriculture marketplace.
Sales and Marketing
 
Rigorous Sales Process and Strong Infrastructure in Place to Enable Revenue Growth
 
We utilize a rigorous Sandler Training sales process to evaluate potential new opportunities and then advance vetted prospects through the different phases of our qualified pipeline. The Sandler Training sales process is a sales process that was originally developed in 1967 by David Sandler as a conscious departure from more traditional sales methods that often relied on pushy and aggressive tactics. The Sandler Training sales process, which is based on the psychology of human behavior, is consistent with the values and culture we have chosen to implement at Agrify, and consequently our salespeople spend most of their time building relationships and qualifying opportunities in order to make closing new business more streamlined, collaborative and organic in nature. There are specific requirements, milestones, and events that we have identified along the sales process that must be met to move prospects through the different parts of the buyer journey in order to convert them from vetted opportunities into committed sales orders within a 12-month period. At each phase of the pipeline, a prospect opportunity is assigned a probability value for closing, providing management production forecast ability. We are diligent in making sure that we are engaging in conversations with well-funded entities that are in good standing with any licensing requirements that they face (or entities that are at least on the cusp of being viable candidates for our grow solutions). We also take into account infrastructure, facility readiness and the presence of key personnel.
 
To date, the results of our sales process have been encouraging as there has been a high level of alignment, accountability and achievement amongst our sales team. As of December 31 2020, our backlog, which consists of purchase orders or purchase commitments, is $58.6 million. We expect to recognize approximately $40 million from the backlog as revenue in 2021 and the rest gradually thereafter. As of December 31, 2020, we have $105 million of carefully vetted potential sales opportunities (which we refer to as our qualified pipeline). Of this, $78 million of qualified pipeline was generated through our company directly and $27 million through our Agrify-Valiant Joint-Venture. We are presently working to convert this pipeline into confirmed bookings over the next 12 months. Given our emphasis on large scale high-value enterprise sales versus high-volume sales, we believe that we will be able to significantly scale our business in the coming years without needing to drastically increase our headcount. For us, it is all about having the right well-trained, knowledgeable sales team instead of the largest sales team.

Looking ahead, our sales team is responsible for overseeing nationwide sales and support, and they will drive our expansion into future international markets. Our territory managers work in tandem with our in-house technology solutions and horticultural experts to provide customers a turnkey indoor facility integrated system proposal. Agreements include the equipment being purchased and multi-year SaaS commitments that bring in substantial trailing revenues.
 
Marketing Team Aligned with Sales Force to Maximize Our Industry Visibility to Drive Revenue
 
Our marketing department works in tandem with our sales and business development representatives to best represent and sell our Agrify “Precision Elevated™” cultivation solution to the indoor agriculture industry. The sales and business development representatives push prospects through a sales funnel, also known as a “buyer’s journey”. A strategic sales model has been developed to create a seamless transition from the initial communication with a prospect through targeted messaging and eventually moving all the way through the funnel. The movement through this funnel is referred to as TOFU/MOFU/BOFU (Top of the Funnel/Middle of the Funnel/Bottom of the Funnel), which is focused on attention, consideration and decision-making, keeping the messaging consistent, the potential buyer engaged, and ultimately leads the prospect to close on a deal.
 
Our sales funnel duties are completed using a customer relationship management (CRM) system, which allows us to track, qualify, and report on the ROI of our marketing initiatives. Leads are added into our pipeline funnel predominantly through our digital marketing efforts, including direct marketing, organic social media growth, thought leadership, and demand generation via paid advertisements and press releases.
 
Direct Marketing
 
We capitalize on our direct marketing efforts by utilizing our internal CRM database, as well as the external help of trusted industry databases to target the right audience. Additionally, by taking advantage of our partners’ networks, such as those of Valiant-America, Bluezone, and Enozo, we are able to reach an extensive and reliable list of cultivators and industry professionals. Emails go out on a weekly basis and are subdivided by product focus and state, depending on the campaign. We use A/B testing in our email campaign strategy in order to harness meaningful messages that result in 40% engagement and above average open and click through rates. We are turning impressions into contacts at a rapid rate and have managed to grow our contact list by over 100% in one quarter. We are seeing 20% of these leads become sales qualified and 10% result in an opportunity.
Social Media and Thought Leadership
 
Through the creation and promotion of engaging content that positions us as a thought leader, we continue to organically grow our social media audience. We share original video, photography, industry-related articles, and blog content on a consistent basis. By developing strategic partnerships with well-known and respected brands, we are working to better position ourselves with marketing and branding efforts on social. Furthermore, we promote our social media in our communication via email and on our website. We also keep our finger on the pulse of trends and competitors in the market, remaining in-the-know. We have successfully more than doubled our social media presence across all platforms in the first half of 2020 and continue to show improvement in transitioning our social media audience into prospects.
Trade Shows
 
While digital marketing has been a consistent driver of leads and visibility for Agrify, trade shows related to various indoor agriculture topics have also proven to be highly effective. When attending trade shows, we typically position ourselves front and center, with high-level sponsorships and outstanding booth placement and presentation. Our product and subject matter experts take advantage of speaking opportunities, positioning Agrify as industry thought leaders. We expect to continue to grow our industry presence by generating leads using conferences as a platform. The trade show plan has been carefully vetted to ensure that these shows are reputable, have a strong business to business focus, high foot-traffic rates, as well as hosted in a desirable market.
 
25

 

In 2019, we were able to capture over 800 leads at our biggest event and over 200 leads per show at smaller regional conferences. More than 75% have become marketing qualified leads, of which 50% later became sales qualified. Many of these leads are now customers or in the process of becoming customers. We are seeing the largest amount of marketing qualified leads come through our trade show attendance. Given the proven success of these conferences, their reputation, their audiences and their industry magnitude, we expect to continue to seek headline and sponsorship roles. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, only three trade shows have been completed so far in 2020, with several others have been postponed. Accordingly, during the pandemic we have reallocated our resources to focus more heavily on our other means of generating leads, particularly through expanding our direct sales force.
 
Paid Advertising
 
We utilize paid advertising such as banner ads on high-trafficked media sites that largely focus on agricultural technology and other relevant topics. We provide content offers and other downloadable materials in order to capture these leads. As we gain experience through these different marketing initiatives, we will make appropriate spending adjustments with our most effective outlets. We seek to expand our business both nationally and internationally, and will do so when we have proven, viable marketing options available to us.
Public Relations Campaigns
 
We have successfully gained the interest of press from networks such as CNN, CFN, industry trade journals, and more. With our industry positioning using thought-leadership and on-going participation in industry conferences, we have been highlighted every month through the Newswire and featured in a variety of media outlets. We will continue to sponsor and keynote in industry-related events including; tech and agriculture conferences, podcasts, radio shows and more to continue to gain press and ultimately more exposure.
 
Through our digital marketing efforts, we promote our solutions to customers who stand to benefit most from our products and services, which spans a wide range of indoor agriculture verticals. We aim to bring in at least twenty new qualified leads a week by driving traffic to our website, keeping impression numbers high, while also keeping our cost-per-lead low. As we receive more data, we plan on continuing to monitor the digital efforts that garner the most leads and make adjustments accordingly.
 
Our Joint Venture with Valiant-America
 
In December 2019, we established Agrify-Valiant, LLC as a joint venture with Valiant-America. From a growth perspective, we believe our joint venture with Valiant-America gives us a credible and complementary channel partner with extensive industry relationships to help us gain additional market share by making our solution a prominent part of their discussions involving future projects in this space.
 
We believe this joint venture positions us as the only fully integrated grow solution in the industry as we are now able to provide services around facility design, mechanical and engineering planning, general contracting, hardware and equipment installation, and commissioning for all indoor agriculture customers.
 
We believe our turnkey offerings are highly differentiated from anything else on the market in that they combine our seamlessly integrated hardware and software offerings with a wide range of associated services such as consulting, engineering, and construction to form what we believe is the most complete solution available from a single provider. The totality of our product mix and service capabilities form an unrivaled ecosystem in what has historically been an extremely fragmented market. As a result, we believe we are well situated to create a dominant market position in the indoor agriculture segment.

Scale-Up Manufacturing Capabilities in Order to Meet the Increasing Demand for Our Grow Solutions
 
We currently use contract manufacturers (CMs) in the U.S. and in Asia for prototyping and volume manufacturing, and we plan to expand our capabilities in order to meet the increasing demand for our grow solutions. We design the systems internally, and then work with our CMs and suppliers to refine, prototype, and test the designs. The designs are documented at a level that allows us to have our products manufactured at multiple CMs, both in the U.S. and abroad.
 
Additionally, we work with domestic suppliers on a wide range of metal fabrication to allow for rapid prototyping and product development. One such CM and metal fabrication shop that we have worked with extensively in the past is Harbor Mountain Holdings, LLC (“HMH”), which is based in the Atlanta, GA area. HMH has been producing and assembling many of our products for over three years, and they have served our needs well as a versatile and valued partner. On July 21, 2020, we acquired HMH, including the acquisition of HMH’s research and development, testing, and flexible manufacturing plant located just outside Atlanta, GA, along with key personnel and equipment. We believe this acquisition fits in nicely with our overall scale-up manufacturing strategy. For the remainder of 2020, HMH will be asked to support our AVFU sales and production goals as a primary manufacturing location. In 2021 and beyond, we expect HMH to evolve into more of a service, engineering development and prototyping, and test facility.
 
On December 7, 2020, we entered into a five year supply agreement with Mack Molding Co., a Vermont corporation (“Mack”), pursuant to which Mack will become a key supplier of Company’s AVFUs. Mack is a leading supplier of molded plastic parts, fabricated metal parts and high-level assemblies to the medical, industrial, transportation, energy/environment, computer and business equipment, defense/aerospace and consumer markets. Founded in 1920, Mack is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the privately-held Mack Group corporation, which also includes Mack Technologies and Mack Prototype. The supply agreement contemplates that, following an introductory period, we will negotiate a minimum percentage of our AVFU requirements that we will purchase from Mack each year based on the agreed upon pricing formula. The introductory period is not time-based but rather refers to the production of an initial number of units after which the parties have rights to adjust pricing and negotiate a certain minimum requirements percentage. We believe this approach will result in both parties making a more informed decision with respect to the pricing and other terms of the supply agreement with Mack. In the event we are unable to agree with Mack on pricing or a minimum requirements percentage, either party may terminate the agreement upon notice without further consequence or obligation.
 
We believe the supply agreement with Mack provides us with several key benefits, including:
 

● | Rapid Scaling: We can scale to customer orders, as Mack has agreed to maintain a minimum safety stock of AVFUs in inventory and allow us to store additional inventory pending customer deliveries; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-Term Efficiencies: Under a strategic partner governance structure, we intend to meet with Mack at least quarterly in efforts to improve components acquisition and logistics, to lower production costs over time, provide additional alternatives for third party component vendors and allow us to provide input as to Mack’s overall production process and operational effectiveness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We anticipate that this key strategic relationship with Mack will grow with our continued and expanding need for additional AVFUs.
 
Overall, our approach to manufacturing is to use CMs to prototype, iterate, and begin initial production, then transition to volume production including in lower cost geographies, which results in both rapid time-to-market and low production costs. As we grow, we intend to continually analyze and evolve our manufacturing capabilities to best meet our customer needs while always focusing on ways to maximize operating margins.
 
Equipment Financing Program
 
Our equipment financing program, which we believe is novel in the indoor agriculture space, is instrumental in removing certain points of friction from the sales cycle and it can be a major factor that tips the scales in our favor with certain prospects. When any of our credit-worthy customers take advantage of this opportunity, they are able expedite their speed to market as a result of not having to finance their purchase with 100% equity. As a result, we are able to collect between 30% and 50% of the purchase order immediately, with the balance typically being repaid over a two-year period, with interest, under commercially reasonable terms. By offering this equipment financing option, we have effectively broadened our prospect pool, and we believe that this will lead to more deals closing over time.

In addition, while we know that our current product and service capabilities are highly novel and compelling, we do not intend to be complacent. We will continue to learn from our customers and from the market, and if there is an opportunity to deploy a new and improved version of one of our offerings or if we decide there is room in the market for a new type of solution, we fully intend to diligently explore those possibilities to augment our existing business and grow our reach.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 29, 2021, we had a total of 74 employees, of which 57 are full-time employees, with 20 located in the New England area, 21 in Georgia and 16 in other states. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.

Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may be subject to various claims, legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. On January 5, 2021, we received a demand letter from Nicholas Cooper and Richard Weinstein, two of our former employees (and one of Mr. Cooper’s affiliated entities), asserting that such individuals were entitled to compensation arising out of their employment by us, as well as their partial ownership of TriGrow Systems, Inc. The demand letter asserts that the former employees are due certain sales commissions under their applicable bonus plan, equity earn-outs based on certain sales targets, and various equity purchases through our employee stock ownership plan. The demand letter also asserts various employment claims, including, but not limited to, statutory wage withholding violations, wrongful termination, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud in the inducement, promissory estoppel, minority shareholder oppression, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of state and federal securities laws.
 
On January 19, 2021, Messrs. Cooper and Weinstein filed a lawsuit against Agrify Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging the same claims made in their demand letter based on the same facts disclosed above. The plaintiffs are seeking relief in the form of monetary damages in an amount to be determined. Messrs. Cooper and Weinstein are also seeking relief in the form of reinstatement and Mr. Weinstein is seeking rescission of Mr. Weinstein’s Release of Claims Agreement. On March 10, 2021, we moved to dismiss all of Cooper and Weinstein’s claims, asserting that the claims failed to allege legal grounds for relief. A decision on our motion is expected in the summer of 2021. We do not believe these claims have any merit and intend to vigorously defend against these claims (see note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, to our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020).
 
Corporate History
 
Agrify Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 6, 2016, originally incorporated as Agrinamics, Inc. (or Agrinamics). On September 16, 2019, Agrinamics amended its articles of incorporation to reflect a name change to Agrify Corporation.
 
On January 22, 2020, we and Agrify Merger Sub, Inc., our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary (or Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement of Merger with TriGrow Systems, Inc., a Nevada corporation (or TriGrow), pursuant to which TriGrow was merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation, resulting in our indirect acquisition of TriGrow.
 
On December 8, 2019, we formed Agrify-Valiant, LLC, a 60/40 joint-venture limited liability company, in which we are the 60% majority owner with Valiant-America, LLC, one of the largest premium integrated consulting and general contracting firms in North America with more than 10 years of facility general contracting experience across many states.
 
On July 21, 2020, we acquired Harbor Mountain Holdings, LLC (“HMH”), who we have had a close working relationship with for over three years, including the acquisition of HMH’s research and development, testing, and flexible manufacturing plant located just outside Atlanta, GA, along with key personnel and equipment. We believe this acquisition will give us increased, and in some respects, new in-house resources and capabilities around engineering, prototyping, manufacturing, testing, warehousing and installation services.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, we have included detailed compensation information for only our three most highly compensated executive officers and have not included a compensation discussion and analysis, or CD&A, of our executive compensation programs in this report. In addition, for so long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to:

● | engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes–Oxley Act; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency,” and “say-on-golden parachutes;” or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparison of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of:
 

● | our reporting $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our issuance, in a three-year period, of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | December 31, 2026. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our securities and increased volatility in the price of our securities.
 
Finally, we are a “smaller reporting company” (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and accordingly may provide less public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
