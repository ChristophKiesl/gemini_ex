Item 1. Business.
Overview, History and Recent Developments
 Heritage Global Inc. (“HGI”) was incorporated in Florida in 1983 under the name “MedCross, Inc.” The Company’s name was changed to “I-Link Incorporated” in 1997, to “Acceris Communications Inc.” in 2003, to “C2 Global Technologies Inc.” in 2005, to “Counsel RB Capital Inc.” in 2011, and to Heritage Global Inc. in 2013. The most recent name change more closely identifies HGI with its core auction business, Heritage Global Partners, Inc. (“HGP”).
 In 2014 HGI (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock in National Loan Exchange, Inc. (“NLEX”), a broker of charged-off receivables in the United States and Canada. As a result of this acquisition, NLEX operates as a wholly owned division of the Company.
 In July 2016, the Company completed the sale of its real estate inventory to International Investments and Infrastructure, LLC (“III”) for $4.1 million.  Concurrently, and in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement, the previously existing lease agreement between the Company and an affiliate of III was terminated.  Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  
 In July 2016, the Company repaid $2.5 million of outstanding principal, plus accrued interest, on its loan with an unrelated party (the “Third Party Debt”) and terminated its loan agreement with the third party.  Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

 Asset liquidation
 The Company is a value-driven, innovative leader in corporate and financial asset liquidation transactions, valuations and advisory services.  The Company specializes both in acting as an adviser, as well as acquiring or brokering turnkey manufacturing facilities, surplus industrial machinery and equipment, industrial inventories, real estate, accounts receivable portfolios, intellectual property, and entire business enterprises.
 The Company’s asset liquidation business began operations in 2009 with the establishment of Heritage Global LLC (“HG LLC”). In addition to acquiring turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment, HG LLC arranges traditional asset disposition sales, including liquidation and auction sales. In 2011, HG LLC acquired 100% of the business of EP USA, LLC (“Equity Partners”), thereby expanding the Company’s operations. Equity Partners is a boutique M&A advisory firm and provider of financial solutions for businesses and properties in transition.   
 In 2012 the Company increased its in-house asset liquidation expertise with its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of HGP, a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, and launched Heritage Global Partners Europe (“HGP Europe”). Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Heritage Global Partners UK Limited, the Company opened three European-based offices, one each in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. 
 In 2014, the Company again expanded its asset liquidation operations with the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of NLEX. NLEX is the largest volume broker of charged-off receivables in the United States and Canada, and its offerings include national, state and regional portfolios on behalf of many of the world’s top financial institutions. The NLEX acquisition is consistent with the Company’s strategy to expand and diversify the services provided by its asset liquidation business. 
 As a result of the events and acquisitions outlined above, management believes that the Company’s expanded global platform will allow the Company to achieve its long term industry leadership goals.
 Intellectual property licensing
 Until the third quarter of 2016, the Company held several patents, including two that relate to Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”). U.S. Patent No. 6,438,124 was developed by the Company, and encompasses the technology that allows two parties to

converse phone-to-phone, regardless of the distance, by transmitting voice/sound via the Internet. U.S. Patent No. 6,243,373 (the “VoIP Patent”) was purchased from a third party (the “Vendor”). These patents, together with related international patents and patent applications, formed the Company’s international VoIP Patent Portfolio (the “Portfolio”) that covered the basic process and technology that enable VoIP communication as used in the market today. As part of the consideration for the acquisition of the VoIP Patent, the Vendor is entitled to receive 35% of the net earnings from the Portfolio.  The Company completed the sale of the Portfolio during the third quarter of 2016 for $0.1 million, and fulfilled all remaining obligations to the Vendor.  
 Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 46 employees: 25 are employed by HGP, 15 by NLEX, and six by Equity Partners.  
 Industry and Competition
 The Company’s asset liquidation business consists primarily of the auction, appraisal and asset advisory services provided by HGP, mergers and acquisitions advisory services provided by Equity Partners, and the accounts receivable brokerage services provided by NLEX. It also includes the purchase and sale, including at auction, of industrial machinery and equipment, real estate, inventories, accounts receivable and distressed debt. The market for these services and assets is highly fragmented. To acquire auction or appraisal contracts, or assets for resale, the Company competes with other liquidators, auction companies, dealers and brokers. It also competes with them for potential purchasers, as well as with equipment manufacturers, distributors, dealers and equipment rental companies. Some competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition. 
 The Company’s business strategy includes the option of partnering with one or more additional purchasers, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively, “Joint Ventures”). These Joint Ventures give the Company access to more opportunities, helping to mitigate some of the competition from the market’s larger participants and contribute to the Company’s objective to be the leading resource for clients requiring capital asset solutions.
 Government Regulation
 We are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Many jurisdictions also regulate "auctions" and "auctioneers" and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
 Legislation in the United States, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, has increased public companies’ regulatory and compliance costs as well as the scope and cost of work provided by independent registered public accountants and legal advisors. The mandatory adoption of XBRL reporting in 2011 has also increased the Company’s costs paid to third party service providers. As regulatory and compliance guidelines continue to evolve, we expect to continue to incur costs, which may or may not be material, in order to comply with legislative requirements or rules, pronouncements and guidelines by regulatory bodies.

The SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains periodic reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, which file electronically with the SEC.
