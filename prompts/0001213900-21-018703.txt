ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Company History
 
Andina Gold Corp (“Andina Gold” or the “Company”) began as Auto Tool Technologies Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011. The Company’s name was changed to AFC Building Technologies Inc. effective January 10, 2014. Effective April 26, 2018, the Company changed its name to First Colombia Development Corp. Effective October 14, 2019, the Company changed its name to Redwood Green Corp. Effective September 1, 2020, the Company changed its name to Andina Gold Corp.
 
In April 2018 the Company effected a forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one (1) old for two (2) new basis. Upon effect of the forward split, authorized capital increased from 250,000,000 shares of common stock to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, the issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 34,760,008 to 73,520,016 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001. The stock split was subsequently reviewed and approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on April 26, 2018.
 
On May 10, 2018, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding share capital of First Colombia Devco S.A.S. (“Devco”), a Colombian company, and began to establish various business ventures in Colombia in the agriculture and real estate development, tourism, and infrastructure sectors before commencing to phase them out in April 2019.
 
On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in General Extract, LLC (“General Extract”), a Colorado limited liability company. General Extract was founded in 2015 as an importer, distributor, broker and postprocessor of hemp and hemp derivatives. The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests, including business plans and access to contacts.
 
On July 15, 2019, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Good Acquisition Co., entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire the intellectual property rights to certain cannabis brands and other assets of Critical Mass Industries LLC DBA Good Meds (“CMI” and/or “Good Meds”), a Colorado limited liability company (“CMI Transaction”). CMI is licensed by the Marijuana Enforcement Division of Colorado Department of Revenue to produce cannabis and cannabis products under its six licenses. These licenses allow for cultivation, manufacturing of infused products and retail distribution. At the time the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, Colorado law prohibited public companies, including the Company, from owning cannabis licenses. Therefore, CMI spun off certain assets acquired by the Company. Under the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, CMI retained the cannabis license, inventory and accounts receivable (the “Cannabis License Assets”) and has continued to operate the cannabis business related to those assets. In consideration for the transfer of the acquired assets, the Company delivered 13,553,233 shares of the Company common stock, in addition to $1,999,770 in cash to CMI. An additional 1,500,000 shares of Andina Gold common stock were held and retained by the Company until the Cannabis License Assets can be divested (see Note 2 and Note 7).
 
Good Meds, the operating unit of CMI, is based in Denver, CO, and operates in a 60,000-square-foot cultivation and processing facility. Good Meds also owns and operates two medical cannabis dispensaries located in Lakewood, CO and Englewood, CO. The business has been in operation since 2009. The Denver facility produces cannabis for sale as dry flower and biomass input for processing into Marijuana-Infused Products (“MIP”), such as live resin, wax and shatter.  Andina Gold derives its primary revenue from the agreements entered into through the CMI Transaction (see Note 2).
 
In August 2020, the Company established a wholly owned Colombian subsidiary, Andina Gold Colombia SAS. This action was taken because the management had identified potential business opportunities in Colombian gold exploration. Also, in August 2020, the Company merged with its wholly owned Nevada subsidiary, Andina Gold Corp., and changed its name to Andina Gold Corp. On October 21, 2020 FINRA issued an advisory accepting the company’s name change from Redwood Green Corp to Andina Gold Corp and ticker symbol change to AGOL effective as of October 22, 2020 at the opening of the U.S. OTC market. However, following a determination that the Colombian gold exploration opportunities the Company examined in Q4 2020 were rendered impracticable on the short and medium term due to the COVID-19 international travel situation, local pandemic-related restrictions and due to the demise of the Company’s local expert, the Company is now exploring other opportunities to preserve and enhance shareholder value.

The Company has been actively pursuing divestiture of its Colorado-based subsidiaries, assets and receivables. To that end, on August 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with CMI and certain CMI subsidiaries intending to transfer the beneficial ownership of the CMI cannabis licenses from the respective CMI subsidiaries to Andina Gold’s subsidiary, Good Meds Inc, with a view to immediately divest them to unrelated parties. The Asset Purchase Agreement had, among other, as a condition precedent to closing, the Colorado Department of Revenue, State Licensing Authority, finding of suitability for Owner-Entity applications for the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Good Meds, Inc. As disclosed on form 8-K on March 4, 2021, on February 26, 2021 the Company received from the Colorado Department of Revenue, State Licensing Authority, a Notice of Denial in the matter of suitability for Owner-Entity applications for the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Good Meds, Inc. The Department of Revenue advised the Company that, pursuant to subsection 24-4-104(9), C.R.S., the Company has the right to request in writing a hearing regarding the denial of the Company’s applications within 60 days from the certified date of service of the Notice of Denial. The issuance of the Notice of Denial may negatively impact ongoing and proposed business transactions with respect to certain Company assets in Colorado, which the Company will attempt to renegotiate in a different structure in good faith. There can be no assurance that the potential counterparties to those transactions will reach an agreement on terms of definitive agreements or that the potential Colorado asset sale transactions will be completed as currently contemplated or at all. As of the date of this filing, the Company is renegotiating certain potential divestiture transactions and the CMI Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
On February 25, 2021 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with CryoCann USA Corporation (“CryoCann”), a California company headquartered in Santa Ana, California, for a proposed asset purchase transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”). CryoCann is a designer and seller of equipment developed on the basis of patented technology for cannabis harvesting, refinement, and extraction. The technology reduces processing costs, increases the quality of the extracted compounds and has potential for other agricultural applications including hemp and hops. The purchase would include all physical and intellectual assets of CryoCann.
 
This opportunity was identified and negotiated following a determination that the Colombian gold explorations opportunities the Company examined in Q4 2020 were rendered impracticable on the short and medium term due to the COVID-19 international travel situation, local pandemic-related restrictions and due to the demise of the Company’s local expert.
 
The following is a summary of the key terms of the proposed transaction as contemplated by the LOI. The proposed transaction remains subject to completion of a due diligence review by the Company, the Company’s Board of Directors approval of the Proposed Transaction, the Company’s ability to secure financing for the Proposed Transaction and the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. There can be no assurance that the parties will reach agreement on the terms of the definitive agreements, or that the proposed transaction will be completed as currently contemplated, or at all.
 

● | Subject to the satisfaction of various conditions described in the LOI, at the closing of the Proposed Transaction the Company would acquire all legal right, title and interest to all CryoCann assets, including all intellectual property held or licensed, free of any encumbrances or liabilities (the “Assets”), and all relevant agreements to which CryoCann is a party that refer to, or are relevant to, the Assets will be assigned to the Company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upon closing of the Proposed Transaction, and as a condition precedent to closing, two employees and shareholders of CryoCann will enter into employment and earn-out agreements for a minimum of three years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Proposed Transaction consideration consists of $4,500,000 in cash at Closing to be paid by the Company to CryoCann and to be distributed among CryoCann shareholders as such shareholders will agree among themselves; $2,000,000 in initial working capital to be made available by the Company on a rolling/as needed basis to the Company division that will manage the Assets; 12,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company to be provided to CryoCann shareholders to be distributed among CryoCann shareholders as such shareholders will agree among themselves, and the execution of the employment and earn-out agreement referenced above.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the LOI, CryoCann undertook, among other, to an exclusivity period until the agreed termination of the LOI (“Exclusivity Period”). During the Exclusivity Period, CryoCann shall not initiate, solicit, entertain, negotiate, accept or discuss, directly or indirectly, any proposal or offer from any person or group of persons other than the Company and its affiliates (an “Acquisition Proposal”) to acquire all or any portion of CryoCann and/or the Assets, whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise, or provide any non-public information to any third party in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Proposed Transaction with the Company.

Overview
 
Andina Gold Corp provides marketing, IP and management services to two cannabis dispensaries and to a cannabis grow facility, for which cannabis licenses are held by Andina Gold Corp’s principal business partner, CMI.
 
CMI is based in Denver, CO, and operates in a 60,000-square-foot cultivation and processing facility. Good Meds also owns and operates two medical cannabis dispensaries located in Lakewood, CO and Englewood CO. The business has been in operation since 2009. The Denver facility produces cannabis for sale as dry flower and biomass input for processing into Marijuana-Infused Products (“MIP”), such as live resin and wax. On average, this facility harvests 2,100 plants per month, representing multiple strains for both for medical use and recreational use. The MIP lab, housed in the Denver facility, currently conducts 84 production runs per month, averaging 34 kilograms of concentrate product. Dry flower and concentrate products are sold in the dispensaries under the Good Meds and BOSM brands, respectively. These products are supplemented by third party suppliers to increase variety available to our customers. Excess concentrate and flower inventory is sold to wholesale customers across the state of Colorado.  
 
The Company has determined to sell all of the assets related to its Good Meds Colorado subsidiaries as well as any business and accordingly such assets are now accounted for on the basis of assets held for sale, pending negotiation of potential transactions with various Colorado-based parties.
 
The Company is now exploring other opportunities to preserve and enhance shareholder value. On February 25, 2021 the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with CryoCann USA Corporation (“CryoCann”), a California company headquartered in Santa Ana, California, for a proposed asset purchase transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”). CryoCann is a designer and seller of equipment developed on the basis of patented technology for cannabis harvesting, refinement, and extraction. The technology reduces processing costs, increases the quality of the extracted compounds and has potential for other agricultural applications including hemp and hops. The purchase would include all physical and intellectual assets of CryoCann (see section above for additional detail).

Marijuana Industry Overview 
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds.” The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp. 
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”) and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately four meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”), which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC. 
 
As of December 2020, there are a total of 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. Of these states, 15 have decriminalized adult use cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision. 
 
These 35 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.

Decriminalization is generally defined as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally defined as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source. 
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana-related businesses in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, as banks can still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, there is widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating legally within state and local laws. 
 
Colorado has approved marijuana use for adults over the age of 18 (and minors with parental consent) with a physician’s recommendation (“medical use”) and for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s recommendation (“adult use”), and has permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. CMI has obtained the necessary permits and licenses to cultivate and distribute marijuana for medical use in compliance with the laws in the State of Colorado. Despite the changes in state laws, marijuana remains illegal under federal law. 
 
The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. 
 
We are monitoring the positions of the Biden administration, the DOJ and Congress on federal marijuana law and policy. In recent years, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government’s approach to cannabis. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in Colorado, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Colorado laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
