We work with several independent licensors for whose intellectual property we compete with other manufacturers. Rights to such intellectual property, when acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the licensor a royalty on our net sales of the item. These license agreements, in some cases, also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees to maintain technical rights and exclusivity. In January 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the VE Technology rights.
 
GasPT®

Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV GL, Orbital Energy Group owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a gas quality inferential measurement device designed by DNV GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT. The Company has minimum commitments, including royalty payments, under this licensing contract.
 
The GasPT, is a low-cost solution for measuring natural gas quality. The customary method for determining the properties of natural gas has traditionally been Gas Chromatography (GC). This time-tested methodology is a versatile and historically established technology; however, its conservative format has rooted a number of issues and problems. GasPT’s unique combination of features enables it to eliminate the anachronisms found in traditional gas properties analyzers to provide plug and play type easy installation, requiring no utility or carrier gas or calibration, and virtually no maintenance, while providing accredited industry standard accuracy with near real time and continuous analysis that enhances sampling frequency, 
 
 The GasPT includes Class A OIML R140 and Class 1 Div2 Fiscal approvals and Class1 Div 2, Zone 1, ATEX, IECEx and CSA Hazardous Area approvals.
 
When connected to a natural gas system GasPT provides a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties of the gas, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z). An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
 
This innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil & Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US, ENGIE (the French energy giant), and NMi & The International Organization of Legal Metrology (‘‘OIML’’). There are instruments like gas chromatographs (‘‘GC’’) that technically can be considered competition, but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT.

GasPTi - combined GasPT and VE Technology Solution
 
The GasPTi, combines the two patented technologies of GasPT and VE Technology which provides a re-engineered approach to natural gas sampling and analysis. Through the combination of the fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of natural gas utilizing the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE Technology that can provide a gas sample from a high-pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital Gas Systems has created the GasPTi metering system.
 
The GasPTi metering system can accurately provide nearly real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds. It provides this analysis at a fraction of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.

BioMethane
 
From its inception Orbital Gas Systems has been involved in the control of BioMethane, or renewable natural gas to grid. In fact, our background in environmental and renewables analysis goes back more than 30 years to protecting basic landfill gas generators.
 
BioMethane gas (produced wherever organic material is decaying) can be, and is a significant source of environmentally-friendly, carbon neutral energy throughout the world. The specific advantages of BioMethane as a source of energy is that it uses already-existing pipeline infrastructure to quickly and efficiently deliver energy to the end-user, who, in most cases, is already connected to the grid.
 
Orbital Gas System’s recognized expertise in energy measurement, process control and odorization offered a complete package that led to designing, building and instigating the very first UK BioMethane-To-Grid system.
 
Today, Orbital Gas System’s BioMethane systems range from basic monitoring through complete “flange-to-flange” solutions that include:
 

• | Energy measurement;

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, Orbital Energy Group, Inc., with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 284 employees. This is an increase in total employees from the 257 total employees reported as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, none of its employees are represented by a labor union which is a decrease from the 73 union employees at its former operation CUI-Canada at December 31, 2019. Most of the increase in employees relates to the acquisition and development of Orbital Solar Services and growth of Orbital Power Services operations during 2020 offset by the sale and closure of its remaining discontinued Power and Electromechanical segment operations. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company may add additional staff as needed to handle all phases of its business.
Intellectual Property Protection
 
The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products, logos and services. These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners. The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
 
Under the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement, which maintains the international register and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, we and our subsidiaries actively maintain up to date the following trademarks: Orbital Solar Services, Reach Construction Group, Orbital Power Services, Eclipse Foundation Group, Orbital Renewables, GasPT, IRIS, and Orbital Gas Systems.
 
The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up-to-date protection of its intellectual property.
 
For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could cause the Company’s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and highly competitive wherein Orbital Energy Group competes with other contractors, from small local independent companies to large national firms, in most of the geographic markets in which we operate. Several competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate such as technical expertise, high safety rating requirements, operational experience and quality, and financial resources. However, organizations that have adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements with price often a primary factor in placing the project, as such we could be underbid by our competitors. We believe that as demand for our services increases, customers often consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including technical expertise and experience, safety ratings, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors such as us. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Many of our customers are able to perform their own infrastructure services similar to the work we provide. Although these companies currently outsource a significant portion of these services, there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future or that they will not acquire additional in-house capabilities.
