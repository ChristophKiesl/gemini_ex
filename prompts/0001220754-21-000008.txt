Item 1. Business.
Overview

ModivCare Inc. is a technology-enabled, healthcare services company, which provides a suite of integrated supportive care solutions for public and private payors and their patients. Its value-based solutions address the Social Determinants of Health, or SDoH, enable greater access to care, reduce costs, and improve outcomes. ModivCare is a leading provider of non-emergency medical transportation, or NEMT, personal and home care, and nutritional meal delivery. Our technology-enabled operating model includes NEMT core competencies in risk underwriting, contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transport management. The Company also partners with communities throughout the country, providing food-insecure individuals delivery of nutritional meals. Additionally, its personal and home care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and skilled nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. 
ModivCare’s solutions help health plans manage risks, close care gaps, reduce costs, and connect members to care. With the combination of its historical NEMT business with its in-home personal care business that was previously operated by Simplura Health Group, as described further below, ModivCare has united two complementary healthcare companies that serve similar, highly vulnerable patient populations. Collectively, ModivCare is uniquely positioned to remove the barriers of health inequities and address the SDoH. 
ModivCare also holds a 43.6% minority interest in CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operates under the Matrix Medical Network brand and which we refer to as “Matrix”. Matrix maintains a national network of community-based clinicians who deliver in-home and on-site services, and a fleet of mobile health clinics that provide community-based care with advanced diagnostic capabilities and enhanced care options. Matrix’s Clinical Care provides risk adjustment solutions that improve health outcomes for individuals and financial performance for health plans. Matrix’s Clinical Solutions provides employee health and wellness services focused on improving employee health with worksite certification solutions that reinforce business resilience and safe return-to-work outcomes. It’s Clinical Solutions also provides clinical trial services which support the delivery of safe and effective clinical trial operations by going where the patients are and ensuring all eligible volunteers, including those with barriers to healthcare access. 
Our Development
ModivCare Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1996 and which recently announced its name change and rebranding from its original name: The Providence Service Corporation. The Company completed its initial public offering, or IPO, of its common stock in August 2003 and its shares have been listed for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or NASDAQ, since its IPO. ModivCare’s shares of common stock currently trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “MODV”; prior to its name change, its shares traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “PRSC”.
ModivCare has grown its business since its IPO into the company it is today through organic growth as well as a series of acquisitions and divestitures of companies operating primarily in related, or tangentially related, industries, as follows with respect to our continuing operations: 
•In December 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Charter LCI Corporation, the parent company of LogistiCare, Inc. (now ModivCare Solutions, LLC), which formed the foundation of our NEMT business and NEMT Segment operations, for cash and 418,952 shares of our common stock totaling approximately $220.0 million; 
•In October 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Matrix for cash and common stock totaling approximately $390.7 million, and subsequently in October 2016, affiliates of Frazier Healthcare Partners (Frazier) obtained a 53.2% majority interest in Matrix through a stock subscription, and we received a distribution from Matrix totaling approximately $381.2 million;
•In September 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding equity not already owned by us of Circulation, Inc., which extended our business to include an NEMT technology platform that allows for real time notifications to members on their mobile devices, integration with a wide variety of advanced traffic management systems, or ATMS, and transportation network companies, real time ride tracking, network management and analytics, for cash totaling approximately $45.1 million; 
•In May 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of National MedTrans, LLC, or NMT, which expanded our NEMT business to include more than five million trips to its approximately two million members on behalf of state Medicaid agencies and MCOs across 12 states, for cash totaling approximately $80.0 million; 
•In November 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of OEP AM, Inc., a Delaware corporation doing business as Simplura Health Group, or Simplura, which formed the foundation of our personal care business and Personal Care Segment operations, for cash totaling approximately $575.0 million subject to certain customary adjustments; and 
as follows with respect to our recently discontinued operations: 
•In November 2015, we sold to Molina Healthcare, Inc. our operations comprising our former human services segment, which provided counselors, social workers and behavioral health professionals to work with clients, primarily in the clients’ homes or communities, who were eligible for government assistance due to income level, disabilities or court order, for cash totaling approximately $200.0 million; and
•In three separate transactions effected in October 2017, July 2018 and December 2018, we ultimately sold to three separate and unaffiliated entities substantially all of our operations comprising our former workforce development services, or WD Services, segment, which provided workforce development services to long-term unemployed, disabled, and unskilled individuals, as well as individuals coping with medical illnesses and those that had been released from incarceration, for cash totaling approximately $15.8 million, a de minimus amount, and $46.5 million, respectively (any operations remaining after these acquisitions have been assumed by other parties or have been discontinued and are being wound down). 
In addition to the acquisition and divestiture activities described above, the Company:
•In May 2017, ceased reinsuring through its wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Social Services Providers Captive Insurance Company, or SPCIC, its automobile, general and professional liability and workers’ compensation costs;
•In January 2019, completed an organizational consolidation in which it closed its corporate offices in Stamford, Connecticut and Tucson, Arizona, and consolidated all activities and functions performed at the corporate holding company level into its NEMT Segment, which we refer to as our Organizational Consolidation;
•In June and September 2020, effected a series of transactions pursuant to an agreement with Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P. and/or funds and accounts managed by Coliseum Capital Management, LLC (collectively, the “Coliseum Stockholders”) in which (1) the Company repurchased approximately half of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Coliseum Stockholders, and (2) the Coliseum Stockholders converted the remaining portion of their holdings of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock for aggregate consideration of $88.7 million; following the September repurchase of the Coliseum Stockholders’ remaining shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company elected to convert all shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by holders other than the Coliseum Stockholders into Common Stock, with the result that we currently have outstanding equity composed only of Common Stock; 
•In May and October 2020, further amended its amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of August 2, 2013 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), to, among other things, increase to $225.0 million the revolving credit limit under the Credit Agreement, permit the issuance of our Notes (as described immediately below), and extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to August 2, 2023;
•In November 2020, issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in November 2025, which we refer to as our Notes, the net proceeds from which were used to finance a portion of the purchase price paid in the Simplura acquisition; and
•In December 2020, formed with an industry counterpart a protected series (90% of which is owned by us and which we refer to herein as our insurance captive) of a captive insurance company, NEMT Insurance DE LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that has been organized subject to the Delaware Revised Captive Insurance Company Act, which has been established to provide an insurance coverage alternative for transportation providers who are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain required automobile insurance in connection with their NEMT services on terms acceptable to them, or at all. 
Our Strategies 
Six pillars fuel and align the six key strategies for our business. Our pillars support our foundation and the strategies that we have established to build shareholder value and guide our operations, product and service delivery model, and ultimate success with our customers and members. 
•Right People in the Right Seats – ensuring that each person is in the role that best fits the person’s skills and capabilities
•Voice of the Customer – creating a best-in-class experience for our customers and members
•Transformational Growth – growing to be one of the nation’s preeminent SDoH companies
•Single Repeatable Model – standardizing and being more customer-centric across each contact center
•Enhanced Technology Platform – rollout of in-demand product that brings the best capabilities of our technology platform
•Rebranding – defining our company’s mission, vision, and values and tying them to our external and internal brand
Utilizing these six pillars as guiding principles, our mission is to provide effective and quality services and logistics and to create shareholder value by pursuing and implementing the following key strategies.
Centers of Excellence – Operations and Local Focus 
Our operational structure includes six centers of excellence, or COEs, that are designed to enhance the visibility, flexibility and control we have over our operations. These COEs are: 
•Transportation Network, which is focused on increases to capacity and improvements to quality designed to reduce cost and enhance the member experience; 
•Contact Center Operations, which is aimed at improving employee productivity through activities such as contact center workflow standardization, cross training and intensive operations management; 
•Client Services, which is focused on local operations and holistic approaches to our customers and client retention; 
•Technology, which is focused on the support of operations and development of proprietary technology to elevate the member experience and differentiate our product; 
•Growth, which is focused on sales, marketing and business development; and 
•Process Improvement, which is designed to support all of our other COEs in the pursuit of effective and efficient operations.
In addition to the COE oversight structure, we have implemented controls and procedures at the local level to better manage costs and our transportation network. We believe this structure positions us for effective scalability of our business model while also ensuring that the nuances of local activity are taken into account in controlling costs, which when combined, provide us with a competitive advantage.
Technology Transformation 
In August 2020, we launched a new front-end member technology platform in targeted markets that is intended to leverage rider benefits on the front-end with all of the payor benefits, including reporting, on the back-end. We expect this technology platform will reduce inbound calls from members looking for assistance on the location of the transportation provider, improve on-time percentages and enhance member satisfaction. Specifically, we believe this new front-end platform will provide revenue growth and also the following additional benefits:
•member communications through texting, email and automated calls, including the ability for the member to see the location of the transportation provider in real time on a mobile device;
•proactive management for rejected, canceled and late rides; and
•driver application enhancements for transportation providers. 
Customer and Member Satisfaction
Transportation related to care is one of the most impactful experiences contributing to our clients’, members’ and patients’ satisfaction during their care encounter. At the core of our operational and technology strategies is a focus on driving client and member satisfaction. With respect to our Personal Care Segment, process improvements, augmented by technology, are expected to help reduce costs while maintaining quality patient care. In addition, we strive to become the employer of choice in each of our Personal Care Segment markets. Our scale and density in these markets allow us to provide the number of weekly work hours our caregivers desire, which gives us a competitive advantage in recruiting and retention of caregivers that might otherwise need to work for several agencies to obtain the desired number of work-hours. More generally, our COE operational structure allows us to develop locally tailored network solutions with a higher level of visibility. Greater access to 
real time information, enabled through our technology, provides us the ability to shorten cycle times to identify and resolve client and member issues. 
Organic Growth 
•NEMT Segment. Across the healthcare market, we see an increasing understanding of the benefit of removing transportation as a barrier to care and a way to improve other determinants of health, such as access to food, shelter, socialization, and pharmacy. We believe that our scale, deep experience, operational strategy, and technology uniquely position us to address customer needs related to transportation of vulnerable populations. We approach sales, marketing and business development in a manner that is focused on driving market share in our core Medicaid market, including states and MCOs, Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans, health systems and providers. Simultaneously, we target business development efforts with partners to enter new transportation markets, including the movement of home health providers, pharmacy delivery and beneficiaries of workers compensation. We expect there will be network effects as we serve more and more healthcare constituencies within a geography.
•Personal Care Segment. We intend to continue to grow in our existing markets for personal care services by: 
◦enhancing the breadth of our services; 
◦increasing the number of referral sources; 
◦leveraging and expanding existing payor and referral source relationships; and 
◦opening de novo sites where appropriate. 
Our business development activities in this area include community outreach in each of our markets, where we educate referral sources about the benefits of personal care services and the programs available to patients. We believe that demographic trends such as an aging population and longer life expectancies will increase the size of our addressable market, and that the demand for in-home personal care will further increase because it is the lowest cost setting and therefore preferred by payors and also by patients, who also tend to prefer their own homes over institutional settings. We also believe that the carve-in of personal care into MA provides further opportunity for organic growth. As one of the largest platforms providing in-home personal care, we differentiate our services by providing broad geographic coverage in both urban and rural areas and the capability to offer a broad suite of services and manage complex cases involving high-needs patients. In addition, we are working with MCOs and other payors to lower overall cost of care and improve outcomes by managing risk factors, such as falls, and using technology solutions to provide early indicators of change in condition to avoid hospitalization. With these capabilities, we strive to be the provider of choice for in-home personal care services and intend to continue differentiating our services from the competition and winning market share by relying on strong regional leadership, clinical capabilities, qualified and well-trained caregivers and investment in technology.
Inorganic Growth 
•NEMT Segment. We closely follow our core NEMT market and expansion markets mentioned above. We believe our experience, relationships in the industry, scale and executive team strongly position us to be a consolidator in healthcare transportation. Our acquisition strategy may include an evaluation of new entrants, which may not be able to otherwise compete without the benefits of scale and experience, and closely-held businesses that may seek a new capital structure or sale to achieve liquidity for founders. With our balance sheet, strong team and track record, we believe we are a natural consolidator.
•Personal Care Segment. We believe there is a significant opportunity for continued growth through acquisition in both new and existing personal care services markets. The personal care services industry is highly fragmented, and smaller competitors are finding it increasingly difficult to compete as payors look to narrow their provider networks and contract with providers of scale that can offer a wide breadth of services and capabilities across a broad geographic area. Moreover, smaller competitors may not have the capital to invest in technology and lack the market density to attract caregivers. We will continue to explore opportunities to acquire regional providers to enter into new markets, and tuck-in acquisitions to grow our presence in existing markets, as well as to branch out into adjacent businesses.
Smart Capital Allocation
Our NEMT Segment has historically generated positive cash flows, our Personal Care Segment has experienced consistent growth, a strong free cash flow profile, and maintains an asset-light model similar to our NEMT Segment, and our combined balance sheet provides us with optionality with respect to capital allocation and how we can best deliver shareholder value. We will continue to focus on operational efficiencies, invest in our operations, and seek to enhance our technical capabilities through technological initiatives in an effort to enhance our client and member experience. In respect of our 
Personal Care Segment, we are committed to maintaining and improving the quality of our patient care by dedicating appropriate resources at each site and continuing to refine our clinical and non-clinical initiatives and objectives. We are implementing technology enhancements and service protocols intended to promote best practices, enhance the patient experience, and improve the operating effectiveness and efficiency of our case management, training, staffing, scheduling and labor management. We will also continue to assess the opportunities for capital deployment in order to create value for shareholders, which may include dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.
Our Operations
We are a technology-enabled, healthcare services company that is the nation’s largest manager of NEMT programs for state governments and MCOs, and also a leading in-home personal care services provider in the seven eastern states where we provide those services. Our core competencies in NEMT include contact center management, network credentialing, claims management and non-emergency medical transport management. Our in-home personal care services include placements of non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and skilled nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including senior citizens and disabled adults. 
By offering our suite of integrated supportive care solutions for our payor customers and members, we are focused on becoming among the nation’s preeminent SDoH companies. We report our operations as described above under three separate business segments: NEMT; Personal Care; and Matrix, each of which is described below in greater detail following the next subsection captioned “Business Trends”. 
Business Trends
Our performance is affected by a number of trends that drive the demand for our services. In particular, the markets in which we operate are exposed to various trends, such as healthcare industry and demographic dynamics. Over the long term, we believe there are numerous factors that could affect growth within the industries in which we operate, including:
•an aging population, which is expected to increase demand for healthcare services and transportation and, accordingly, in-home personal care services; 
•a movement towards value-based versus fee-for-service and cost plus, or FFS, care and budget pressure on governments, both of which may increase the use of private corporations to provide necessary and innovative services;
•increasing demand for in-home care provision, driven by cost pressures on traditional reimbursement models and technological advances enabling remote engagement, including telehealth services;
•technological advancements, which may be utilized by us to improve services and lower costs, but may also be utilized by others, which may increase industry competitiveness; and
•MCO, Medicaid and Medicare plans increasingly are covering NEMT services for a variety of reasons, including increased access to care, improved patient compliance with treatment plans, social trends, and to promote social determinants of health, and this trend may be accelerated or reinforced by President Trump's recent signing into law of The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 ("H.R.133"), a component of which mandates that state Medicaid programs ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have necessary transportation to and from health care providers.
We estimate the overall size of the U.S. NEMT Medicaid market, in terms of annual spend, to be approximately $4.3 billion. Each year, approximately 5.8 million Medicaid members are estimated to miss out on medical care due to lack of transportation. NEMT solutions enable access to care that not only improves the quality of life and health of the patients receiving services, but also enable many of the individuals to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings. In addition, studies have shown that missed medical appointments lessen patient compliance with clinical guidelines and lead to increased complications and expensive medical services. Moreover, preventive care has proven to lower the cost of overall care by avoiding potentially more serious, costly emergent services later. NEMT providers also cater to individuals with specialized transportation requirements, representing 16% of total NEMT rides. 
We estimate the overall size of the U.S. personal care services market, in terms of annual spend, to be approximately $55.0 billion, and it is expected to grow annually by 9% to 14% to $100.0 billion by 2024. The U.S. personal care services market also benefits from the strong underlying trends of aging demographics and a shift toward value-based care, which is moving care away from more expensive institutional settings and into the home. Many consumers in this segment need services on a long-term basis to address chronic conditions. Payors establish their own eligibility standards, determine the type, amount, duration and scope of services, and establish the applicable reimbursement rate in accordance with applicable law, regulations or contracts. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, personal care service providers lower the cost of treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings, such as nursing homes that we believe can cost more than two times more than equivalent 
personal care services. In addition, caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of patients for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the patient’s conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, personal care also is designed to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.
Personal care services are a significant component of home and community-based services, which have grown in significance and demand in recent years. Demand for personal care services is expected to continue to grow due to the aging of the U.S. population, increased life expectancy and improved opportunities for individuals to receive home-based care as an alternative to institutional care. The population of 65 and older nationally has been consistently growing and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that starting in 2030, when all baby boomers will be older than 65, Americans 65 years and older will make up 21% of the population, up from 15% today.
The personal care services industry developed in a highly fragmented manner, with few large participants and many small ones. Few companies have a significant market share across multiple regions or states. We expect ongoing consolidation within the industry, driven by the desire of payors to narrow their networks of service providers, and as a result of the industry’s increasingly complex regulatory, operating and technology requirements. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on a consolidating industry given our reputation in the market, strong payor relationships and integration of technology into our business model.
NEMT Segment

We provide NEMT solutions to our clients, including state governments, MCOs and health systems, in 50 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 28.7 million eligible members received our transportation services, and in 2020, we managed approximately 48.2 million gross trips. 
We primarily contract with state Medicaid programs and MCOs, including MA plans, for the coordination of their members’, who are our “end-users”, NEMT needs. Our end-users are typically Medicaid or Medicare eligible members, whose limited mobility or financial resources hinders their ability to access necessary healthcare and social services. We believe our transportation services enable access to care, as well as access to food, shelter, socialization, and pharmacy, that not only improves the quality of life and health of the populations we serve, but also enables many of the individuals we serve to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings. We provide access to NEMT on a more cost effective basis than self-administered state Medicaid or MCO transportation programs while improving the lives and health outcomes of the populations we serve. 
To fulfill the transportation needs of our end-users, we apply our proprietary technology platform to an extensive network of approximately 5,700 transportation resources. This includes our in-network roster of fully contracted third-party transportation providers who operate sedans, wheelchair equipped vehicles, multi-passenger vans and ambulances. Our system also utilizes partnerships with on-demand transportation network companies, mass transit entities, mileage reimbursement programs, taxis and county-based emergency medical service providers. To promote safety, quality and compliance, our in‑network transportation providers undergo an in-depth credentialing and education process.
Our transportation management services also include fraud, waste, and abuse prevention and identification through utilization review programs designed to monitor that our transportation services are provided in compliance with Medicaid and Medicare program rules and regulations as well as to remediate issues that are identified. Compliance controls include ongoing monitoring, auditing and remediation efforts, such as validating end-user eligibility for the requested date of service and employing a series of gatekeeping questions to verify that the treatment type is covered and the appropriate mode of transportation is assigned. We also conduct post-trip confirmations of attendance directly with the healthcare providers for certain repetitive trips, and we employ field monitors to inspect transportation provider vehicles and to observe transports in real time. Our claims validation process generally limits payment to trips that are properly documented, have been authorized in advance, and are billed at the pre-trip estimated amount. Our claims process is increasingly digital, which provides more protection to member protected health information and reduces the impact on the environment. Transportation providers are able to submit their bills and supporting documentation directly to us through a secured web portal.
•Customers. In 2020, contracts with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs represented approximately 49.3% and 50.7%, respectively, of NEMT Segment revenue. The NEMT Segment derived approximately 9.5%, 12.7% and 12.6% of its revenue from a single state Medicaid agency for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The next four largest NEMT Segment customers by revenue comprised in the aggregate approximately 21.6%, 19.7% and 21.4% of NEMT Segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Contracts with state Medicaid agencies are typically for three to five years with multiple renewal options. Contracts with MCOs continue until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice in accordance with the terms of the contract and allow for regular price adjustments based upon utilization and transportation cost. As of December 31, 2020, 22.0% of NEMT Segment revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that are subject to renewal within the next 12 months. While we typically expect to renew these contracts on an annual basis, we did receive notice from three customers that they were terminating or not renewing their contracts that expired on September 30, November 30 and December 31, 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded revenue of $40.6 million for these contracts.
The NEMT Segment generated 86.2% of its revenue in 2020 under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements based on per-member per-month, or PMPM, fees for the number of eligible members enrolled in the customer’s program for a flat-fee for the contract period. Revenue is recognized as services are provided, based on the population served during the period. Profitability for these contracts is largely driven by the extent to which actual utilization meets or exceeds expected utilization at the time of contract pricing. Under certain capitated contracts, known as reconciliation contracts, partial payment is received as a prepayment during the month service is provided. These prepayments are periodically reconciled to actual utilization and costs and may result in refunds to the customer, or additional payments due from the customer. The remaining 13.8% of NEMT Segment revenue was generated under other types of fee arrangements, including administrative services only and FFS, under which fees are generated based upon billing rates for specific services or defined membership populations.
•Development Efforts and New Product Offerings. The delivery of our NEMT program is dependent upon a highly integrated platform of technology and business processes as well as the management of a multifaceted network of third-party transportation providers. Our technology platform is purpose-built for the unique needs of our industry and is highly scalable: capable of supporting substantial growth in our clients’ current and future membership base. In addition, our technology platform efficiently provides a broad interconnectivity among end-users, customers, and our network of transportation providers. We believe this technological capability and our industry experience position us well as a focal point in the evolving healthcare industry to introduce valuable population insights. We also believe that it will enable us to deliver to our customers and end-users a single repeatable model that standardizes our offerings and is more customer‑centric across each contact center. We provide service offerings and technological features for end-users to improve service levels, lower costs and build the foundation for additional data analytics capabilities. We are continuing to implement a modern, cloud based, interactive, voice responsive automated call distribution and work force management system across all contact centers. Our technology also allows for real time notifications to members on their mobile devices, integration with a wide variety of ATMS and transportation network companies, real time ride tracking, network management and analytics.
•Competition. We compete with a variety of national organizations that provide similar healthcare and social services related transportation, such as Medical Transportation Management, Southeastrans, Veyo, and Access2Care, as well as local and regional providers. Most local competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties or small geographic territories, whereas we and other larger competitors seek to win contracts for an entire state or large regional area. We compete based upon a number of factors, including our nationwide network, technical expertise, experience, service capability, service quality, and price.
•Seasonality. Our quarterly operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season.
Personal Care Segment 
We provide in-home personal care services to our customers with 57 agency branches across seven states, including in several of the nation’s largest home care markets: New York, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Connecticut. We place non-medical personal care assistants, home health aides and skilled nurses primarily to Medicaid patient populations in need of care monitoring and assistance performing daily living activities in the home setting, including persons who are at increased risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill or disabled senior citizens and disabled adults. Our personal care services include bathing, personal hygiene, grooming, oral care, dressing, medication reminders, meal planning, preparation and feeding, housekeeping, transportation services, prescription reminders, and assistance with dressing and ambulation, all of which enable aging-in-place and support overall wellness. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 14,000 trained caregivers throughout all of our branch locations serving, on average, approximately 12,500 patients and providing approximately 21.0 million hours of patient care annually. 
Our Personal Care Segment payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, MCOs, commercial insurers and private individuals. The federal, state and local programs under which these organizations operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. MCOs that operate as an extension of our government payors are subject to similar economic pressures. Our commercial insurance payor clients are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs.
Most of our personal care services are provided pursuant to agreements with state and local governmental aging services agencies, Medicaid waiver programs, and home and community based long-term living programs. These agreements generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated with 60 days’ notice. They are typically renewed in our experience for one to five-year terms, provided that we have complied with licensing, certification and program standards, and other regulatory requirements.
Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and type of service, but are typically fee-for-service based on hourly or other unit-of-service bases. MCOs are becoming an increasing portion of our Personal Care Segment payor mix as states shift from administering fee-for-service programs to utilizing managed care models.
•Development Efforts and New Product Offerings. We do not deploy proprietary technology in our Personal Care Segment, but we have invested in the implementation of the enterprise technology solution Homecare Software Solutions, LLC, which operates under the HHAeXchange brand and which we refer to as “HHAeXchange”, to manage compliance, scheduling, electronic visit verification (or EVV), payroll and revenue cycle. HHAeXchange has been implemented for the majority of our Personal Care Segment business, and additional functionality is being implemented, including “Stop & Watch” monitoring of change in patient condition, care plan reporting via EVV, mobile application self‑service and others. The three MCOs in Pennsylvania selected HHAeXchange to collect confirmed homecare visits, create claims to MCOs and provide workflow efficiency tools, enabling interoperability between our Personal Care Segment operations and the three Pennsylvania MCOs. Additionally, we have implemented the Relias e-learning solutions in select operations, and we continue to roll out the application throughout the segment. Relias e-learning solutions enables required training to be delivered remotely and helps improve utilization by reducing time lost for training.
•Competition. The personal care services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and fragmented. Providers range from facility-based agencies (e.g., day health centers, live-in facilities, government agencies) to independent home care companies. They can be not-for-profit organizations or for-profit organizations. There are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home healthcare services markets in which we operate. We believe, however, that we have a favorable competitive position, attributable mainly to:
◦the consistently high quality and targeted services we have provided over the years to our patients; 
◦our ability to serve complex, high-needs patient populations;
◦our scale and density in the markets we serve;
◦our strong relationships with payors and referral sources; 
◦our investments in technology; and 
◦our compliance protocols and training programs for associates who provide direct care to patients.
•Seasonality. Our quarterly operating income and cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to somewhat lower demand for in-home services from caregivers during the summer and periods with major holidays, as patients may spend more time with family and less time alone needing outside care during those periods. Our payroll expense in the Personal Care Segment is also generally higher during the earlier quarters of the year prior to employees reaching the applicable thresholds for certain payroll taxes, and during periods with major holidays resulting from holiday pay provided by us to our caregivers.
Matrix Investment Segment 
We own a 43.6% non-controlling equity interest in Matrix. We and Frazier, which holds the controlling equity interest in Matrix, are party to a Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, or Operating Agreement, of Mercury Parent, LLC, the company through which the parties hold their equity interests in Matrix. The Operating Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions regarding our ownership, including our indirect ownership of common stock of Matrix, and provides for, among other things, liquidity and governance rights and other obligations and rights, in each case, on the terms and conditions contained in the Operating Agreement. We account for our interest in Matrix under the equity method whereby the Company’s proportionate share of Matrix’s net assets is recorded as equity investment in our consolidated balance sheets and our proportionate share of its financial results are recorded as equity net gain (loss) on investee within our consolidated statements of operations. 
Matrix offers in-home and on-site care optimization services for members, including comprehensive health assessments, or CHAs, through a national network of community-based clinicians and a fleet of mobile health clinics with advanced diagnostics capabilities. As of December 31, 2020, Matrix utilized a national network of approximately 4,200 clinical providers, including 2,500 nurse practitioners, located across 48 states, to provide its services primarily to members of MA health plans. Matrix primarily generates revenue through the performance of CHAs, which seek to confirm a health plan member’s information related to health status, and social, environmental and medical risks, to assist MA health plans in improving the accuracy of such information. Matrix also operates a care management offering which provides additional data analytics, chronic care management services and employee wellness programs.
•Customers. As of December 31, 2020, Matrix’s customers included 59 health plans, including for-profit multistate health plans and non-profit health plans that operate in only one state or several counties within one state, as well as 18 other companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Matrix’s top five customers accounted for 75.3% of its revenue, with its largest customer comprising 23.4% of its revenue and its second largest customer comprising 16.1% of its revenue. Matrix enters into annual or multi-annual contracts under which it is paid on a per assessment basis. Volumes are not guaranteed under contracts, however, and customers may choose to utilize other third-party providers or in-source capabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Matrix generated net income of $15.1 million on a standalone basis, and had $245.7 million of outstanding net debt as of December 31, 2020. 
•Development Efforts and New Product Offerings. Matrix’s services are dependent upon its technology platform which integrates the clinical provider network, operations infrastructure, contact centers and clients. Matrix’s platform is designed for the unique needs of its industry, is highly scalable and can support substantial growth. We believe Matrix’s network and platform position Matrix as a focal point in the evolving healthcare industry in the introduction of both additional population insights and care management services. With data provided by its health plan clients, Matrix utilizes analytics to determine which members it can most effectively lower costs and improve outcomes through face-to-face engagements with clinicians. Each program is customized and is served by a comprehensive team of case managers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and trained contact center colleagues.
•Competition. We believe that Matrix and Signify Health are the largest independent providers of CHAs to the health plan market. There are many smaller competitors, such as EMSI Healthcare Services, MedXM, which is a Quest Diagnostics company, and Inovalon. In addition, some health plans in-source CHA services. Matrix’s chronic care management competitors include Landmark Healthcare, PopHealthCare, which is a GuideWell company, and Optum.
Governmental Regulations
Overview
Our business is subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and agency guidance. These laws significantly affect the way in which we operate various aspects of our business. We must also comply with state and local licensing requirements, state and federal requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, requirements for contracting with MA plans, and contractual requirements imposed upon us by the federal, state and local agencies and third-party commercial customers to which we provide services. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide and be authorized to provide services on an ongoing basis.
The Medicare and Medicaid programs are governed by significant and complex laws. Both Medicare and Medicaid are financed, at least in part, with federal funds. Therefore, any direct or indirect recipients of those funds are subject to federal fraud, waste and abuse laws. In addition, there are federal privacy and data security laws that govern the healthcare industry. State laws primarily pertain to the licensure of certain categories of healthcare professionals and providers and the state’s interest in regulating the quality of healthcare in the state, regardless of the source of payment, but may also include state laws pertaining to fraud, waste and abuse, privacy and data security laws, and the state’s regulation of its Medicaid program. Federal and state regulatory laws that may affect our business, include, but are not limited to the following:
•false and other improper claims or false statements laws pertaining to reimbursement;
•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement and code set regulations and guidance, along with evolving state laws protecting patient privacy and requiring notifications of unauthorized access to, or use of, patient medical information;
•civil monetary penalties law;
•anti-kickback laws;
•Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, and other self-referral, financial inducement, fee splitting, and patient brokering laws;
•The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, regulations pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid as well as CMS releases applicable to the operation of MA plans, such as reimbursement rates, risk adjustment and data collection methodologies, adjustments to quality management measurements and other relevant factors; 
•State Medicaid laws, rules and regulations that govern program participation, operations, the provision of care to Medicaid beneficiaries and the reimbursement for such services; and 
•state licensure laws.
A violation of certain of these laws could result in civil and criminal damages and penalties, the refund of monies paid by government or private payors, our exclusion from participation in federal healthcare payor programs, or the loss of our license to conduct some or all of our business within a particular state’s boundaries. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, allegations that we failed to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal Law and State Laws 
Federal healthcare laws apply in any case in which we provide an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to our customers that results in reimbursement by a federal healthcare payor program to us. The principal federal laws that affect our business include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with federal healthcare payor programs, require confidentiality of patient health information, prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federal healthcare payor programs and those that prohibit physicians from referring to certain entities if the physician has a financial relationship with that entity.
State healthcare laws apply in any case in which we provide an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to our customers that results in reimbursement by a state Medicaid program to us. The principal state Medicaid laws that affect our business include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with state Medicaid programs, prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable by a state Medicaid program and those that prohibit physicians from referring to certain entities if the physician has a financial relationship with that entity. Because we receive Medicaid reimbursement, we are subject to applicable participation conditions including a variety of operational, conflict of interest, and structural obligations. For example, in states that have elected to obtain authority to provide NEMT as a medical service through a broker using the regulatory process permitted by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA, we are prohibited from contracting with any transportation provider with which we have a financial relationship. In addition to Medicaid laws, many states have health care or professional licensure requirements that potentially apply to parts of our business. 
False and Other Improper Claims
Under the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, the government may impose civil liability on us if we knowingly submit a false claim to the government or cause another to submit a false claim to the government, or knowingly make a false record or statement intended to get a false claim paid by the government. The False Claims Act defines a claim as a demand for money or property made directly to the government or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the money is to be spent on the government’s behalf or if the government will reimburse the contractor or grantee. Liability can be incurred for submitting (or causing another to submit) false claims with actual knowledge or for submitting false claims with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance. Liability can also be incurred for knowingly making or using a false record or statement to receive payment from the federal government; for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government; or for knowingly noncomplying with a law or regulation that is material to the government’s decision to pay Medicare or Medicaid claims. Consequently, a provider need not take an affirmative action to conceal or avoid an obligation to the government, but the mere retention of an overpayment from the government could lead to potential liability under the False Claims Act.
Many states also have similar false claims statutes. In addition, healthcare fraud is a priority of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, its program integrity contractors and its Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state Attorneys General. These agencies have devoted a significant amount of resources to investigating healthcare fraud.
If we are ever found to have violated the False Claims Act, we could be required to make significant payments to the government (including damages and penalties in addition to the return of reimbursements previously collected) and could be excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs or providing services to entities which contract with those programs. Although we monitor our billing practices for compliance with applicable laws, such laws are very complex, and we might not be able to detect all errors or interpret such laws in a manner consistent with a court or an agency’s interpretation. While the criminal statutes generally are reserved for instances evidencing fraudulent intent, the civil and administrative penalty statutes are being applied by the federal government in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. Examples of the types of activities giving rise to liability for filing false claims include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting services rendered (i.e., miscoding), applications for duplicate reimbursement and providing false information that results in reimbursement or impacts reimbursement amounts. Additionally, the federal government takes the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary. The federal government also takes the position that claiming reimbursement for services that are substandard is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard. Criminal penalties also are available even in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate any of the federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes.
State Medicaid agencies and state Attorneys General also have authority to seek criminal or civil sanctions for fraud and abuse violations. In addition, private insurers may bring actions under state false claim laws. In certain circumstances, federal and state laws authorize private whistleblowers to bring false claim or “qui tam” suits on behalf of the government against providers and reward the whistleblower with a portion of any final recovery. In addition, the federal government has engaged a number of private audit organizations to assist it in tracking and recovering claims for healthcare services that may have been improperly submitted.
Governmental investigations and whistleblower qui tam suits against healthcare companies have increased significantly in recent years, and have resulted in substantial penalties and fines and exclusions of persons and entities from participating in government healthcare programs. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, allegations that we failed to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Health Information, Privacy and Data Protection Practices
Under HIPAA, DHHS issued rules to define and implement standards for the electronic transactions and code sets for the submission of transactions such as claims, and privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in whatever manner it is maintained.
The Final Rule on Enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions, including the transaction standards, the security standards and the privacy rule, published by DHHS addresses, among other issues, DHHS’s policies for determining violations and calculating civil monetary penalties, how DHHS will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and various procedural issues. The rule extends enforcement provisions currently 
applicable to the healthcare privacy regulations to other HIPAA standards, including security, transactions and the appropriate use of service code sets.
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extends certain of HIPAA’s obligations to parties providing services to healthcare entities covered by HIPAA known as “business associates,” imposes new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations, extends enforcement powers to state Attorneys General and amends the HIPAA privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of HIPAA. HITECH establishes four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation, and a maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision. With the additional HIPAA enforcement power under HITECH, the Office for Civil Rights of the DHHS and states are increasing their investigations and enforcement of HIPAA compliance. We have taken steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA and are monitoring compliance on an ongoing basis.
Additionally, the HITECH Final Rule imposes various requirements on covered entities and business associates, and expands the definition of “business associates” to cover contractors of business associates. Even when we are not operating as covered entities, they may be deemed to be “business associates” for HIPAA rule purposes of such covered entities. We monitor compliance obligations under HIPAA as modified by HITECH, and implement operational and systems changes, associate training and education, conduct risk assessments and allocate resources as needed. Any noncompliance with HIPAA requirements could expose us to criminal and increased civil penalties provided under HITECH and require significant costs in order to comply with its requirements or to remediate potential issues that may arise.
Other state privacy laws may also apply to us, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into force in January 2020. The CCPA affords California residents with specified rights relating to the collection and use of their personal information. Violation of the CCPA may lead to monetary fines, and data breaches may give rise in certain circumstances to private rights of action by impacted individuals. While we believe that our practices are in compliance with these laws, allegations that we failed to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
Federal law commonly known as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value (direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind) which is intended to induce: 
•the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs; or 
•the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any service or item for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs.
Interpretations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have been very broad and under current law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Even bona fide investment interests in a healthcare provider may be questioned under the Anti-Kickback Statute if the government concludes that the opportunity to invest was offered as an inducement for referrals.
This act is subject to numerous statutory and regulatory “safe harbors.” Compliance with the requirements of a safe harbor offers defenses against Anti-Kickback Statute allegations. Failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. It may mean, however, that such an arrangement will be subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authorities.
Many states, including some where we do business, have adopted anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state laws are very closely patterned on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; others, however, are broader and reach reimbursement by private payors. If our activities were deemed to be inconsistent with state anti-kickback or illegal remuneration laws, we could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such activities, any of which could harm us.
If our arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or applicable state laws, we, along with our clients, would be subject to civil and criminal penalties. In addition, implicated contracts may not be legally enforceable, which could materially and adversely affect our business. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, allegations that we failed to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions
We may be subject to federal and state statutes banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from making a “referral” for “designated health services” for Medicare (and in many cases Medicaid) patients from entities or facilities in which such physicians directly or indirectly hold a “financial relationship”.
A financial relationship can take the form of a direct or indirect ownership, investment or compensation arrangement. A referral includes the request by a physician for, or ordering of, or the certifying or recertifying the need for, any designated health services.
Certain services that we provide may be identified as “designated health services” for purposes of the Stark Law. Such segments cannot provide assurance that future regulatory changes will not result in other services they provide becoming subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future.
Many states, including some states where we do business, have adopted similar or broader prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of clients. Moreover, many states where such segments operate have laws similar to the Stark Law prohibiting physician self-referrals. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with these laws, allegations that we failed to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Healthcare Reform Litigation 
On November 10, 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in Texas v. California. In that case, Texas is seeking to invalidate the entirety of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) by arguing that the ACA’s individual mandate is unconstitutional because it is no longer a tax (because Congress changed the tax to zero) and the individual mandate cannot be severed from the rest of the ACA, so the entire ACA is unconstitutional. We are not able to predict the outcome of this matter nor are we able to predict the impact of a full or partial invalidation of the ACA. If the Supreme Court invalidates the ACA, there could be a material change in individual insurance coverage, Medicaid enrollment and reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
Surveys and Audits
Our business is subject to periodic surveys by government authorities or their contractors and our payors to ensure compliance with various requirements. Regulators conducting periodic surveys often provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failures to comply with various regulatory requirements. In most cases, if a deficiency finding is made by a reviewing agency, we will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, an agency may take a number of adverse actions against a program, including:
•the imposition of fines or penalties or the recoupment of amounts paid;
•temporary suspension of admission of new clients to our program’s service;
•in extreme circumstances, exclusion from participation in Medicaid, Medicare or other programs;
•revocation of our license; or
•contract termination.
While we believe that our programs are in compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other program certification requirements and state licensure requirements, the rules and regulations governing Medicare, Medicaid participation and state licensure are lengthy and complex. Allegations that we failed to comply with these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to enter into contracts with other agencies to provide services.
Billing/Claims Reviews and Audits
Agencies and other third-party commercial payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of our claims or other audits in conjunction with obligations to comply with the requirements of Medicare or Medicaid. In order to conduct these reviews, payors request documentation from us and then review that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Any determination that such segments have not complied with applicable rules and regulations could result in adjustment of payments or the incurrence of fines and penalties, or in situations of significant compliance failures review or non-renewal of related contracts.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting
The corporate practice of medicine doctrine prohibits corporations from practicing medicine or employing a physician to provide professional medical services. This doctrine arises from state medical practice acts and is based on a number of public policy concerns, including: 
•allowing corporations to practice medicine or employ physicians will result in the commercialization of the practice of medicine; 
•a corporation’s obligation to its shareholders may not align with a physician’s obligation to the physician’s patients; and 
•employment of a physician by a corporation may interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment. 
Most states in which Matrix operates and in which we provide personal care services prohibit the corporate practice of medicine. Every state provides an exception for physician ownership of a professional corporation. Many states provide an exception for employment of physicians by certain entities. The scope of these exceptions varies from state to state. Corporate practice of medicine doctrine issues can also overlap with kickback and fee-splitting concerns. Some states use the corporate practice of medicine doctrine to limit the services that a manager can furnish to a physician or medical practice because the state is concerned that a manager might interfere with the physician’s independent medical judgment and/or impose an unacceptable intrusion into the relationship between the physician and the patient.
Among other activities, Matrix currently contracts with and employs nurse practitioners to perform CHAs and our Personal Care Segment currently: 
•employs registered nurses and licensed practical nurses to render skilled nursing care directly and to provide overall clinical supervision to patients; and 
•has medical professionals provide guidance to its Quality Improvement Committees. 
We believe that Matrix and our Personal Care Segment have structured operations appropriately. Either or both, however, could be alleged or found to be in violation of some or all of these laws. If a state determines that some portion of the business violates these laws, or that a payment induced a physician to refer a patient, it may seek to have an entity discontinue or restructure those portions of operations or subject the entity to increased costs, penalties, fines, certain license requirements or other measures. Any determination that Matrix or we acted improperly in this regard may result in liability. In addition, agreements between Matrix and the particular professional may be considered void and unenforceable.
Professional Licensure and Other Requirements 
Many of Matrix’s employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their professions. For example, mid-level practitioners (e.g., Nurse Practitioners) are subject to state laws requiring physician supervision and state laws governing mid-level scope of practice. As physicians’ use of mid-level practitioners increases, state governing boards are implementing more robust regulations governing mid-levels and their scope of practice under physician supervision. The ability of Matrix to provide mid-level practitioner services may be restricted by the enactment of new state laws governing mid-level scope of practice and by state agency interpretations and enforcement of such existing laws. In addition, services rendered by mid-level practitioners may not be reimbursed by payors at the same rates as payors may reimburse physicians for the same services. Lastly, professionals who are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as individual providers must not have been excluded from participation in government programs at any time. The ability of Matrix to provide services depends upon the ability of personnel to meet individual licensure and other requirements and maintain such licensure in good standing.
COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Orders 
On January 30, 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services declared a Public Health Emergency, and on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and the National Emergencies Act. In addition, state governors have declared public health emergencies and subsequently issued numerous public health and executive orders. 
These emergency, public health and executive orders have waived numerous legal requirements while also imposing new legal restrictions. Many public health and executive orders are issued, rescinded or modified with little advance notice. These emergency, public health and executive orders have created significant uncertainty in the legal and operational duties of 
health care providers. While we believe that our programs are in compliance with emergency, public health and executive orders, allegations that we failed to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
CARES Act Provider Relief Fund 
The CARES Act established the Provider Relief Fund that made relief payments to certain health care providers. The purpose of the Provider Relief Fund was to provide funding to health care providers so they could prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus. Providers who received relief payments are subject to eligibility criteria and specific terms and conditions on the use of relief payments. To receive relief payments, many providers were required to attest to numerous statements regarding accuracy of their application and their compliance with the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions. Providers’ use of relief payments is limited to health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. Providers are required to have documentation that relief payments were used for those purposes. There is limited guidance concerning what the government might consider a health care related expense or lost revenue that was attributable to coronavirus or what type of documentation is adequate.
Prior to our acquisition of Simplura, it received relief payments from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. While we believe that the receipt and use of relief payments was in compliance with Provider Relief Fund requirements, allegations of a failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Human Capital Management
Attracting, developing and retaining talented people who embrace our culture, execute our strategy, and enable us to compete effectively in our industry is critical to our success. In fact, ensuring that we have the right people in the right seats is one of our six pillars guiding our business strategy.
We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. Our vision statement, “We drive positive health outcomes by transforming the way we connect to care” gets to the core of everything we do. We aim to attract and retain great people – representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills – who work together as a cohesive team by embodying the following values:
Because we care….
–We treat everyone with dignity and RESPECT;
–We earn the TRUST of our members and each other;
–We provide RELIABLE services that open doors;
–We serve with courtesy and COMPASSION;
–We prioritize SAFETY; and
–We communicate with purpose and TRANSPARENCY……… always.
Our ability to recruit and retain our employees depends on a number of factors, including providing competitive compensation and benefits, development and career advancement opportunities, and a collegial work environment. We invest in those areas in an effort to ensure that we continue to be the employer of choice for our employees.
Compensation and Benefits
Our benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, protect their income and help them have harmony between their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, broad-based bonus programs, pension and retirement savings plans, career growth opportunities, and a culture of recognition.
Employee Development and Advancement 
We invest significant resources to develop employees with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our strategy. We seek to ensure that we are building the organizational capabilities required for success in the years to come. We offer employees and their managers a number of tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, including an in-house continuing education program. We also have a practice of investing in our next generation of leaders and offer employees a number of leadership development programs. We believe in and encourage our employees and managers to maintain a growth 
mindset, a belief that qualities and talents can be developed through dedication and hard work, and have aligned our performance management programs to support our culture transformation with increased focus on continuous learning and development.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 17,500 employees, of which approximately 3,500 were dedicated to our NEMT Segment and 14,000 were dedicated to our Personal Care Segment. Approximately 1,400 of our Personal Care Segment caregivers (about 10% of our caregivers) were unionized in New York at the end of 2020, and we believe that we have good relationships with all of our employees. 
Demographics and Diversity
Our employees reflect the communities in which we live and work, and the customers we serve, and they possess a broad range of thought and experiences that have helped us achieve our successes to date. A key component of our growth and success is our focus on inclusion and diversity. We believe this commitment allows us to better our understanding of patient and customer needs, and develop technologies and solutions to meet those needs. Although we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation, we continue to seek to improve in this important area. We have established goals to continue improving our hiring, development, and retention of diverse employees and our overall diversity representation, including within our executive management team, in an effort to be a socially responsible community member.
In response to COVID-19, we took action to protect our employees’ health and safety, including by equipping employees with personal protective equipment, establishing minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitizing workspaces more frequently, adopting alternate work schedules and instituting other measures aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19 while sustaining productivity on behalf of our customers and their patients. In addition, we implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely, allowing a significant portion of our workforce to begin teleworking in mid-March 2020 and continuing to do so through December 31, 2020.
