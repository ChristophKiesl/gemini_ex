Overview
 
Quanta is an applied science company focused on increasing energy levels in plant matter to increase performance within the human body. Our proprietary technology uses quantum mechanics to increase bio-activity of targeted molecules to enhance the desired effects. We specialize in potentiating rare naturally occurring elements to create impactful and sustainable healing solutions that we believe will one day be as powerful and predictable as pharmaceutical drugs.
 
We offer our technology as a platform, making it accessible to existing high-quality product makers with existing distribution channels, as well as consumer products. Our mission is to power as many impactful, high-performing and wholly organic solutions as possible through product lines and a series of licensing and distribution partnerships.
 
Bioanomaly Inc. was founded in 2016 by a group of technology and industry entrepreneurs and provides licensed technology solutions to natural product companies in multiple verticals. Our headquarters is located in Burbank, California.
 
Quanta Basics
 
Quanta, Inc. (“Quanta”) is a cutting-edge technology platform whose patented, proprietary technology harnesses advances in quantum biology to increase the potency of active ingredients. Currently, Quanta supports product formulations in pain management, anti-inflammation, skincare, agriculture, nutritional supplements, and plant-based consumables. Ultimately, Quanta’s mission is to deliver better, more effective ingredients to elevate product efficacy, reduce waste and facilitate healthier, more sustainable consumption.
 
The established resonance theory behind Quanta’s polarization process has many potential applications. From potentiating bio-ingredients to produce more-effective carbon-trapping plants to transformative anti-aging solutions Quanta’s technology has the opportunity to upend how commercial products are made and the benefits from them. Already we see multi-trillion-dollar global industries benefiting from Quanta’s technology.
 
Our proof of concept, Quanta’s market-leading CBD pain-relief rub (“Muscle Rub”), is only the first in a series of paradigm shift products to emerge from our labs. At the heart of its well-documented effectiveness is our proprietary “polarization” process, which uses electromagnetic force to markedly enhance bioactivity at the molecular level—a polarized active ingredient is more soluble and creates stronger bonds with the body’s receptors. This allows us to enhance ingredients so they work faster and more powerfully without the use of chemical by-products or cellular penetration. Quanta believes this natural solution has nearly limitless applications in the world of plant-based consumer products.

Quanta is involved in ambitious projects that we believe will reshape the next wave of climate science, sustainability, nutrition, and more. Having harnessed the technology of the future, Quanta is dedicated to bringing tomorrow’s health and wellness solutions to the billions in need today.
 
Proof of Concept
 
Creating, producing and selling consumer products was never our primary focus; Quanta’s Muscle Rub was simply a means to an end - proof of concept and a revenue driver in a small emerging market as our business model took shape. Fundamentally, Quanta will be a licensing concern designed to collaborate with large brands to improve product quality and the profit margins of existing and new products. But the market needed proof and we chose to start in the under-developed category of CBD because of its speed to market.
 
Understandably, we met the same initial hurdles every start-up encounters. In addition to simply explaining quantum mechanics, we had no track record of success from a business standpoint. The immediate goal was to prove our model was defensible. Hence, we chose CBD as a launch category. This market provided protection from industry titans that may have felt threatened by such a powerful technology while allowing us to drive profits during R&D.
 
Over the last two years, we have developed and sold products largely to the medical industry, along with some consumer retail. This effort was designed to drive revenue and to prove the concept of our model: that polarizing a single ingredient can produce a demonstrably superior product that consumers find safe and effective (establish consumer appetite).
 
Discovery Synopsys
 
Using our product development process and business-to-business and direct-to-consumer sales approaches as a benchmark for future business, we developed the Quanta business model. Our technology’s unique ability to strengthen ingredients renders them more potent without added chemicals or penetrating cells means Quanta is in a first-of-its-kind position in the market. As the world’s first company focused on Quantum Biology we sit in a strong, but unique position in the market.
 
Our ability to increase ingredient efficacy by up to 500% means we are in a rare position to truly disrupt many areas of material science.
 
Quanta’s technology renders products superior to any on the market today. A 30% re-purchase rate (on one SKU alone) illustrates consumer appetite for the product.
 
Upcoming products and ventures will be designed to achieve or surpass this level of consumer benefit and uptake.
 
Quanta Business Model in 3 P’s: Potentiation, Partners, and Profits
 
After two years we believe the best possible model for the long-term success of the company is collaborating with best-in-class partners through joint ventures for new verticals, products, and research. These joint ventures may involve a jointly owned special purpose entity or they may be entirely based on contractual obligations.
 
Our mission has never been to create the best novel products on the planet. Our mission has always been to revolutionize the way formulations are developed and how products perform. We seek to work with the best product makers in the world to positively impact as many industries as possible.
 
The unique ability to increase the ingredient and product performance opens the doors for major opportunities. Higher performing ingredients mean less is needed to make a strong impact (increased margins, increase overall efficacy). We proved this with our Muscle Rub, which uses approximately 1/3 the CBD of competing products with demonstrably improved results.

The level of potentiation delivered by Quanta allows our partners the unique ability to provide higher-performing products, lower material costs, more competitive pricing and increased profit margins. In short, our partners will be able to make better performing, more affordable products with a higher repeat purchase. This is true disruption and consumer utopia.
 
We aim to work with groups that specialize in manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing existing product lines that utilize ingredients we can potentiate. Partners like this facilitate efficient market delivery of joint innovations.
 
We believe this strategy provides greater shareholder value, enhances revenue potential, defrays upfront expenses and affords us the ability to raise capital for new projects without massive dilution.
 
Ultimately, these ventures would result in licensing out our technology to other reputable brands and companies to create co-branded products whereas the term “Powered by Quanta” becomes as recognized as “Intel Inside.”
 
We believe this type of partnership will afford a company Quanta partners with:
 

● | Development of emerging products with cutting edge ingredients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A product line with a true point of differentiation. 
● | New SKUs with an increased margin. 
● | Decreased cost of goods sold. 

 
Simultaneously these partnerships will allow Quanta:
 

● | Greater brand recognition. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increased revenue and in turn profitability. 
● | Quicker timeline to more licensing opportunities because of a track record of success. 
● | Brand to become synonymous with improving the performance of ingredients within products. 

Manufacturing Partnerships -
 
Quanta is currently focused on partnering with large-scale manufacturers and distributors able to produce products that meet the requirements of applicable regulations IE: Good Manufacturing Practices to fulfill orders of our own product line. This type of partnership is crucial because it will afford:

● | New product development that meets certification requirements 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Much larger production scale 
● | Speed to market 
● | Increased distribution and profitability 

 
With our licensing capabilities, Quanta technology can render better, more efficacious products that cost less to create but command a higher purchase value because of polarized ingredients. This, in turn, allows companies to diversify their catalog of products while simultaneously providing them with a distinguished advantage. More efficacious ingredients.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, Quanta has 21 full time and 2 part time employees. We believe we enjoy good employee relations. None of our employees are members of any labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
