Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We have been engaged in the retail and wholesale distribution of a wide spectrum of food and beverage products in Guangdong province, China since 2011. We have eight stores in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province to serve our clients and we have developed our online platform for our wholesaler and other end users. In addition, we are actively seeking quality target companies in the food, beverage and alcohol industries for mergers and acquisition for further development of our company.
Corporate History and Structure
 
Fortune Valley Treasures, Inc., formerly Crypto-Services, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 21, 2014. We were initially incorporated to offer users with up-to-date information on digital currencies.
 
On July 22, 2015, we filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from Crypto-Services, Inc. to Fortune Valley Treasures, Inc.
 
On December 14, 2016, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with DaXingHuaShang Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles (“DIGLS”), and its shareholders. DIGLS is engaged in the business of retail and wholesale of imported wine products in China and owns all of the equity capital of DaXingHuaShang Investment (Hong Kong) Limited (“DILHK”), Qianhai DaXingHuaShang Investment (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“QHDX”) and Dongguan City France Vin Tout Ltd. (“FVTL”). Pursuant to the Original Agreement, we agreed to issue 300,000,000 shares of our common stock to the stockholders of DIGLS in exchange for 100% of the shares of DIGLS. On April 11, 2018, we entered into a termination agreement with DIGLS, terminating the Original Agreement and all transactions contemplated under the Original Agreement. On April 6, 2018, we entered into a share exchange agreement by and among DIGLS, and each of the shareholders of DIGLS, pursuant to which we issued 300,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued shares of DIGLS. The share exchange closed on April 19, 2018 and DIGLS became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
During the year 2020, in order to increase our wine market share, FVTL set up two subsidiaries, namely “Dongguan City Fu La Tu Trade Ltd (FLTT)” and “Dongguan City Fu Xin Gu Trade Ltd (FXGT)” in Dongguan City.
 
On March 1, 2019, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of Jiujiu Group Stock Co., Ltd. (“JJGS”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles, in exchange for 100 shares of our common stock and closed the acquisition of JJGS on March 1, 2019. After the closing, JJGS became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. JJGS owns all of the equity interest of Jiujiu (HK) Industry Limited (“JJHK”) and Jiujiu (Shenzhen) Industry Co., Ltd. (“JJSZ”). JJGS and JJHK are holding companies and conduct business through their operating subsidiary, JJSZ, which engages in retail and wholesale distribution of our wine products.
 
On June 22, 2020, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement along with Qianhai DaXingHuaShang Investment (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a company incorporated in China and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FVTI (“QHDX”), to acquire 90% of the shares of Dongguan Xixingdao Technology Co., Ltd. (“Xixingdao”), a company incorporated in China, in exchange for 4,862,681 shares of our common stock and closed the acquisition of Xixingdao on August 31, 2020. After the closing, Xixingdao became the Company’s subsidiary. The shares were issued to the original owners of Xixingdao on December 28, 2020. Xixingdao’s principal business is drinking water distribution and delivery in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. To increase its market share, Xixingdao set up eight subsidiaries primarily operating wholesale distribution of our water products to serve the local customers.

Recent Developments
 
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in China and has since spread rapidly globally. The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. In 2020, COVID-19 had a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. including, but not limited to, the following:

● | We temporally closed our offices in early 2020, as required by relevant PRC regulatory authorities. Our offices were subsequently reopened pursuant to local guidelines. In 2020, the pandemic caused disruptions in our operations and supply chains, which resulted in delays in the shipment of products to certain of our customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A large number of our employees were in mandatory self-quarantine and the entire business operations of the Company halted for over a month from February to March 2020. 
● | Our customers were negatively impacted by the pandemic, which reduced the demand of our products. As a result, our revenue and income were negatively impacted in the first half of 2020. 



After the second quarter of 2020, the COVID outbreak in China has gradually been controlled. Our business has also returned to normal operations, although management assessed that our results of operations had been negatively impacted for the year. COVID-19 could adversely affect our business and results of operations in 2021 if any COVID resurgence causes significant disruptions to our operations or the business of our supply chain, logistics and service providers. We cannot predict the severity and duration of the impact from such resurgence, if any. If any new outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, or if government responses to outbreaks or potential outbreaks are severe or long-lasting, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Business Plan
 
Our business plan is to extend our market share through acquiring quality businesses in the food and beverage industries, in order to increase our customer base and supply channels, as well as to acquire more skilled employees and business connections in the industries. We plan to further develop our online marketing platform and internal operation management system by engaging an external IT company during 2021. In the past year, we successfully acquired Xixingdao, a drinking water distribution business. While we terminated proposed acquisitions of two target companies as a result of their inability to meet our performance requirements, as disclosed below, we are in the process of completing the acquisition of Valley Holdings, a food wholesale and food additives business. We expect to continue to explore new opportunities to acquire additional quality and compatible businesses in our industries.


We consider the following factors when evaluating quality acquisition targets: (i) costs involved in an acquisition; (ii) financial performance of the target; (iii) the reputation of the target in its industry; (iv) the target’s existing customer base; (v) the target’s supplier network; (vi) the expertise and experience of the target’s management and employees; and (vii) the inventory condition of the target.
 
Our management believes that successful acquisitions will bring synergies to our business and enhance our shareholders’ value.

Our Business, Products and Product Distribution
 
We sell a variety of wines, such as dry red wine, dry white wine, rosé wine, and sweet wine. Currently we sell about 40 different brands of wine, most of which are imported from France and Spain.
 
We sell a variety of water, peanut oil, soybean oil and blended oil. Currently we sell about 30 different brands of water and 3 different brands of oil.
 
We have put significant efforts in developing and promoting our brand name in different regions of China. Our products are mainly sold to retailers, such as wine and water retail stores, convenience stores and supermarkets. The selling price varies by quantities of products each retailer orders from us.


We have cultivated business relationships and achieved recognitions with different organizations over the years, which have improved our business and management efficacy. Specifically, we have been collaborating with Shenzhen Institute of Tsinghua University since 2011, who has been helping us develop an innovative management model, operating model and franchising model. We have been a member of Guangdong Provincial Liquor Industry Association since 2011.
 
Our wine product operations are based in Humen Town, Dongguan City. We lease a six-floor building with a total floor area of 1,200 square meters. Our wine retail store is located on the first floor which we use exclusively as a retail store and for sample products display. We use the remaining five floors as the Company’s conference room, offices and storage.
 
Our water and oil product management office is also located in Humen Town, Dongguan City. We lease the building which has over 1,300 square meters. It includes sales, customer service, warehouse, delivery and finance departments. The office manages one office, seven wholesales stores and one warehouse. We also maintain one registered office for the subsidiary with lease term of three years. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has total twelve separate operating lease agreements for three office spaces, one warehouse and eight stores in PRC with remaining lease terms of from 21 months to 76 months.
 
We have developed our WeChat applet “FVTI food safety & healthy supply platform” (short name “Fu Gu Online”). Some of our agents and wholesalers have ordered from this platform.


Market
 
China is a country with both an ancient wine tradition and a new and an emerging wine-consuming market. Wine production in China has thousands of year of history. Today, China is also an emerging wine-producing nation in its own right with brands such as Great Wall, Changyu and Dynasty. Local wines account for 80 percent of wine consumed in China. According to The International Wine and Spirit Record (the “IWSR”), China is one of the fastest-growing wine markets in the world, with rising personal incomes driving an enhancement of tastes and consumption levels. In 2017, the wine consumption per capita was only about 1.2 liters accounting for less than 1/3 of the global total as well as 1/10 of the U.S. consumption. Therefore, we believe there are great potential for growth in the Chinese wine market.
Competition
 
France still dominates the Chinese wine market with a share of 48 per cent according to Euromonitor International. The best sales in Chinese supermarkets are imported wines from RMB60-180, or approximately $9.00 - $27.00 per bottle. One major challenge is that Chinese consumers switch from one brand to another rather quickly, exhibiting little brand loyalty. Online sales particularly enable the consumers to source and purchase budget wines. Management believes that wineries will most benefit from growth in China will be those that demonstrate patience, professional service while building brand awareness and a long term strategy to develop the market with their Chinese partners.
 
For our Company, there are two major competitors in our market, Aussino Liquor and ASC Fine Wines. These companies are well established, more recognized and well accepted by consumers in China.
