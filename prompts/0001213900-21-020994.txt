ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Legacy Education Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on November 23, 2010 in Nevada under the name Streamline Resources, Inc. Our name was subsequently changed to Priced In Corp (“PRCD”) on April 24, 2012. Prior to the merger discussed below, we were a shell corporation with nominal operating activity. 
 
On November 10, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of such date the (“Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) PRCD, a Nevada corporation, (ii) Priced In Corp. Subsidiary, a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PRCD (“PRCD Sub”), (iii) Tigrent Inc., a Colorado corporation (“TIGE”), and (iv) Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc., a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIGE (“Legacy Holdings”). On November 10, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PRCD Sub merged with and into Legacy Holdings (the “Merger”), with Legacy Holdings surviving the Merger and becoming our wholly owned subsidiary and we acquired the business of Legacy Holdings.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”):
 

● | PRCD amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which included an increase in our authorized stock to 220 million shares (200 million shares of common stock and 20 million shares of preferred stock); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PRCD changed its name from “Priced In Corp.” to “Legacy Education Alliance, Inc.”; 
● | All of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Legacy Holdings outstanding at the Effective Time were converted and exchanged into 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and were held by TIGE.

 
As a result of the Merger, TIGE owned approximately 80% of Legacy with the then remaining outstanding shares (3,997,500) held by the existing PRCD shareholders.
 
There was no cash consideration exchanged in the Merger. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, PRCD agreed to pay TIGE taxes and related liabilities and other specified costs and expenses, including certain administrative and related expenses that have been or will be from time to time incurred by TIGE that are related to TIGE’s investment in PRCD (including the cost of preparing and distributing reports regarding our business and financial condition to its shareholders), its administrative costs and expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes arising from dividends or distributions by us to TIGE. All shares of PRCD common stock issued in connection with the Merger are restricted securities, as defined in paragraph (a) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Such shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated there under.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization since, immediately following the completion of the transaction, the holders of TIGE’s stock had effective control of PRCD. In addition, TIGE controlled the surviving entity through control of Legacy’s Board of Directors as a result of the appointment of the existing directors of TIGE to the four board seats of Legacy. Additionally, all of TIGE’s officers and senior executive positions continued on as management of the surviving entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes, Legacy Holdings was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of PRCD. Accordingly, Legacy Holdings’ assets, liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the registrant, and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with PRCD effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. Prior to the Merger, PRCD was a “shell” corporation with nominal assets, liabilities and operating activity. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.
 
On February 14, 2017, TIGE completed the distribution of 15,998,326 shares of Common Stock in Legacy approved by the Board of Directors of TIGE on October 4, 2016. Pursuant to the distribution, 1.00105 shares of Legacy Common Stock were distributed for each share of stock held in TIGE. 
 
For a further discussion of the Merger and its effects on our business, please see the information contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on November 10, 2014 and the related amendments thereto.
 
We voluntarily filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 12, 2017, and Amendment No 1 to Form 10 on June 27, 2017, to register our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On July 11, 2017, we announced that the filed Form 10 Registration Statement was effective on that day. A copy of the Form 10 Registration Statement is available on the Company’s website at (http://ir.legacyeducationalliance.com/all-sec-filings).

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to be the leading provider of services and products that enable individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their current economic situation and educational background, to take control of their financial futures and enable them to achieve financial freedom.
 
Our strategy is focused primarily on the following areas:
 

● | Continued development of our businesses. We will continue our focus on our service offerings in an attempt to improve our revenue and expand our offerings as appropriate, including e-learning and other electronic format offerings and the development of new proprietary brands. In November 2020, the Company shifted its focus to its Legacy EducationTM products, with Building Wealth with LegacyTM as the new flagship brand, which encompasses hands-on experience and the true spirit of investing from beginner to educated investor, within a community of like-minded individuals. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development of higher-margin proprietary brands. Since November 2020, shifted its focus to developing proprietary brands, which have no royalty and other associated costs, but will require us the Company to market in new and innovative ways. This will allow us the flexibility to provide our services through different demographics, price points and sales channels, and to develop additional complementary products and services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fulfilling our customer obligations. We intend to improve the cost efficiency with which we fulfill our customer commitments. We have:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanded the options for course fulfillment in order to reduce the number of expired contracts by increasing the number of courses offered through electronic media and via the internet; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Implemented an improved outreach program that involves contacting our customers to help them manage their course schedules; 
● | During Q4 2019, we transitioned from Symposiums to Legacy Investor Forums (Forums). The Forums are live events that provide a learning and building experience for the novice to expert investor. Forums deliver business advancement to attendees through education and offer an arena for attendees to discover new relationships with companies, as well as their fellow investors. In December 2019, we held our first virtual symposium where we presented various advanced classes, student networking opportunities, and third-party sales opportunities via livestream to create the look and feel of a live symposium through the use of digital delivery methods. 


● | Enhanced eLearning . We continue developing and promoting interactive and online distributed course content and enhanced technology platforms capable of streaming video, interactive e-learning, and distributed e-learning.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consistent quality assurance . We believe that to be an effective provider of training we need to ensure that our course offerings meet our strict quality assurance guidelines. We will continue to monitor and enforce standards for marketing, sales presentations, and training delivery throughout our organization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued professional development. We will continue to identify, recruit and retain a team of trainers, mentors and coaches who possess practical, hands-on experience in their areas of expertise.

Recent Developments
 
Impact from COVID-19 Coronavirus.
 
Historically, our operations have relied heavily on our and our students’ ability to travel and attend live events where large groups of people gather in local markets within each of the segments in which we operate. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. As a result of worldwide restrictions on travel and social distancing, in March 2020 we temporarily ceased conducting live sales and fulfillment and furloughed substantially all of our employees. We resumed sales operations in June 2020 with online sales events selling into our suite of online, on-demand, and over-the-phone products. We also resumed online, on-demand, and over-the-phone fulfillment activities in June 2020. We resumed live operations in November 2020, with events in Florida. The Company expects to conduct additional live events in other areas as lockdown restrictions continue to ease and hopes to return to a normal schedule over the coming months. The Company will continue following strict safety protocols at the live events. We have simplified our product offerings and restructured our compensation program with respect to both employees and independent contractors to reduce costs and improve margins, but there can be no assurances that the Company will be effective in selling its products and services, or what the impact such activities will have on our financial performance.
 
The ultimate impact from COVID-19 on the Company’s operations and financial results will depend on, among other things, the ultimate severity and scope of the pandemic, the pace at which governmental and private travel restrictions and public concerns about public gatherings will ease, the rate at which historically large increases in unemployment rates will decrease, if at all, and the speed with which the economy recovers. We are not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on our financial results, but expect developments related to COVID-19 to continue to affect the Company’s financial performance in 2021 and beyond.
 
Changes in Management and Board of Directors
 
On March 8, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) elected Michel Botbol, 61, as a Director, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On the same date, the Board appointed James E. May, 66, as General Counsel of the Company, a position he held prior to his appointment as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company in January 2019. Upon the assumption of his position as General Counsel, Mr. May resigned as Director and Chief Executive Officer.
 
Senior Secured Convertible Debt Agreement
 
On February 11, 2021 the Company entered into a non-binding term sheet with Legacy Tech Partners, LLC (LTP). The term sheet includes a Debenture Agreement of $375 thousand, with 10% per annum interest rate. The Debenture may be converted at any time after the issue date into shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Conversion Shares”) at a price equal to $0.05 per share. Together with each Conversion Share, a warrant will be issued with a strike price of $0.05 per share and an expiration date of five years after issuance. The term sheet anticipates entering into a share purchase agreement whereby LTP will acquire for nominal consideration the existing business, assets and liabilities of the Company (the “Spin-Off”), while the Company will enter into a license agreement with LTP to retain rights with respect to certain of its intellectual property for the benefit of building an Education Technology (“EdTech”) business. This transaction will be subject to stockholder and regulatory approval and other conditions.
 
On March 8, 2021, the Company issued a $375 thousand Senior Secured Convertible Debenture (“Debenture”) to Legacy Tech Partners, LLC (“LTP”) a Delaware limited liability company. The Debenture accrues interest at a rate of 10% and is due on the earlier of the occurrence of certain liquidity events with respect to the Company and March 8, 2022. The Debenture may be converted at any time after the issue date into shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Conversion Shares”) at a price equal to $0.05 per share. Together with each Conversion Share a warrant will be issued with a strike price of $0.05 per share and an expiration date of March 8, 2026 (the “Warrants”). LTP has an obligation to lend the Company an additional $625 thousand under the same terms prior to March 31, 2022, and an option to fund an additional $4 million under the same terms prior to March 8, 2024. LTP also has the option to extend the maturity date of each loan it makes to the Company, including the initial loan of $375 thousand for a term not to exceed four years from the original maturity date of that loan. Net proceeds were $314 thousand after legal fees related to the transaction. The Debenture is secured by a lien on all the Company’s assets. The Company’s U.S. subsidiaries entered into Guaranties on March 9, 2021 in favor of LTP under which such subsidiaries guaranteed the Company’s obligations under the Debenture and granted LTP a lien on all assets of such subsidiaries. The use of proceeds from the Debenture will be to extinguish liabilities of the Company and to fund the development of the EdTech (as defined above) business. The Warrants will not be listed for trading on any national securities exchange. The Warrants and the shares issuable upon conversion of the Debenture are not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The aggregate number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Debenture and upon the exercise of the Warrants may not exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares upon conversion of the Debenture and the exercise of the Warrants.

Business Overview
 
We are a provider of practical, high-quality, and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate investing strategies and techniques. Our programs are offered through a variety of formats and channels, including free workshops, basic trainings, forums, telephone mentoring, one-on-one mentoring, coaching and e-learning. In October 2019, we launched our new proprietary line of training, mentoring and coaching products to support our students through every phase of their journey with us, from beginner to experienced investor. In December 2019, we held our first virtual (online) symposium and our first Legacy Investor Forum. In November 2020, we held our first live post-COVID events.
 
Since December 31, 2019, we have operated under two brands:



● | Homemade Investor by Tarek El MoussaTM introduces people to the investor mindset, real estate investing strategies, and ways to generate cash flow that are designed to help build a foundation of knowledge for their financial goals. Homemade Investor events offered nationwide free workshops, 3-day trainings and large stage events with Tarek presenting as the keynote speaker, all selling into our advanced training products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Building Wealth with Legacy TM: provides practical, high-quality and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate, financial markets and investing strategies and techniques. This training program encompasses hands-on experience and the true spirit of investing from beginner to educated investor. In response to the limitations on travel and the social distancing protocols arising out of the Coronavirus pandemic, the Company began marketing its Legacy EducationTM products transitioning to brand name Building Wealth with LegacyTM. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our students pay for their courses in full up-front or through payment agreements with independent third parties. Under United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we recognize revenue upon the earlier of (i) when our students take their courses or (ii) the term for taking their course expires, both of which could be several quarters after the student purchases a program and pays the fee. We recognize revenue immediately when we sell our (i) proprietary products delivered at time of sale and (ii) third party products sales. Our symposiums and forums combine multiple advanced training courses in one location, allowing us to achieve certain economies of scale that reduce costs and improve margins while also accelerating U.S. GAAP revenue recognition, while at the same time, enhancing our students’ experience, particularly, for example, through the opportunity to network with other students.

We also provide a richer experience for our students through one-on-one mentoring (two to four days in length, on site or remotely, although we have suspended providing on-site mentorships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) and telephone mentoring (10 to 16 weekly one-on-one or one-on-many telephone sessions). Mentoring involves a subject matter expert interacting with the student remotely or in person and guiding the student, for example, through his or her first real estate transaction, providing a real hands-on experience.
 
We were founded in 1996, and through a reverse merger, became a publicly-held company in November 2014. Today we are a global company that has cumulatively served more than two million students from more than 150 countries and territories over the course of our operating history.
 
Historically, our operations have relied heavily on our and our students’ ability to travel and attend live events where large groups of people gather in local markets within each of the segments in which we operate. As a result of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and the resulting worldwide restrictions on travel and social distancing, we temporarily ceased conducting live sales and fulfillment and furloughed substantially all of our employees. We resumed online operations in July 2020, and live operations in November 2020. The Company expects to conduct additional live events as lockdown restrictions continue to ease and hopes to return to a normal schedule over the coming months. The Company will continue following strict safety protocols at the live events. We have simplified our product offerings and restructured our compensation program with respect to both employees and independent contractors to reduce costs and improve margins, but there can be no assurances that the Company will be effective in selling its products and services, or what the impact such activities will have on our financial performance. We are not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on our financial results, but expect developments related to COVID-19 to continue to affect the Company’s financial performance in 2021 and beyond.
 
Our operations are managed through three operating segments: (i) North America, (ii) United Kingdom, and (iii) Other Foreign Markets.
 
The proportion of our total revenue attributable to each segment is as follows:
 

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
---------------------------------+--------------------------+------
As a percentage of total revenue | 2020 | | | 2019
North America | | 70.3 | % | | 72.1 | %
U.K. | | 3.1 | % | | 5.5 | %
Other foreign markets | | 26.6 | % | | 22.4 | %
Total consolidated revenue | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %

 
Operating results for the segments are as follows:
 

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
---------------------------+--------------------------+-------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | 
Segment revenue | (In thousands) | 
North America | $ | 24,001 | | $ | 54,427
U.K. | | 1,058 | | | 4,128 
Other foreign markets | | 9,102 | | | 16,941
Total consolidated revenue | $ | 34,161 | | $ | 75,496

Marketing
 
Our various brands are the foundation for our marketing efforts. These brands provide credibility and sustainability within our media mix to promote live events and online trainings. Live onsite two-hour free preview workshops are offered weekly in multiple markets in North America. Marketing these events is primarily done online through social media posts, internet banner ads, text ads, and emails. Direct mail, radio, television, public relations, and print advertising may also be used to obtain event registrations. We enter into marketing and other agreements with third parties to advertise our products and services.
 
We offer people the opportunity to attend a free preview workshop or advance directly to one of our three-day basic training classes. People who enroll and attend the basic training class receive reference materials relevant to the subject matter to be taught at the class. The basic training course is usually held over a weekend within two to four weeks of the initial free preview workshop. Our experience is that offering the free preview workshop as a first step is an effective way to introduce to our students the methodology of investing, as well as to market and sell our three-day basic training courses.
 
Marketing efforts continue to those customers who choose to continue their education with a three-day basic training class. Welcome letters, product kits that include manuals, books and audio files, an online reference library, and reminder communication letters and emails are all branded for consistency and credibility. Customers at the three-day basic training may choose to continue on with their education through our elite training classes and mentorships offered during the basic training classes.
 
We utilize different preview brands to market into our advance training division, which we re-branded to Elite Legacy Education to expand our market reach. Elite training classes are fulfilled through various delivery methods to meet the needs of our customers.
 
We also market for new customers who prefer to learn online and provide people the opportunity to attend free ninety-minute live online webinars that are held weekly on six different topics. Webinars are marketed via online banner ads, affiliate marketing, email campaigns, social media and other media methods.
 
Training Programs
 
We have three significant categories for our programs:
 

● | Basic training live and online courses, 
--+--------------------------------------------------
● | Elite level live and online training courses, and
● | Individualized mentoring programs.

The goal of our fulfillment strategy is to provide maximum flexibility to the students to allow them take any of their classes in whatever format, and in any combination of formats, that works best for them. Students may access training content through multiple delivery channels, including:
 

● | Live Classroom: In-person “one-on-many” intensive 3-day class with a live instructor and any number of students in the same room, at a symposium, a forum or as a stand-alone class.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Live Stream: Interactive real-time streaming of a Live Classroom training that may be viewed by a student remotely via the internet. Live stream classes can be reviewed for 30-days post-class.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Live On-Line: Live presentations of a class in modules presented over a period of weeks with a live instructor and any number of students in any number of locations who attend remotely via the internet. Student has access to recordings of the modules for 30 days after the last live session.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On-Demand: Class that is presented in self-paced pre-recorded modules via internet link with 24/7 access for the life of the contract. Unlike the three “live” fulfillment options, which require the student to attend classes when LEAI schedules them, the On-Demand Options provides the student the flexibility to take the class whenever they want, and as many times as they want, during the life of the student’s contract.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Through strategic partners, customers can purchase a license to use supporting software for real estate or financial markets investing. With either software program, a subscription-based data service is available for purchase which allows customers to interactively determine investment options and make better informed decisions about potential investments.
 
Individualized Mentoring and Coaching Programs
 
We offer live, real time, one-on-one mentoring for Real Estate, Business and the Financial Markets that are tailored to meet students’ individual goals and needs. Real Estate mentoring is offered on site at the student’s chosen location, while Financial Market mentoring can be provided either on-site or remotely. Mentoring is intended to give the student a professional assessment of his or her individual goals and experience and to help the student build an investment plan that can be put into action. Mentoring sessions are generally 2 to 4 days in length.
 
Coaching and telephone mentoring programs are typically sold in a number of different subject areas and generally delivered in 10 to 16 weekly one-on-one telephone sessions. Some of the topics include Real Estate Coaching, Financial Markets Coaching and Business Coaching. A set curriculum approach is generally used. Each module comes with assignments, exercises and reading materials to be completed between sessions.
 
Geographic Diversification
 
We manage our business in three segments based on geographic location for which operating managers are responsible to the Chief Executive Officer. These segments include: (i) North America, (ii) United Kingdom, and (iii) Other Foreign Markets.
Competition
 
During our more than 20-year history, we have competed with several organizations within the U.S. and internationally. Our primary competitors are Fortune Builders, Armando Montelongo, and Mayflower Alliance Ltd. Some of these competitors have established brands through a media-based relationship, such as HGTV, and use television programs to promote their brands.
 
The main competitors to our financial markets strategies and techniques course offerings are large institutional brokerage houses, who have been offering education as a way to expand their client portfolio.
 
Generally, competitive factors within the proprietary training market include:
 

● | The range and depth of course offerings;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | The quality of trainers;
--+-------------------------


● | The quality of reference materials provided in connection with course studies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost.
--+------

 
We believe that the range and depth of our course offerings, the quality of our trainers and reference materials are comparable or superior to those of our competitors. Typically, our trainers for our Elite courses have been active investors in their chosen field, have been trained by us and, to a large degree, are previous customers of our programs.

Brand Development Agreement with the T&B Seminars, Inc.
 
Effective December 23, 2019, we entered into a Real Estate Education Training Program Development Agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with T&B Seminars, Inc. (“T&B”), an affiliate of Tarek El Moussa, pursuant to which Holdings and Tarek El Moussa agreed to develop and operate a seminar style education business that will use, among other things, the names, images, and likenesses of Tarek El Moussa to market and sell customers real estate investing oriented education products. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, T&B granted to the Company a sole and exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property, including, certain trademarks and copyrights and the name, image and likeness of Tarek El Moussa, in each case to the extent necessary for Holdings to develop and create educational materials and promote and conduct a branded real estate seminar style education business that uses the intellectual property.
 
As consideration for the licensed rights under the Development Agreement, Holdings agreed to pay T&B base royalty percentages on cash sales of products to persons responding to a branded marketing campaign that uses the licensed intellectual property. Also, as consideration for Tarek El Moussa providing certain marketing support, Holdings agreed to pay T&B marketing royalty percentages on cash sales of products at live events and at online webinars to persons responding to a branded marketing campaign that uses the licensed intellectual property. Furthermore, as consideration for the exclusivity of the rights under the Development Agreement, commencing on the seventh month of the term of the Development Agreement, Holdings agreed that the monthly royalties paid to T&B will not be less than an agreed to amount.
 
The Development Agreement has an initial term of five years and will automatically renew thereafter for successive five-year terms unless either party provides prior written notice of termination no less than 90 days prior to the end of such five-year term.
 
The Company commenced sales activities under the Development Agreement under the Homemade Investor brand in January 2020 but as a result of the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended conducting live in-persons sales events in March 2020. Subsequently, we suspended online sales events during the third quarter of 2020 to focus on our new flagship brand Building Wealth with LegacyTM. 
 
Licensing Agreements with the Rich Dad and Other Parties
 
Through September 2019, our primary business relied on our license of the Rich Dad brand and related marks and intellectual property. The following transactions summarize our license to use the Rich Dad trademarks, trade names and other business information worldwide (the “Rich Dad Intellectual Property Rights”).
 
Effective September 1, 2013, we entered into licensing and related agreements with Rich Dad Operating Company, LLC (“RDOC”) (collectively, the “2013 License Agreement”) that replaced the 2010 License Agreement. Compared to the 2010 License Agreement, the 2013 License Agreement broadened the field of permitted use to include real estate investing, business strategies, stock market investment techniques, stock/paper assets, cash management, asset protection, entrepreneurship and other financially-oriented subjects. The 2013 License Agreement also (i) reduced the royalty rate payable to RDOC compared to the 2010 Rich Dad License Agreement; (ii) broadened the Company’s exclusivity rights to include education seminars delivered in any medium; (iii) eliminated the cash collateral requirements and related financial covenants contained in the 2010 License Agreement; (iv) continues our right to pay royalties via a promissory note that is convertible to preferred shares upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2013 License Agreement); (v) eliminated approximately $1.6 million in debt from our consolidated balance sheet as a result of debt forgiveness provided for in the agreement terminating the 2010 License Agreement; and (vi) converted another approximately $4.6 million in debt to 1,549,882 shares of our Common Stock. Either party may terminate the 2013 License Agreement upon certain circumstances, including and uncured breach by the non-terminating party.
 
On April 22, 2014, we entered into an agreement with RDOC (the “2014 Amendment”) to, among other things, amend the 2013 License Agreement to halve the royalty payable by us to RDOC to 2.5% for the whole of 2014, (ii) cancel approximately $1.3 million in debt owed by us to RDOC, (iii) reimburse us for certain legal expenses, and (iv) cancel RDOC’s right to appoint one member of our Board of Directors.
 
The 2013 License Agreement and the 2014 Amendment were assigned to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc. on September 10, 2014.
 
On January 25, 2018, we entered into a Second Amendment with RDOC (the “Second Amendment”) that amends certain terms of the 2013 License Agreement and extends the term of the 2013 License Agreement to September 1, 2019. (See the Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2018 for further discussion.)
 
On August 16, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the License Agreement that extended the term of the License Agreement through September 30, 2019.
 
On August 16, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the License Agreement that extended the term of the License Agreement through September 30, 2019. On September 16, 2019, we received notice from Rich Dad Operating Company, LLC (“RDOC”), indicating that RDOC did not intend to extend the term of the September 1, 2013, Rich Dad Operating License Agreement (as amended, the “License Agreement”) by and between the Company and RDOC. Therefore, the term of the License Agreement expired on September 30, 2019. Notwithstanding the expiration of the License Agreement, the Company may continue to use Licensed Intellectual Property, as defined in the License Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Rich Dad trademark and stylized logo, for the purpose of honoring and fulfilling orders by its customers in existence as of the date of the expiration of the Agreement.
 
Effective November 26, 2019, our licenses to operate under the Perform in Properties, Making Money with Martin RobertsTM and Robbie Fowler’s Property AcademyTM were transferred to Mayflower Alliance Ltd in conjunction with the sale of the business of Legacy UK.

Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 19 full-time employees, of whom 19, or 100 % were in our North America segment. In addition, we employ part-time employees in various capacities and independent contractors who are trainers, coaches or mentors. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Our independent contractors are either paid commissions based upon the dollar value of the courses purchased by customers at our free preview workshops and basic training courses or are paid fixed fees for teaching and mentoring Elite courses. Independent contractors are required to execute agreements with us that set forth their commission structures and typically contain confidentiality and non-competition provisions.
