Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
We are an international, vertically integrated commercial-stage company engaged in two principal aspects of the leisure gaming industry as (1) a business-to-consumer (“B2C”) licensed retail gaming operator (known as an “Operator”) offering our products through two sales distribution channels in (i) retail land-based or on-site physical venues and (ii) online through PC, tablet and mobile distribution, and (2) as a business-to-business (“B2B”) betting technology provider (known as a “Provider”) offering our proprietary betting technology either (1) directly to licensed operators or (2) through value-added re-sellers or systems integrators in the leisure betting industry.
 
As an Operator in the regulated Italian leisure betting market, we operate on a single-tier distribution strategy by collecting wagers on leisure betting products including a variety of lottery, casino gaming and sports bets through two channels: (i) online through websites on internet browsers and mobile solutions and also through relationships with affiliated physical venues known as “web-shops” (internet cafes; kiosks, coffee-shops, convenience stores, restaurants and bars, etc.) where patrons can open a game account, deposit funds and by using public Internet access to play online with their personal gaming account through common PC’s situated at each venue, and (ii) land-based through physical land-based retail venues (off-track betting shops, SSBT (“self-serve betting terminal”) kiosks, coffee-shops, convenience stores, restaurants, taverns and bars, etc.). We currently provide our gaming services through our subsidiaries, Multigioco Srl (“Multigioco”), and Ulisse GmbH (“Ulisse”). These operations are carried out via both land-based or online retail gaming licenses regulated by the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (“ADM”), and our Austrian Bookmaker license. In Italy our ADM license permit us to distribute leisure betting products such as sports betting, and virtual sports betting products through both physical, land-based retail locations as well as online through our licensed website newgioco.it or commercial webskins linked to our licensed website and through mobile devices, while our Austria Bookmaker license permits us to operate Data Transmission Centers (CTD), as described below, under the free-trade principles incorporated within bilateral Intra-EU trade agreements that refers to all trade, including e-commerce transactions in most goods, services and products between member states of the European Union (EU).
 
In Italy, our gaming products and services are offered to customers throughout the following four distribution channels:
 

· | Online gaming websites or mobile solutions where players, through an online account and an e-wallet, using the internet, can play online poker, online casinos games, sports betting wagers, play i-lottery games etc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Punti Virtuali di Ricarica (“PVR”) (translated as Virtual Reload Centers) or Web-shop (“web cafe” or “internet cafe”): A PVR or web-shop is a physical location that is operated by third-party independent businesses that promote our online gaming websites, acquires online customers and via manned or self-service automated terminals permit online-players to make cash deposits that are electronically credited to their personal online gaming accounts. While at the PVR online-players could also play games and wager through their personal online account by using the public internet accessing communal PC’s available at the venue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Agency or CTD: An agency or a CTD is an arcade location that is a gaming only venue that is operated by third-party independent businesses and that offers sport betting and virtual betting products and must have at least 70% of its square-footage dedicated specifically to gaming space. Each agency or CTD must have a cash cage for the primary purpose of gaming and gaming related transactions serving an indefinite number of anonymous walk-in customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Corner or Punto Sportivo (translated as Sporting Point-of-sale): A corner is distinguished from an agency insofar as the principal business situated at the location that is operated by third-party independent businesses and is an activity that is primarily different from gaming (such as a coffee shop or convenience store) with a terminal connected to the ADM network. The primary purpose of such facility is not gaming, but rather, there is only a small ‘corner’ for extra cash flow in exchange for a fee and/or commission. Specifically, a maximum of 30% of floor space of a corner location can be dedicated to gaming where gaming transactions are collected and processed by a counter clerk.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently service approximately 100,000 online user accounts and an indeterminate number of walk-in customers at a combination of the three types of venues: 1,000 web-shops, 7 corners and 113 agency/CTD locations.

As a global gaming technology Provider, we own and operate a betting software designed with a unique “distributed model” architecture colloquially named Elys Game Board (the “Platform”). The Platform is a fully integrated “omni-channel” framework that combines centralized technology for updating, servicing and operations with multi-channel functionality to accept all forms of customer payment through the distribution channels described above. The omni-channel software design is fully integrated with a built in player gaming account management and a built-in sports book. As a Provider, we employ a multi-tier distribution strategy on both a direct to customer channel and on a shared infrastructure basis.
 
The Platform is certified by the ADM, the Malta Gaming Authority (“MGA”) in Malta and Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) and is owned by our subsidiary Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung GmbH (“Odissea”). The software architecture was developed and built on the latest Microsoft.Net Core framework, supporting both online customer gaming accounts as well as land-based bet processing capability with multi-channel functionality accepting all forms of payment methods (i.e., cash, e-wallet, bank card and wire transfer, etc.) backed by a real-time customer relationship management (“CRM”) and business intelligence (“BI”) program for streamlined cross-platform marketing as well as a synchronized financial accounting processes. Data is communicated directly to on-the-ground sales and marketing agents that manage and maintain both our online and land-based retail distribution. The Platform allows our independent B2B customers to (i) rapidly and effectively model their gaming businesses and manage gaming accounts, (ii) monitor and analyze performance on an ongoing basis, (iii) share dashboards, and (iv) generate management reports all within a fully integrated solution. In addition, our clients can use the built-in business intelligence modules to evaluate actual performance and leverage insights from analytics to make informed, timely decisions to drive future business. The unique ’shop-client’ architecture of the Platform is to our knowledge a one-of-a-kind solution in the leisure betting industry. Elys was built around the specific needs of leisure betting operators and proven through our existing Multigioco distribution throughout Italy.
 
On January 30, 2019, we expanded our operations with our acquisition of Virtual Generation Limited (“VG” or “Virtual Generation”), which owns and has developed a virtual gaming software platform (“VGS”), and its holding company, Naos Holdings Limited (“Naos”). VG is a Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) certified virtual sports and gaming software developer with a portfolio of products, including greyhound and horse racing; league play football (i.e., soccer); keno; and American Roulette. In addition, VG’s platform allows for customization for country-specific sports generation including applications in Latin American and African markets. VG’s products are now distributed in several countries including Italy, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ecuador, Puerto Rico. Our prior non-operating holding company subsidiary Naos was discontinued with effect on December 31, 2019.
 
Organizational Structure
 
Our operations are carried out through three geographically organized groups: (i) an operational group which is based in Europe and maintains administrative offices headquartered in Rome, Italy with satellite offices for operations administration and risk management trading in Naples and Teramo, Italy and San Gwann, Malta; (ii) a technology group which is based in Innsbruck, Austria and manages software development, training and administration; and (iii) a corporate group which is based in North America and maintains an executive suite in San Francisco, California and a Canadian office in Toronto, Ontario through which we carry-out corporate activities, handle day-to-day reporting and U.S. development planning, and through which various employees, independent contractors and vendors are engaged.
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to expand our market presence by entering new foreign markets while at the same time further penetrating the Italian and additional European markets. We expect new markets to be a large source of our future growth, in particular, the United States market is one where we intend to offer the use of our Platform to existing commercial and tribal casinos, retail betting operators and franchise enterprises.
Our Strengths
 
We believe we have established ourselves as one of the leaders in the Italian leisure betting market. Below are our strengths that we believe should enable us to capture a meaningful share of the United States and global leisure betting market:

Highly Differentiated Technology Platform.
Built from the ground-up, the Platform is designed to be a highly flexible and robust sportsbook engine able to cope with the demands
of today’s betting operators and players. The Platform is an industry designed, user centric multi-channel solution and can
offer any type of sport (or non-sport) event and any type of betting market (i.e., soccer, football, basketball, hockey, baseball,
tennis, etc.) in both pre-match and in-game modes across both fixed-odds (player versus bookie) and pool (player versus player)
styles and manage the risk for each individual transaction through all verticals (i.e., online or land-based). Our proprietary
Platform is designed to address the independent operator’s ability to compete against larger and more established franchise
operators effectively and inexpensively. It is designed also to monitor, evaluate and permit the risk management of each bet transaction
at each location from which a bet is placed.


Market Momentum. We believe that our
unique multi-channel designed Platform is gaining momentum in the Italian leisure betting market also thanks to our comprehensive
retail shop-client application with integrated gaming account management functionalities and business intelligence modules. We
currently have approximately 100,000 online user accounts and an indeterminate number of walk-in customers through the four distribution
channels: mobile/desktop web sites, 1,000 web-cafés (or “web-shops”), 7 corners, and 113 agency/CTD locations.


Scalable Platform at Minimal Cost. Our
Platform is highly scalable. Expansion of the Platform under our existing infrastructure requires little additional overhead and
should create in-house efficiencies for our corporate operations and for our agents and operator clients. Many of the inherent
functions and features of our ADM Platform certification in Italy have received prior approval and adhere to multi-jurisdictional
standards which in our view will enable us to receive certification in new markets and expand into new markets in a timely manner.


Growing Industry. Online gambling is
growing in popularity. Gamblers worldwide increasingly prefer Internet and mobile channels for their betting activities due to
the ease of access offered and safety provided. Extensive usage of digital processes and growing bettor demand is driving the market
for online betting platforms. Recent liberalization and state-by-state legislation in the United States has resulted in new opportunities
in the United States sports betting market. We anticipate that the United States market will begin to have a strong and steady
uptake in active wagers. As of February 2021, twenty-one jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) have some form of legal
sports betting available. Five others, including the Washington and North Carolina, have authorized legal sports betting but not
yet launched their market.


Highly Experienced Senior Management
Team. We are led by a dedicated and highly experienced senior management team with significant industry experience and proven ability
to develop novel solutions. Each of the members of our senior management have more than 20 years of relevant experience.

Development of Foreign Markets
 

The North America Sports Betting Market.
In the U.S., until 2018 the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 combined with the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992
(“PASPA” or the “Bradley Act”), prohibited sports betting in the U.S. in all but four grandfathered states
(Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Delaware). In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned PASPA in a 6-3 decision that found the law
conflicted with the Tenth Amendment leaving individual states to decide whether to allow its residents to bet on sports. As described
below under the section “Developments in the U.S. Market”, many states, such as New Jersey, Montana, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania and others, have moved quickly to establish sports betting as a means to increase their respective capital resources.
While several states have recently passed legislation to allow online gambling, we believe that the U.S. sports betting market
will take 5 – 10 years to fully develop. We believe that the United States represents a large addressable market opportunity
for us with our Elys betting Platform. Additionally, in Canada we are observing promising legislative developments and we expect
a new digital gaming regulatory framework, combined with the permission of single-wagering sport betting events, to be in place
soon. This additional jurisdiction could represent a meaningful opportunity for our gaming solution.

Mergers and Acquisition in the Global
Gaming Industry. In an effort to scale and grow the business, we intend to evaluate potential acquisitions that can be easily integrated
into our business. Our acquisition of VG has allowed us to expand our product offerings in additional countries. The global gaming
industry is still very much fragmented. There has been a significant number of noteworthy consolidations such as: (1) The Stars
Group/SkyBet (July 2018) and CrownBet/William Hill Australia (April 2018); (2) Paddy Power/Betfair (February 2016) and with Stars
Group (April 2020); (3) GVC/BWIN Ladbrokes/Coral (March 2018), and (4) in gaming machine and lottery concentration (IGT/GTECH (April
2015); as well as others such as Pollard/Innova (July 2017); NYX Gaming Group/Scientific Games (January 2018) which we believe
provides us with an opportunity to capitalize on the acquisition of smaller operators forced to compete against newly formed larger
players. In addition to the above, and specifically in the US, we observed consolidations and acceleration of gaming operators
acquiring sports betting technology providers like (1) DraftKings acquiring SBTech (April 2020) (2) Caesars Entertainment acquiring
William Hill (September 2020) and (3) Bally’s Corporation acquiring Bet.Works (November 2020) which strengthens our position
as one of few remaining, truly independent sport betting provider in the market.

Further Penetration in the Italian Market
 

· | Acquisitions of Smaller Operators. Government legislated consolidation of the regulated Italian lottery and gaming market have driven smaller regional operators in Italy to our licensed brand “New Gioco”TM in both the online and land-based sales channels. The Italian regulated gaming market is the largest in the European Union (“EU”) and is extremely fragmented. Recent new regulations in Italy have made it more difficult for smaller regional operators throughout Italy to operate and we believe that our innovative and cost-effective Platform is an attractive alternative for such smaller regional operators throughout Italy that will not be able to maintain the new standards set out by the Italian regulator on their own.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Organic Growth. The Italian online gaming market continues to drive substantial growth in our core operations. From January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, we increased the number of registered online accounts to over 100,000 players and webshop locations we operate in Italy from approximately 1,000 to approximately 1,200 and believe that there is ample room for continued growth in the Italian market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expansion and New Markets
 
United States Operations Development
 
In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court (“SCOTUS”) ruled that the PASPA was unconstitutional as it violated the Tenth Amendment prohibition against forcing states to implement federal laws. Enacted in 1992, PASPA generally prohibited states from authorizing, licensing or sponsoring betting on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. PASPA did not make sports betting a federal crime; rather, it allowed the attorney general for the Department of Justice, as well as professional and amateur sports organizations, to bring civil actions to enjoin violations of the act. The SCOTUS decision opens the door for all states to legalize and regulate sports gambling within their borders. States such as Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Montana, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Michigan, Mississippi, Colorado and the District of Columbia have passed laws that were ready to be enacted once the federal ban on sports betting was lifted. In addition, additional states including Maine, California, Connecticut, Louisiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and Maryland are considering active bills.
 
We believe that the U.S. sports betting and online gaming market presents a large opportunity to deploy our Platform on a B2B2C basis to several potential independent commercial and tribal casino and gaming operators throughout the United States. In September 2020, our retail sports betting solution obtained Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) certification allowing our technology to be ready for deployment in the U.S. land-based gaming segment. Furthermore, we have analyzed the technical specifications checklist supplied by GLI to verify that coding in our online product meets the functional specifications set forth in the GLI-33 standards (The Gaming Laboratories International technical standard for event wagering systems). We believe that our online Platform currently meets the majority of the GLI-33 certification standards and we expect to be in a position to send our software to GLI for certification in 2021. Upon obtaining GLI-33 certification and obtaining regulatory approvals to operate in the digital segment, we also expect to be well-positioned to commence processing online sports bets in the U.S. on a B2B2C basis through our Platform.
 
10
 




As part of our multi-year business growth strategy, during 2019 and 2020 we made significant investments for expansion into new markets outside of Italy, including GLI-33 certification of our Platform, professional services, trade show marketing and brand promotion to enter and then build a foundation aimed at accelerating our U.S. expansion plans. To support these principal objectives, we initiated an ambitious investment strategy that is fundamental to the successful execution of our long-term business plan. These fundamental investments have resulted in short-term, non-recurring expenses related to key elements such as regulatory and policy requirements and establishing a centralized US-based headquarters.
 
In March 2019, we entered into a five-year agreement with Fleetwood Gaming, Inc. for the exclusive rights to distribute our Platform at select non-tribal locations such as sports bars and taverns in the state of Montana. The multi-year agreement is expected to allow Fleetwood to install our Platform throughout Fleetwood's distribution network in Montana. The agreement with Fleetwood Gaming is subject to the provision of open market regulation of sports betting in the State of Montana. No assurance can be given that this will occur.
 
In April 2019, we entered into a five-year agreement with the Chippewa Cree Tribe in Box Elder, Montana to install our Platform at the Northern Winz Casino. In this regard, in September 2019, we transacted the first legal Class 1 real-money bet in the U.S. on Indian Horse Relay Racing and on December 21, 2019 on traditional Indian Stick Game. Class 1 betting represents traditional indigenous sporting events or games that are not classed as mainstream sports bets. The agreement with the Chippewa Cree Tribe is subject to the provision of open market regulation of sports betting in the State of Montana. No assurance can be given that this will occur.
 
On May 28, 2020, we organized Elys Gameboard Technologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of expanding our sports betting operations throughout the US. We are in the process of seeking our first sports betting license in Washington, DC and anticipate launching our new US sports betting platform with our first US operator client in 2021.
 
On September 1, 2020, our Odissea subsidiary obtained ISO-27001:2013 certification for safety management. The process involved a detailed and formal compliance audit and independent testing of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) that now certifies Odissea to manage the security of sensitive third party information such as financial assets, legal and personal details.
 
In September 2020, we engaged Matteo Monteverdi, former senior executive of Sportradar and IGT as President of the Company to develop and lead in our go-to-market strategy in the U.S. And, on January 1, 2021 Mr. Monteverdi was appointed as Chief Executive Officer to establish and lead on the Company’s global growth initiatives.
 
In November 2020, we submitted an application with the DC Office of Lottery and Gaming to obtain a Managed Service Provider (MSP) license along with our partner Grand Central, LLC, a retail sports bar operator in Washington, DC, to provide sports betting products and services in their establishment upon the completion of their Class B licensing process.
 
The commencement of betting transactions in Montana and Washington, DC are subject to obtaining the required certification, licensing and approvals from the Gambling Control Division of the Montana Department of Justice and the District of Columbia Office of the Lottery and Charitable Games, respectively, which has not been determined as of the date of this Annual Report.
 
Products and Services and Distribution Methods
 
Betting Platform
 
We believe that our Platform, engineered and launched by our software development team at Odissea, is a highly efficient, cutting edge betting Platform technology that supports the processing of online client gaming account protocols as well as land-based betting protocols with seamless multi-channel functionality accepting all forms of payment methods (i.e., cash, e-wallet, bank card and wire transfer, etc.) and integrated with a real-time CRM and Business Intelligence program for streamlined cross-platform marketing as well as a synchronized financial accounting process.
 
Payment channels for both deposit and withdrawals online are as set forth below:
 

Player indirect – meaning that
the player makes a deposit indirectly to their gaming account through a licensed agent (such as a cash deposit to their gaming
account at a web-shop counter (e-credit to player account)).
 11
 




Player direct – meaning that the
player makes a deposit directly to their own gaming account through one or more of the following methods:

· | Credit Card;
--+-------------


· | ATM/Debit card;
--+----------------


· | Bank Wire;
--+-----------


· | Postal Money Order; and
--+------------------------


· | e-wallet or e-credit transfer.
--+-------------------------------

 
Payment channels for both play of wagers and settlement of winnings at the land-based or retail agency or corner counter is as follows:
 

Player direct – meaning that the
customer pays for the wager in cash and accepted debit or credit cards.

 
We currently employ a customizable client-focused and cost-effective “hands-on” method, rather than a “general approach” to our Platform design with the goal of empowering our player-facing agents and employees to enhance the players’ experience by allowing personalized dashboard design and customer care for all customer call-ins to our service agents. We believe that this strategy has been highly effective in the Italian retail betting market and has been instrumental in increasing our revenues, net earnings and player retention.
 
Gaming Product Offerings
 
Our online sales channel (websites and web-shops) offers a full suite of gaming products that can be played in both real-money or free-play modes which include:

Sports Betting: Considered the largest and most
well-known industry segment offering both pre-match and live in-game betting events on a wide variety of sports.
Online Casino: includes the following:


Traditional Online Slot Games: Automated (using
random number generated (“RNG”)) casino games and slot machines.
Traditional Online Table Games: Table games such
as roulette, blackjack and baccarat.


Poker: Texas Hold’em and Omaha in both cash
and tournament formats.
Bingo and Skilled and Interactive Games: Games that
are programmed with a random number generator to ensure constant fairness for all parties. These games include card games such
as tresette (3 Sevens), scopa (Sweep) and briscola (Trump).
Virtual Sports Betting: Various computer generated
sport and racing events that are programmed with a RNG.
Horse Racing: Live track horse racing events.

 
Our land-based locations generally offer only sports betting, virtual sports betting and horse racing.
 
Current Markets, Other Services and Facilities
 
In addition to complementing gaming offerings originally provided by our acquired operators with our Newgioco branding, we intend to add new products and services with the assistance of gaming specialists, software providers and market research professionals, such as we have done with our acquisition of VG. We believe that we can generate additional revenues by establishing more marketing centers and web-shops.
 
We currently service approximately 100,000 online user accounts and estimate that our online user base will continue to further increase based on projections of both organic growth and acquisitions of existing operators. In addition, we also service an indeterminate number of walk-in customers at our physical locations throughout Italy. And, subject to licensing requirements in each state, we also expect to begin to penetrate the U.S. market in 2021 with our first planned real-money location live in Washington, DC.
 
Our client’s range in age from ages 18 through 79 and are a mix of 70% male and 30% female. In addition, we separate our revenue source by (a) sports betting, (b) casino and card game betting and (c) poker. Our in-house analysis indicates that sports betting and casino games are more popular than poker and other card games among our customer base. Furthermore, sports betting is our most profitable revenue stream yielding the highest percentage of our gross gaming revenue at 51% of revenues, which is representative of industry metrics when measured by completed sports seasons on a year over year basis. Our second largest source of revenue is currently casino followed by poker. We anticipate a shift in revenue in the future and that our largest source of our future revenue growth will be from B2B2C, which is expected to have the highest gross margin followed by sportsbook, casino and poker.
 
12
 



Our internal analysis further indicates different gaming patterns among our male and female online users. Male players prefer sports-bets, while approximately 10% of them also explore casino and poker. Conversely, female players prefer casino and bingo while approximately 1% try our other games such as poker, sports-betting or lotteries.
 
Most of our users are currently located throughout Italy with the highest concentrations in larger centers such as Rome and Naples.
 
We expect that users from any operators that we acquire will continue to utilize our services and anticipate that any operators we acquire will have existing revenues from users who frequent their establishments and venues or use their gaming websites. In addition to acquiring customers through the acquisition of operators, we intend to obtain additional licenses and pursue contracts and relationships with other operators that we believe will attract and secure new users as we increase our customer base globally.
 
Revenue Streams


Our revenue streams primarily consist of transactional income and service revenue. We generate transactional revenue through collection of bets from sports wagering and gaming from online betting and land-based betting shops located throughout Italy through our current subsidiaries Multigioco acquired on August 15, 2014 and Ulisse acquired July 1, 2016, and we generate service revenue from providing our Platform services to third party operators on a B2B basis through our subsidiary, Odissea acquired July 1, 2016. We also generated transactional revenue through our prior subsidiary Rifa until it was amalgamated into Multigioco with effect on January 20, 2020. As we increase our customer base in Italy, our handle in our Italian operations reached approximately $454 million by the end of 2019 and $574 million by the end of 2020. In addition, our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 included revenue generated by VG acquired January 30, 2019, for 11 months of the year ended December 31, 2019, consisting of royalties invoiced for the sale of virtual games through authorized agents. We generated revenue of approximately $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, substantially all of which was generated from revenue from operations or services provided in Italy. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net gaming revenues represented 99.6% and 98.9% respectively of our revenue and Platform and service revenue represented 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively of revenue.
 
Gaming revenues
 
Revenues from sports-betting, casino, cash and skill games, slots, bingo and horse race wagers represent the gross pay-ins (also referred to as turnover) from customers less gaming taxes and payouts to customers. Revenues are recorded when the game is closed which is representative of the point in time at which we have satisfied its performance obligation. In addition, we receive commissions from the sale of scratch tickets and other lottery games. Commissions are recorded when the ticket for scratch off tickets and lottery tickets are sold.
 
Betting platform
 
Revenues from the Betting Platform include license fees, training, installation, and product support services. Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer has been made and our performance obligation has been fulfilled. License fees are calculated as a percentage of each licensee’s level of activity and are contingent upon the licensee’s usage. The license fees are recognized on an accrual basis as earned.
 
Mobile Browser Application
 
Based upon customer demand for improved performance, speed, and ease-of-use for sports betting on mobile devices, we engaged a dedicated internal team of engineers to this distribution channel and have already launched and intend to continue to launch several new and innovative features.
 
Our next-generation mobile browser and application based betting solution on our Elys Platform is constantly evolving and being customized for deployment in each specific country market. The mobile solution is dedicated to improving the user experience with respect to sports betting with a unique modular design that allows quick go-to-market with plug-and-play features, we have the ability to tailor the mobile app to each market, including specific look and feel features, while end users quickly get to the desired bet ticket with just a few clicks. The modular architecture design of our mobile platform includes features inherent in the leading-edge Material Design framework developed by GoogleTM in 2014. Material Design is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation of technology and science allowing the flexibility to quickly create new layouts for a variety of both enterprise brands and chain store locations, private brands and applications to add other features such as loyalty rewards for restaurants and cruise lines, push marketing for customer acquisition and retention and importantly, the ability to offer both online and land-based betting distribution under a variety of gaming regulations.

Our Websites
 
We own our branded url (uniform resource locator) newgioco.it that we operate in accordance with the ADM GAD licensing requirements either directly or through white label websites with online customers, or alternatively, contract the websites to third party agents or promoters operating webskin urls under the newgioco.it licensed website. Our licensed gaming website, newgioco.it, currently processes live and virtual sports bets and mobile sports betting transactions through our Platform, while online casino and poker are provided under a third-party service provider agreement with Microgame SpA, and lotto products are provided by Lottomatica SpA.
 
We also own our branded url newaleabet.net that we operate under our Austrian Bookmaker license where we currently process live and virtual sports bets and mobile sports betting transactions through our Platform.
 
Both gaming websites are tailored for the Italian market and Odissea provides and operates all aspects of our online gaming websites including servers, routers, software development, sportsbook trading, telephone betting, licensing, website hosting, payment solutions, security, and gaming related customer support needs.
 
The branded website newgioco.it serves both players directly and web-shops (i.e., internet café’s) through the online channel of our Platform. There are some variations in website style because we offer different services through distinctive marketing campaigns:
 

newgioco.it is mainly devoted to marketing for shops,
including marketing with respect to campaigns, branding, and proposals/marketing for prospective operators to become a “Newgioco
shop” and is the landing page for all white-label websites. A landing page refers to a webpage that is generally owned by
a promoter (which can also be referred to as a betting shop) which redirects their marketing (social network, friends or other
forms of marketing) to this main webpage. Apart from a few advertisements, the landing page links patrons to sign-up or register
directly on the newgioco.it main page except that a promotional code is tied to the link, such that the web promoter can funnel
its marketing through a subnet. In the case of Italy, the entire subnet (a subnet is a logical grouping of connected network devices;
nodes on a subnet tend to be located in close physical proximity to each other such as on a LAN) must be connected to the ADM network
(and all games offered through the network) must be certified and approved by SOGEI (an entity authorized to conduct such certification
and approval by the Italian Ministry of Finance).

 
Our newgioco.it website offers wagering in many categories of sports events. We intend to capture a larger share of the Italian sports betting market by focusing on the Serie A, Serie B, and Serie C soccer matches as well as virtual sports betting, online poker, online casino and slots, skill games, and Italian horse racing through agent-based sales campaigns.
 
Our direct sales campaigns aimed at end users and agent based sales campaigns are offered through white-label pages or webskins that direct gaming transactions through our licensed website newgioco.it. We currently operate eleven such webskins as follows:
 

● originalbet.it | ● timetobet.it

webskins or white-label pages are dedicated
to the end-user, or player, and focus on regional campaigns and gaming offerings directed at local players, such as welcome bonuses,
poker rake rebate for poker players, etc. A white-label page is a complete gaming website (similar to the main website of the licenser
(in our case Multigioco)) but with the interface and logo of the promoter. The promoter earns fees based on a percentage of the
handle (turnover) generated through their website.

 
In relation to the third-party websites, the promoter (“partner”, “shop”, “agent” or “promoter”) is responsible for marketing strategies, administration and costs. The promoter may utilize special promotions, draws and incentives to drive players to their website to increase gaming handle (turnover) or visits. Generally, these regional promoters operate in areas that are remote or distant from our central operations based in Rome. Therefore, some promotions may be tied to local events in the jurisdictions surrounding the “home base” of the promoter rather than originating from our main operations. The relationship with local shops and players from the promoter region remains with the promoter since there may be regional nuances that attract their clientele to our gaming offerings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the gaming business is owned by the underlying licensor (i.e., Multigioco) and is included in our overall financial results as gaming handle (turnover).

The promoter does not have direct access to our client gaming accounts and is therefore not legally responsible or liable for maintaining gaming account balances. Instead, the licensor is legally responsible for compliance and client gaming account control such as anti-money laundering, know-your-client and minimum age restrictions, and is also required to ensure that all payouts due to players are credited to each players’ gaming account and are available to players within seven business days of the completion of the play.
 
In the Italian market, our websites are only published in Italian. We may include additional languages if we determine that such services are commercially viable and if we agree to pay the related development fees. We currently have plans to expand our websites to include additional languages in the future.
 
Although we have a diverse portfolio of product and service offerings through our websites, we intend to focus on creating in-house cost savings and synergies by undertaking strategic acquisitions of competing webskin operators and to operate them under our Newgioco branding. We intend to replicate our successful operational model developed in the regulated Italian market through the U.S. and into other international markets.
 
Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form any part of, this Form 10-K. We have included our website address as a factual reference and do not intend it to be an active link to our website. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through the investor relations page of our internet website as soon as reasonably practicable.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any patents or have any patent applications pending in Italy or any other jurisdiction. As a result of our acquisitions of Multigioco, Rifa and the gaming assets of Newgioco Srl, we obtained the rights to the domestic distribution brand known throughout Italy as New Gioco, and in July 2015, we obtained a trademark on the brand and logo for New Gioco. Our prior subsidiary Rifa was amalgamated into Multigioco with effect on January 20, 2020.
 
As a result of the acquisition of Odissea, we obtained the intellectual property and technical know-how behind our Elys betting Platform.
 
We also have proprietary rights to a number of trademarks, service marks and trade names used in this Annual Report which are important to our business including “NewAleabet”, “OriginalBet”, “LovingBet” and “Elys.”
 
Research and Development
 
We are continually updating the Platform and the products that we offer. We incurred expenses in the amount of approximately $1.7 million and $0.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively for research and development. We expect that expenses we incur for development and improving our betting software to be continuous recurring research and development expenses.
Industry Overview 
 
See the section entitled COVID-19 Update found elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry.


Overview of the Italian Leisure Betting Industry
 
Leisure betting describes consumer entertainment products such as purchase of lottery tickets, scratch off tickets, sports betting and online casino, which customers play on a daily or regular basis.
 
Gambling has been culturally rooted since Roman times, and as such, Italian gaming laws are governed by a well-defined set of regulations which are considered to be some of the most advanced and robust regulations in the world. The ADM has created a barrier to entry into the gaming industry in Italy through its implementation of processes and regulations aimed at consolidating and reducing the number of licenses including, but not limited to, increased insurance requirements, increased minimum number of locations.

Overview of the Global Leisure Gaming Market
 
The easing of government regulations on sports betting is expected to be a primary growth driver for the global online gambling market. We believe that the tax revenue in addition to increase in employment opportunities derived from online gambling will motivate governments around the globe to legalize online gambling. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the national ban on sports betting (PASPA) was unconstitutional, paving the way for states to enact laws authorizing sports gambling.
 
The future of sports betting in the United States looks very promising in 2021. Despite the sudden COVID-related suspensions of nearly all sports from March to early summer of 2020, the first two years since the repeal of PASPA still saw growth for legal sports betting, both in terms of market expansion in legal states and new legislation paving the pathway to regulated sports betting in additional jurisdictions.
 
As of February 2021, twenty-one jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) have some form of legal sports betting available. Five others, including the Washington and North Carolina, have authorized legal sports betting but not yet opened their market. Larger markets such as California, Texas, and Ohio remain uncertain at this time.
 
The global online gambling market is gaining popularity in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) because online sports betting sites generate substantial revenues for governments. Their significant contribution to national revenues is encouraging several countries to legalize online gambling.
 
The global online gambling market is characterized by the presence of several vendors competing to gain market dominance. Some small vendors are operating only in specific product verticals such as casino and lottery, while other vendors are operating in multiple areas including poker and sports betting. The growth opportunity for these vendors is increasing due to the rise in the number of online gambling providers and improved access to the internet around the world, as well as the increase in the number of players.
 
Certain key vendors in the global online gambling market are:
 

● Bet 365 (Hillside Group); | ● bet-at-home.com; 
------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
● The Stars Group (formerly Poker Stars); | ● GVC Holdings; 
● Paddy Power Betfair: (now merged with Stars Group); | ● Ladbrokes Coral Group: (now merged with GVC Holdings); 
● DraftKings; | ● GAN Limited 
● 888 Holdings; | ● IGT/GTECH Lottomatica SpA, and 
● William Hill; | ● Kindred (Unibet Group). 



Other notable product vendors in the market also include Betsson, Gamenet/Intralot/Goldbet, Camelot Group, Genting UK, NetEnt, Playtech (acquired Snaitech), and Rank Group. See “Competition” below for additional information on major operators in Italy.
 
The sports betting segment is expected to grow with the increased popularity of global soccer sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup and ongoing global growth of cricket and rugby tournaments. In addition, online betting is popular in many sports events that take place around the globe including basketball, horse and greyhound racing, ice hockey, baseball, golf, tennis and American football. Sports betting is becoming more popular due to the expansion of wagering on these sports through online channels.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the leisure gaming industry is moderate with operators competing for customers in various geographic markets. These include online operations of “land- based” casino operators, poker rooms, sports/race books, bingo, skills games, lottery, betting exchanges as well as internet or web only based operators. The global reach of the internet together with the abundant supply of games and operators means that users can easily switch gaming platforms and operators, thereby increasing competition. Government and other regulations make it more difficult for operators to expand their footprint in certain markets leading to the consolidation of operators in such markets, while the easing of regulations in some markets has permitted more operators to expand to new marketplaces.
 
We compete with several private and publicly listed companies that provide land-based and/or online gaming, many of which have greater sources of financing, greater name recognition and have been engaged in the industry longer than we have. In addition, current land-based casino competitors, many of which have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources than us, may provide Internet gaming services in the future.

shops and employs over 16,000 people worldwide.

Government Regulations
 
We conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, of which Italy has historically contributed the most significant recurring gaming revenue, while our VG subsidiary operates as a vendor or supplier to the gaming industry in such other jurisdictions. We are subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in as set forth below. Current and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of regulated online and land-based gaming and wagering. Any noncompliance with the various laws and regulations that our operations are subject to may harm our business and results of operations.
Italy
 
Italian operation of land-based and online gaming activities requires a license awarded by the ADM. The ADM is responsible for, among other things:
 

regulating games and enforcing relevant
regulatory provisions;
issuing licenses, and supervising compliance
by licensees;
monitoring the distribution of gaming
services; and
collecting gaming taxes.

 
There are currently two main categories of licenses (land-based and online) issued or awarded by the ADM in three series:
 

Series 1 first issued by legal decree
in 1992, renewed in 2009 under the Abruzzo decree and are colloquially branded as “Monti” licenses, that expired in
2016 and are expected to be called for renewal tender between 2021 and 2023;
Finance Act series which were awarded
by tender in 2006 and are known as “Bersani” Licenses that expired in 2016 and are expected to be called for renewal
tender between 2021 and 2023; and
New series Gioco a Distanza (Games at
a Distance) (“GAD”) issued by application process under the Comunitaria decree in 2010 expire in 2021 and are expected
to be renewed through a license tender auction.

 17
 



The Monti and Bersani licenses provide distribution authorization to operate both Negozio Sportivo (agency) and Punto Sportivo (corner) land-based establishments as well as GAD online (web-based) distribution. Land-based Monti licenses and Bersani licenses are subject to and expected to be consolidated under a new decree at renewal auction which is expected to be called for renewal tender between 2021 and 2023, to match up with the limited number of Comunitaria Series GAD licenses expiring in 2021.
 
We currently hold, through our subsidiaries four gaming licenses upon which our business is dependent: (i) a Bersani license, (ii) a Monti license, (iii) a GAD license and (iv) an Austrian bookmaker license. Our Italian Bersani, Monti and GAD licenses are issued by the ADM, while our Austrian bookmaker license is issued by the Austrian Gambling Authority (BMF). Each Italian license is typically valid for a term of nine years while the Austrian license has a lifetime duration and, in both cases, can be terminated if we fail to comply with required regulations in each country. The renewal process for the Bersani license and Monti license, is a call to tender auction process held at the same time for all licensees approximately once every nine years with the highest bidders being awarded not only licenses but rights to operate a certain number of land-based locations. In addition, the maximum number of land-based license rights that any one operator may bid on at auction is 20% of the total market being auctioned.
 
Each of the Bersani and Monti land-based licenses allow us to offer specific gaming products through physical retail locations that require one license right per each physical location. The rights granted under the Bersani and Monti licenses are not fixed to any specific physical location and can be moved at the discretion of the licensee to any physical address so long as the physical address has a police issued municipal license (as prescribed by article 86, paragraph 3, of the Italian Unified Text of Public Security Law (TULPS)) to sell gaming products and so long as the physical locations meet the ADM requirements, most of which are zoning requirements that require that the location is situated at a minimum distance from schools, churches and ATM’s and banks. Multigioco currently holds one land-based Bersani license with seven corner location rights that was issued to it in 2006, and one land-based Monti license with three agency location rights that was issued to it in 2010. Each of the Monti and Bersani licenses held by Multigioco expired in 2016. Although both of these land-based “concession” series of licenses expired for all Italian licensed operators in 2016, the ADM has granted a letter of authority which permits us to continue our land-based operations in Italy until the government holds the next organized auction for the renewal of licenses, which is expected to take place between 2021 and 2023.
 
By extending the pre-2016 concession licenses, the ADM has instituted an environment that authorizes licensed Operators to continue operating until the next license renewal auction. In this regard, certain non-Italian, European-based operators have commenced civil proceedings in the European Court of Justice against the ADM’s efforts to prohibit access to the regulated Italian betting market by foreign operators. The outcome of these proceedings and the effect on our business in the Italian market are presently unknown.
 
For a description of the risks associated with the licenses and their renewal see the Risk Factors. Our failure to successfully acquire the requisite number of location rights we desire at the renewal auction in Italy may adversely impact our business. In such event, we will most likely either acquire rights in the secondary market from someone selling rights they acquired at auction at prices which are typically higher than the auction prices of the ADM or open additional web-shops, which will be less expensive but also have lower profit margins than the land-based operations.
 
Multigioco was awarded a Comunitaria Series GAD license by the ADM in 2011. The licenses provide Multigioco the right to:
 

offer gaming products that ADM authorizes
for deployment in Italy through online channels which include websites and apps displayed on a PC, tablet or mobile phone;
enter into licensing, joint venture and
acquisition agreements with shops and private enterprises as concessionaires that provide various local services such as convenience
stores, bars, cafes, and restaurants in Italy;
establish web cafe`s as permitted by
the regulations enforced by the ADM regional office within Italy; and
take such steps such as know your client
(“KYC”) and anti-money laundering controls (“AML”) that are deemed necessary to develop the business of
regulated gaming in Italy.

An online account allows a player to fund an account through a variety of electronic payment channels such as credit cards, ATM/debit cards and bank wires. The GAD license allows us the opportunity to open an unlimited number of web-shops and to close any of the web-shops that we open in our sole discretion. We currently operate approximately 1,000 web-shops throughout Italy. Our GAD license expires on June 15, 2021 and can be renewed provided that we have not violated any regulations. Although we believe that we will be able to renew this license through a tender notice process, no assurances can be given that the renewal will be timely, if at all.
 
Ulisse holds one Austrian bookmaker license that it was issued in June 2018 which has no termination date but may be terminated or cancelled by the regulator if Ulisse fails to comply with any regulations. In accordance with established inter-European business principles that permit the formation and operation of business within EU state members, we currently operate gaming websites and 110 CTD retail locations in Italy under our Austrian bookmaker license. All 110 CTD retails locations were closed for the greater part of 2020 due to the COVID-19 restrictions, and it is currently unknown if or when any of the locations will re-open as CTD locations. We made a strategic business decision to transfer the Ulisse customer relationships to Multigioco during the 2021 year, operating under the Multigioco licenses and platform, focusing our Ulisse operations on the Austrian and other European markets.
 
In addition, our software Platform has been certified for use in Italy in accordance with the ADM requirements by Quinel M. Limited, an international technology auditor that conducted an audit of the Platform in June 2017. The purpose of the certification is to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of communications between the supplier interface and the user/operator interface. Any updates to the software or changes to key functions that we implement, require recertification, for which there can be no assurance that our software will qualify.
 
As a result of ongoing proceedings in the European Court of Justice regarding the application of Italian regulation for wagering under the Intra-EU model since the past renewal date of June 30, 2016 the ADM has imposed a moratorium on the issuance of new sports betting licenses and standardization of regulations. In the interim, the ADM is delaying the Italian license renewal process and has temporarily instituted operating authorizations for pre-2016 concessions that allow operators, including Multigioco, to continue to operate until the next license renewal is announced and concluded. The outcome and duration of this process is presently unknown.
 
United States
 
There is no federal United States legislation that explicitly addresses the legality of online gambling. However, there are several acts that impact online gambling.
 
The Federal Wire Act of 1961 makes the placing of sports bets over the telephone illegal. The Federal Wire Act of 1961 does not explicitly refer to online gambling, leaving its applicability to on online gambling open to interpretation.
 
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIGEA”) prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the Internet. While the UIGEA does not define online gambling as being illegal, the UIGEA instructs the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to impose obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming-related financial transactions. It also expressly requires Internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received (i.e., within state borders). As a result of the UIGEA we may not accept bets received by use of wire communications facilities, including telephones and computers, unless such bets originated and terminated in jurisdictions where such betting or wagering is legal.
 
In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (the “PASPA”) was unconstitutional as it violated the Tenth Amendment prohibition against forcing states to implement federal laws. Enacted in 1992, PASPA generally prohibited states from authorizing, licensing or sponsoring betting on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. PASPA did not make sports betting a federal crime; but rather, it allowed the attorney general for the Department of Justice, as well as professional and amateur sports organizations, to bring civil actions to enjoin violations of PASPA. The U.S. Supreme Court decision opens the door for all states to legalize and regulate sports gambling within their borders. States such as Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Montana, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Michigan, Mississippi, Colorado and the District of Columbia have passed laws that were ready to be enacted once the federal ban on sports betting was lifted. In addition, additional states including Maine, California, Connecticut, Louisiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and Maryland are considering active bills.
 
United Kingdom and European Union
 
The United Kingdom and certain European Union countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Greece have enacted online gaming laws and regulations. To the extent that we operate in any of these jurisdictions, our operations will need to be in compliance with the laws and regulations of such jurisdiction.
 
19
 



Additional Government Regulations
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws which cover among others, taxation, virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing.
Human Capital Resources
 
As a multinational company our business success is dependent upon our global workforce which spans six countries. As of December 31, 2020, we employed one person directly located in Canada, and two people in the United States and engaged three persons as independent contractors, while our subsidiaries Multigioco employed 38 full-time employees located in Italy, and approximately 12 independent contractors and sales agents, Odissea employed 7 full-time employees located in Austria and 20 contractors, Ulisse employed 10 full-time employees and Virtual Generation employed 11 full time employees between Italy, Malta and its international offices. Approximately 40% of our employees are part of our technology team and 60% are involved in finance, general management and other administrative functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Our recruitment programs are regionally focused, and hiring is done at a local level to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
 
We also offer our employees a compensation packages with premier health and welfare programs for employees and family members. In addition, every employee is eligible for equity awards to share in the Company’s financial success. Our unlimited paid time off programs enable our workforce to enjoy personal time away from their job responsibilities.
 
In early March 2020, we implemented a safe work plan to protect the health of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing our administrative offices. We have encouraged most of our employees to work from home, and in the meantime, we have implemented health and safety protocols in our administrative offices to ensure that we are ready for the safe return of our employees to our offices when the time comes. In order to ensure the success of our employees during the shift to remote work, we developed training resources for managers to ensure they had the proper skills to lead remote teams and provided training to employees on how to be effective while working remotely.
 
COVID-19 Update
 
As result of the global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, on March 8, 2020 the Italian government issued a decree which imposed certain restrictions on public gatherings and travel, and closures of physical venues that included betting shops, arcades and bingo halls across Italy, which measures continue in effect as of the date of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, we had temporarily closed approximately 150 betting shop locations throughout Italy as a result of the decree until May 4, 2020.
 
On March 10, 2020 the Italian government imposed further restrictions on travel throughout Italy as well as transborder crossings and have either postponed or cancelled most professional sports events which has had an effect on our overall sports betting handle and revenues and may negatively impact our operating results.
 
On June 19, 2020 all land-based betting shops, including corner locations such as coffee shops throughout Italy temporarily reopened until November 2020 when the Italian government imposed new lockdowns that currently remain in place. The closing of physical betting shop locations did not affect our online and mobile business operations which has mitigated some of the impact. To date, due to the global resurgence of COVID-19 cases, all betting shops remain closed for business, however the Italian Government is closely monitoring the pandemic and has indicated that although it is important to keep the economy operating, it will not remove the restrictions on social gatherings, which may affect the potential reopening of some of our land-based locations.
