As a global customer experience and commerce agency and process outsourcer, we offer scalable and cost-effective solutions for brand manufacturers, online retailers, and distributors across a wide range of industry segments to serve business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) channels. We provide our clients with seamless and transparent solutions to support their business strategies, allowing them to focus on their core competencies. Leveraging our technology, expertise, and proven methodologies, we enable clients to develop and deploy new products and implement new business strategies or address new distribution channels rapidly and efficiently through our optimized solutions. Our clients engage us, both as a consulting partner to assist them in the design of a business solution, as well as a virtual and physical infrastructure partner to provide the mission-critical operations required to build and manage their business solution. Together, we not only help our clients define new ways of doing business, but also provide them the technology, physical infrastructure, and professional resources necessary to quickly implement their commerce objectives. We allow our clients to quickly and dramatically change how they “go-to-market” and service their customers.
Each client has a unique business model and unique strategic objectives that often require highly customized enterprise solutions. We support clients in a wide array of industries, including health; fragrance and beauty products; cosmetics; fashion apparel and accessories; luxury goods; consumer packaged goods (“CPG”); coins and collectibles; jewelry; home furnishings and housewares; consumer electronics; quick-serve restaurants ("QSR"); telecommunications; technology manufacturing; computer and office products; among others. Clients turn to LiveArea Professional Services and PFS Operations for help in addressing a variety of business needs that include strategic consulting, commerce experience design and development, product innovation, customer satisfaction and retention, time-definite logistics, vendor managed inventory and integration, supply chain compression, cost model realignments, transportation management, and international expansion, among others. We also act as a constructive agent of change, providing clients the ability to alter their current distribution model, establish direct relationships with end-customers, reduce the overall time and costs associated with existing distribution channel strategies, while improving customer experience via value-added distribution solutions such as gift-wrapping and product personalization. Our clients are seeking B2C and B2B and B2B2C solutions that will provide them with dynamic supply chain and multi-channel marketing efficiencies, while ultimately delivering a world-class, branded customer service experience.
Our value proposition is to serve as a seamless, well-integrated extension of our clients’ enterprises by delivering superior solutions that drive optimal customer experiences. On behalf of the brands we serve, we strive to increase and enhance sales and market growth, bolster customer satisfaction and customer retention and drive costs out of the business through operations and technology related efficiencies. As both a virtual and a physical infrastructure for our clients’ businesses, we embrace their brand values, strategic objectives and operational processes. By utilizing our services, our clients are able to: 
Quickly Capitalize on Market Opportunities. We offer a collection of solutions focused on helping clients quickly assess opportunities that respond to the changing world of technology and assisting clients in harnessing innovation and brand experience through lean start-up methodologies. Our solutions empower clients to rapidly implement their supply chain and commerce strategies and take advantage of opportunities by utilizing our readily available advanced technology and physical infrastructure which facilitates a quick integration and implementation. The solution is designed to allow our clients to deliver consistent, quality service as transaction volumes grow and handle daily and seasonal peak periods. Our international locations allow our clients to expand the global reach of their products. 
Elevate the Customer Experience. We enable our clients to provide their customers with a high-touch, positive buying experience, thereby maintaining and promoting brand loyalty. We create omni-channel commerce experiences designed to fit into and fuel a connected digital ecosystem. Our e-commerce solutions communicate seamlessly with stores and varying client applications. Through our use of advanced technology, we help our clients respond directly to customer inquiries by email, voice or data communication and assist them with online ordering and product information. We offer our clients a “world-class” level of service, including high-touch customer care service centers, detailed Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) reporting, and exceptional order accuracy. We have significant experience in the development of e-commerce storefronts that allows us to recommend features and functions easily navigated and understood by our clients’ customers through guided selling designs. Our technology platform is designed to ensure high levels of reliability and fast response times for our clients’ customers. Because of our technology, our clients benefit from being able to offer the latest in traditional customer communication and auto-response technology to their customers. Using data, we create customer relationship-building insights that drive both strategy and action. Our fulfillment facilities are designed for efficient multi-brand operation with an emphasis on creating branded fulfillment experiences featuring custom

packaging, gift-wrapping, extensive personalization options and build-to-order and build-to-stock kitting. Our solutions provide enhanced brand recognition with streamlined and ease of use shopping, checkout, shipping, unboxing and return of goods processing. 
Minimize Investment and Improve Operating Efficiencies. One of the most significant benefits outsourcing provides is the ability to transform fixed costs into variable costs. By eliminating the need to invest in a fixed capital infrastructure, our clients’ costs typically become more directly correlated with volume increases or declines. Further, as volume increases drive the demand for greater infrastructure or capacity, we are able to quickly deploy additional resources. We provide services to multiple clients, which enables us to offer our clients economies of scale and resulting cost efficiencies that they may not have been able to obtain on their own. Additionally, because of the large number of daily transactions we process, we have been able to justify investments in levels of automation, security surveillance, quality control processes, and transportation carrier interfaces that are typically outside the scale of investment that our clients might be able to cost-justify on their own. We engage our Service Design capabilities to help brands evolve and improve how they service their clients with a digital advantage through our services. These additional capabilities can provide our clients the benefits of enhanced operating performance and efficiency and expanded customer service options. 
Access a Sophisticated Technology Ecosystem. We provide our clients with access to a technology ecosystem featuring best-of-breed e-commerce technologies together in a single, integrated, Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) certified order to cash offering. Powered by leading enterprise-class software solutions, our order to cash platform is seamlessly integrated into a variety of e-commerce platforms and supporting technology components and services to provide an end-to-end e-commerce solution. Built to accelerate the implementation process, the technology ecosystem allows for flexible integrations with other technology providers and client systems. 
Our Technology Ecosystem also extends beyond the digital world and into physical commerce channels. Brands and retailers today require flexible technology to control customer shopping experiences regardless of where they shop. As a global commerce services company, we offer unbiased evaluation of new platforms and emerging technologies to help brands choose the best option for their businesses. Deploying ship from store, in-store pick-up, pop-up distribution centers, or mobile point of sale capabilities are just a few examples of how we can enable brands to create a dynamic and unique omni-channel shopping experience. 
Our highest value proposition is achieved when our clients engage our full end-to-end suite of services from both LiveArea Professional Services and PFS Operations. However, we provide our clients with the freedom to customize their solution by selecting only certain services from our offering in an à la carte fashion. We believe this flexibility and willingness to create a customized solution for each client differentiates us from our competition. We also believe that bringing our deep understanding of end-to-end engagements to clients who are only using a portion of our offering is a key differentiator and brings significant value to our solutions and our clients.

Service Design
Service Design is a business transformation service helping clients create efficiency and identify new revenue streams through the analysis and re-imagining of their services, customer touchpoints, technology, and business processes. We help clients look at their business not as a series of divisions and products, but as a cohesive collection of services they offer customers. We offer a more holistic way to evaluate and solve problems at the customer experience level. 
Product Innovation
Our Product Innovation service helps clients rapidly invent, prototype, and test innovative new ideas for products and businesses. Through a series of workshops, we team with clients to invent, identify, generate, and develop customer value proposition opportunities for their business. We examine where customer value overlaps with potential business value to arrive at a shared value proposition that underpins the experience and design of the client’s initial product. 
Connected Commerce 
Through our Connected Commerce service, we help clients transform their business and customer relationships by creating seamless commerce experiences online and in-store and other environments, such as pop ups. The service is inclusive of e-commerce strategy, consulting services, and technology services. Our approach features four hybrid-agile phases: Rapid start; Design and Build; Test and Launch; and Optimize. The e-commerce solutions adhere to a proven methodology to deliver quality implementations to meet client branded requirements in the industry based on our clients’ custom solutions. 
As a platform-agnostic provider, we have dedicated commerce technology practices specializing in all of the leading enterprise platforms. We employ a highly qualified team of solutions architects, web developers, project managers, and quality assurance (“QA”) specialists. 
Performance Marketing
Traditional marketing is difficult to track and measure, so marketers have difficulties understanding their return on investment. LiveArea Performance Marketing includes a comprehensive set of marketing services that allows brands to ensure they are truly paying for results. Our tools and approach allow us to tie each dollar spent on customer experience and marketing to its effect on the customer’s journey. This allows us to optimize the journey – from first exposure to client brands, through first purchase, loyalty, and beyond. 
We offer a comprehensive set of Performance Marketing services, including: Search Engine Optimization (SEO), where we help clients increase the quality and quantity of organic website traffic and increase brand exposure through non-paid search engine results; Data Analytics where through data capture and strategic analysis, we enable our clients to act on customer insights mined for maximum return; Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) where we focus on improving client conversion rates; Digital Marketing where we enhance marketing performance, creating a cohesive approach to marketing across web, social and other channels; Paid Media where we build holistic programs that include paid search, social, display, and native and affiliate marketing channels to put our clients where their target consumers shop and buy; and with Email Marketing where we help clients create custom, relevant journeys and messaging that help brands nurture and retain customers. 
Orchestrated Services
LiveArea assists clients in outsourcing the responsibility of maintaining their core technology systems to improve operations, make smarter, safer decisions, and reduce expenses. LiveArea Orchestrated Services helps clients evaluate the right digital transformation strategies, mitigate workloads, manage infrastructure and backup, and secure data and applications. Our orchestrated services team provides real-time management and monitoring to ensure our clients’ sites operate at peak performance and provides solutions support for optimal issue management. Our automation tools facilitate fast, accurate code deployment - whether applying a software patch or launching a new feature. 
PFS Operations
Through the PFS Operations business segment, we provide the operational activities required and expected of the world's leading brands. Our solutions support B2C, B2B, and retail sales channels. We have DTC and B2B experience in customizing solutions to meet the unique nuances of our clients’ internal finance, customer care, supply chain, and omni-channel operations. With approximately 1.6 million square feet of leased distribution space and approximately 1,100+ contact center seats across two continents, we have the global infrastructure to meet the operational needs of our e-commerce and traditional B2B clients.
Table of Contents

We focus on three core actions: to deliver, to communicate, and to fulfill the promise behind each brand we support.
The majority of our clients are the merchants of record for the orders we process through our infrastructure on their behalf. For these clients, we do not own the inventory or the resulting accounts receivable but provide commerce solutions and other services for these client-owned assets.
For some of our clients, we are the merchant of record for the orders we process through our infrastructure. Depending on the terms under these arrangements, we record either product revenue or service fee revenue, may own the accounts receivable and inventory and we may be compensated for all or a portion of our services through the resulting profit margin. In some of these client relationships, we purchase the inventory as the product is delivered to our facility. In other of these client relationships, the client retains ownership of inventory in our facility and we purchase the inventory immediately prior to each individual customer sales transaction. In all of these cases, we seek inventory financing from our clients in the form of extended terms, working capital programs or marketing funds to help offset the working capital requirements that follow accounts receivable and inventory ownership.
Order to Cash (Order Management as a Service)
Our order to cash service provides our clients with distributed order orchestration and payment processing.  Our order to cash service features an Oracle-based, custom, scalable Distributed Order Management (“DOM”) technology platform built for B2C and B2B and order processing with a variety of fully-integrated B2C and B2B payment processing and fraud management platforms and technologies. Our order to cash service provides interfaces that allow for real-time information retrieval, including information on inventory, sales orders, shipments, delivery, purchase orders, warehouse receipts, customer history, accounts receivable and credit lines. These solutions are seamlessly integrated with our customer contact centers, allowing for the processing of orders through shopping cart, phone, fax, mail, email, live chat and other order receipt methods. As the information backbone for our total supply chain solution, our order to cash service can be used on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with our other business infrastructure offerings, including contact center or order fulfillment services. In addition, for the B2B market, our order to cash platform provides a variety of order receipt methods that facilitate commerce within various stages of the supply chain. Our service provides the ability for both our clients and their customers to track the status of orders at any time. Our services are transparent to our clients’ customers and are seamlessly integrated with our clients’ internal system platforms and websites. By synchronizing these activities, we can capture and provide critical customer information, including:
•Statistical measurements critical to creating a quality customer experience, containing real-time order status, order exceptions, back order tracking, allocation of product based on timing of online purchase and business rules, the ratio of customer inquiries to purchases, average order sizes and order response time;
•B2B supply chain management information critical to evaluating inventory positioning, for the purpose of improving inventory turns, and assessing product flow-through and end-user demand;
•Reverse logistics information, including customer response and reason for the return or rotation of product and desired customer action; and
•Detailed marketing information about what was sold and to whom it was sold, by location and preference
Technology Collaboration. We have created a suite of technology services that enable buyers and suppliers to fully automate their business transactions within their supply chain using our order management interfaces. Our collaboration technologies operate in an open systems environment and feature the use of industry-standard Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) and Service-Oriented Architecture (“SOA”) web services, enabling customized e-commerce solutions with minimal changes to a client’s systems or our systems. The result is a faster implementation process. We also support information exchange methods, such as Applicability Statement 2 (“AS2”), Secure File Transfer Protocol (“SFTP”), Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”), Message Queue Series (“MQ Series”), Application Link Enabling (“ALE”), and Representational State Transfer / Simple Object Access Protocol (“REST/SOAP”) over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (“HTTPS”).
Information Management. We have the ability to communicate with and transfer information to and from our clients through a wide variety of technology services, including real-time web service enabled data interfaces, file transfer methods and electronic data interchange. Our distributed order orchestration systems are designed to capture, store and electronically forward to our clients critical information regarding customer inquiries and orders, product shipments, inventory status (for example, levels of inventory on hand, on backorder, on purchase order and inventory due dates to our warehouse), product returns and other information. Our clients are able to utilize inventory and order information for use in analyzing sales and marketing trends and introducing new products. We also offer customized reports and data analyses based upon specific client needs to assist them in their budgeting.

Payments. Protecting our clients’ brand with secure payment processing and fraud management services is critical to a successful operation. We also provide flexible global payment options as well as gift cards, B2B invoicing and VAT services.
Our payment services are divided into two major financial management areas: 1) billing, credit, collection and cash application services for B2B clients and 2) fraud review, chargeback management and processing and settlement of credit card services for B2C clients.
Business-to-Business Financial Management. For B2B clients, we offer full-service accounts receivable management and collection capabilities, including the ability to generate customized invoices in our clients’ names. We assist clients in reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding, while minimizing costs associated with maintaining an in-house collections staff. We offer electronic credit services in the format of EDI and XML communications direct from our clients to their vendors, suppliers and retailers.
Direct-to-Consumer Financial Management. For B2C clients, we offer secure credit card processing related services for orders made via a client web site or through our customer contact center. We offer manual credit card order review as an additional level of fraud protection. We also calculate sales taxes, goods and services taxes or value added taxes, if applicable, for numerous taxing authorities and on a variety of products. Using third-party leading-edge fraud protection services and risk management systems, we can offer high levels of security and reduce the level of risk for client transactions.
Order Fulfillment
We design advanced distribution operations that streamline our clients’ supply chain process and offer a flexible fulfillment model. Our fulfillment team understands the value of the delivery experience by specializing in creating branded solutions with gift-wrap, product personalization and other value-added services. Our distribution centers are located in the Memphis, Tennessee area, Dallas, Texas, Toronto, Canada, Southampton, U.K., and Liege, Belgium to provide centrally located fulfillment throughout North America and Europe.
Advanced Distribution Facilities and Infrastructure. An integral part of our solution is the warehousing and distribution of our clients’ inventory. We receive inventory in our distribution centers, verify shipment accuracy, unpack and audit packages (a process that includes spot-checking a percentage of the inventory to validate piece counts and check for damages that may have occurred during shipping, loading and unloading). Upon request, we inspect for other damages or defects, which may include checking fabric, stitching and zippers for soft goods, or ‘testing’ power-up capabilities for electronic items as well as product specifications. We generally stock for sale within one business day of unloading. We pick, pack and ship customer orders and can provide customized packaging, customized monogramming, personalized laser engraving, high volume shrink packaging, inserts and promotional literature for distribution with customer orders. For many clients, we provide gift-wrapping services including line level gifting, customized gift-wrapping paper, ribbon, gift-box and gift-messaging.
Our distribution facilities contain computerized sortation equipment, flexible mobile pick-to-light carts, powered material handling equipment and scanning and bar-coding systems. Our distribution facilities include several advanced technology enhancements, such as radio frequency technology in product receiving processing to ensure accuracy, as well as an automated package routing and a pick-to-light paperless order fulfillment system. Our advanced distribution systems provide us with the capability to warehouse an extensive number of stock keeping units (“SKUs”), ranging from large high-end electronics to small cosmetic compacts. Our facilities are flexibly configured to process B2B and DTC orders from the same central location.
In addition to our advanced distribution systems, our proprietary pick-to-light carts, stationary pick-to-light areas and conveyor system controls provide real time productivity reporting, thereby providing our management team with the tools to implement and manage to productivity standards. This combination of computer-controlled equipment provides the seamless integration of our pick-to-light systems and mass sortation capabilities. This unique combination of technologies ensures high order accuracy for each and every customer order.
We are able to take advantage of a variety of shipping and delivery options, which range from next day service to zone skipping, to optimize transportation costs. Our facilities and systems are equipped with multi-carrier functionality, allowing us to integrate with all leading package carriers and provide a comprehensive freight and transportation management offering.
We offer reverse logistics management services, including issuing return authorizations, return carrier shipping labels, receipt of product, crediting customer accounts and disposition of returned product. We also leverage strategic partnerships to provide our clients with access to distributed returns centers that collect, consolidate, report on and forward returned product to our central facilities allowing us to accelerate credits to our clients’ customers, reduce freight costs for our client, improve customer service and reduce complexity and cost in our facilities from handling inbound returns.

Facility Operations and Management. Our facilities management service offering includes distribution facility design and optimization, business process reengineering and ongoing staffing and management. Our expertise in supply chain management, logistics and customer-centric fulfillment operations can provide our clients with cost reductions, process improvements and technology-driven efficiencies.
Kitting and Assembly Services. Our expanded kitting and assembly services enable our clients to reduce the time and costs associated with managing multiple suppliers, warehousing hubs and light manufacturing partners. As a single source provider, we provide the advantage of convenience, accountability and speed. Our kitting and assembly services include light assembly, specialized kitting and supplier-consigned inventory hub either in our distribution facilities or co-located elsewhere. We also offer customized light manufacturing and supplier relationship management.
Pop-Up Distribution Centers. Leveraging our CloudPick℠ solution, temporary fulfillment centers allow our clients’ e-commerce fulfillment networks to flex during peak periods with all the benefits of regional distribution nodes, without the long-term capital costs. We can deploy full pick-pack-ship operations within weeks that run off a simple Wi-Fi network and our proprietary distributed order management technology. Deployed into any real estate space with Wi-Fi, this solution allows for temporary forward stock allocation to alleviate volume from the primary fulfillment center, shorten delivery times and lower shipping costs.
Fulfillment-as-a-Service. PFS has developed and deployed technology products that facilitate the omni-channel shopping experience. Our cloud-based RetailConnectSM Store Edition is designed to streamline the pick/pack/ship operation within a retail store. Our cloud-based solution allows retailers the ability to offer BOPIS (Buy Online, Pick-up In Store) and BOSFS (Buy Online Ship From Store) quickly and accurately, transforming a brick-and-mortar store into an efficient, omi-channel hub which optimizes inventory and improves customer satisfaction.
We work with clients to re-sequence certain supply chain activities to aid in an inventory postponement strategy. We can provide kitting and assembly services and build-to-stock thousands of units daily to stock in a Just-in-Time (“JIT”) environment. This service, for example, can entail the procurement of packaging materials including retail boxes, foam inserts and anti-static bags. These raw material components may be shipped to us from domestic or overseas manufacturers, and we will build the finished SKUs to stock for the client. Also included is the custom configuration of high-end printers and servers. This strategy allows manufacturers to make a smaller investment in base unit inventory while meeting changing customer demand for highly customizable products.
Our standard capabilities include: build-to-order, build-to-stock, expedited orders, passive and active electrostatic discharge (“ESD”) controls, product labeling, serial number generation, marking and/or capture, lot number generation, asset tagging, bill of materials (“BOM”) processing, SKU-level pricing and billing, manufacturing and metrics reporting, first article approval processes and comprehensive quality controls.
Kitting and inventory hub services enable clients to collapse supply chains into the minimal steps necessary to prepare product for distribution to any channel, including wholesale, mass merchant retail or direct to consumer. Clients no longer have to employ multiple providers or require suppliers to consign multiple inventory caches for each channel. We offer our clients the opportunity to consolidate operations from a channel standpoint, as well as from a geographic perspective. Our integrated, global information systems and international locations support business needs worldwide.
Customer Care
Our internal contact center operations are focused on providing essential services such as order entry, returns authorization, product inquiry and order tracking. These operations also include our iCommerce Agent (“iCA”), a customizable web-based application featuring powerful customer service tools for accessing all required customer information. Our unique multi-lingual capabilities are possible through our strategically placed locations in Texas, Belgium, U.K., and Canada, as well as partnerships delivering multi-lingual capability in Mexico. We have also deployed technology which allows for full customer care capabilities to be deployed for agents in a work from home ("WFH") capacity, which has greatly increased our access to skilled staff while reducing attrition. 
Customer Service Application. Through our web enabled iCA application, our unique technology leverages the client’s website investment by wrapping the Customer Service Application around the existing website. Using iCA, agents provide customer service functions, such as placing orders, checking order status, facilitating returns, initiating upsell and cross sell, managing escalations and gathering “voice of the customer” information to help our clients evolve with their customers’ changing needs. iCA is fully integrated into the client’s website, our data analytics platform, and our order processing system, allowing full visibility into customer history and customer trends. Through each of our customer touch-points, information can be analyzed and processed for current or future use in business evaluation product effectiveness and positioning, and supply chain planning. 
Table of Contents

Through this fully integrated system, we are able to provide a complete customer care solution in a contact center or on a license basis to our clients’ owned or outsourced contact centers.
Customer Assistance. An important feature of evolving commerce is the ability for the customer to communicate with a live customer service representative. Our experience has been that many consumers tell us they visited a web location for information, but not all of those consumers chose to place their order online. Our contact center services utilize features that integrate voice, e-mail, standard mail and live chat communications to respond to and handle customer inquiries. Our customer care representatives answer various questions, acting as virtual representatives of our clients’ organization, regarding order status, shipping, billing, returns and product information and availability as well as a variety of other questions. We utilize technology that allows us to route each customer contact automatically to the appropriate customer care representative who is individually trained in the clients’ business and products.
Our contact centers are flexibly designed so that our customer care representatives can handle either several different clients and products in a shared agent environment, thereby creating economy of scale benefits for our clients, or through a highly customized dedicated agent support model that provides the ultimate customer experience and brand reinforcement.
Quality Monitoring. Quality is essential in our client solutions. As representatives of our clients, our customer care representatives must adhere to the unique quality standards of each client for each contact type. We continually monitor the quality of our customer care representatives against each client quality standard and use the results to provide agent-level feedback to continually improve the customer care experience. Clients may participate in the quality process by remotely listening to calls, assisting in the grading of recorded calls and providing ongoing direction to improve quality standards through our calibration process.
Customer Self-Help. With the need for efficiency and cost optimization for many of our clients, we have integrated interactive voice response (“IVR”) as another option for customer contacts. IVR creates an “electronic workforce” with virtual agents that can assist customers with vital information at any time of the day or night. IVR allows for our clients’ customers to deal interactively with our system to handle basic customer inquiries, such as account balance, order status, shipment status and customer satisfaction surveys. The inclusion of IVR in our service offering allows us to offer a cost effective way to handle high volume, low complexity calls.
INDUSTRY INFORMATION AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Industry Overview
Business activities in the public and private sectors continue to operate in an environment of rapid technological advancement, increasing competition and continuous pressure to decrease costs by improving operating and supply chain efficiency. We currently see the following trends within the industry:
•Manufacturers strive to restructure their supply chains to maximize efficiency and reduce costs in both B2B and B2C markets, and to create a variable-cost supply chain able to support the multiple, unique needs of each of their initiatives, including traditional retail and e-commerce.
•Companies in a variety of industries seek outsourcing as a method to address one or more business functions that are not within their core business competencies, to reduce operating costs or to improve the speed or cost of implementation.
•Retailers, both traditional and e-commerce only, partner with providers that offer them the most flexibility both short and long-term. The end-to-end model is a viable option for brands that are growing their e-commerce channel, or for large wholesale corporations that do not have the infrastructure to handle B2C transactions. However, many companies today seek to diversify their e-commerce operations across in-house capabilities and outsourced components on an a la carte basis.  
•The “seamless customer experience” is a major industry trend that retailers and brand manufacturers are embracing to differentiate and remain relevant to a more sophisticated consumer. As consumers desire a shopping experience that blends sales channels, the integration and flexibility of front and back-end systems and operations becomes more critical to retailers and manufacturers.
•As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in e-commerce growth. Manufacturing and retailers are focused on driving improvements in their online presence through incremental 
Table of Contents

investments in their website presence and infrastructure to support evolving consumer buying patterns and requirements. 
Supply Chain Management Trend
As companies maintain focus on improving their businesses and balance sheet financial ratios, significant efforts and investments continue to be made in identifying ways to maximize supply chain efficiency and extend supply chain processes. Working capital financing, vendor managed inventory, supply chain visibility software solutions, distribution channel skipping, direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales initiatives and complex upstream supply chain collaborative technology are products that manufacturers seek to help them achieve greater supply chain efficiency.
A key business challenge facing many manufacturers and retailers as they evaluate their supply chain efficiency is determining how the trend toward increased omni-channel business activity will impact their traditional B2C commerce business models. Ship-from-store, pick-up-in-store, return-to-store and other omni-channel capabilities are becoming increasingly important processes to accommodate. We believe manufacturers will look to outsource their non-core competency functions to support this modified business model. We believe companies will continue to strategically plan for the impact that technology advancements will have on their traditional commerce business models and their existing technology and infrastructure capabilities. Additionally, B2B opportunities exist as companies look to leverage the technology and enhanced customer experience that currently exists within e-commerce channels.
Manufacturers, as buyers of materials, are also imposing new business practices and policies on their supplier partners to shift the normal supply chain costs and risks associated with inventory ownership away from their own balance sheets. Through techniques like Vendor Managed Inventory or Consigned Inventory Programs, manufacturers are asking their suppliers, as a part of the supplier selection process, to provide capabilities where the manufacturer need not own, or even possess, inventory prior to the exact moment that unit of inventory is required as a raw material component or for shipping to a customer. To be successful for all parties, business models such as these often require a sophisticated collection of technological capabilities that allow for complete integration and collaboration of the information technology environments of both the buyer and supplier. For example, for an inventory unit to arrive at the precise required moment in the manufacturing facility, it is necessary for the Manufacturing Resource Planning systems of the manufacturer to integrate with the CRM systems of the supplier. When hundreds of supplier partners are involved, this process can become quite complex and technologically challenging. Buyers and suppliers are seeking solutions that utilize XML based protocols and traditional EDI standards to ensure an open systems platform that promote easier technology integration in these collaborative solutions. In addition to these traditional integration and collaboration technology environments, we are observing the emergence of a variety of solutions utilizing blockchain technologies and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate time to include emerging technology solutions into our service offering.

In response to growing competitive pressures and technological innovations, we believe many companies, both large and small, are focusing their critical resources on the core competencies of their business and utilizing e-commerce service providers to accelerate their business plans in a cost-effective manner and perform non-core business functions. Outsourcing can provide many key benefits, including the ability to:
•Enter new business markets or geographic areas rapidly;
•Increase flexibility to meet changing business conditions and demand for products and services;
•Enhance customer satisfaction and gain competitive advantage;
•Reduce capital and personnel investments and convert fixed investments to variable costs;
•Improve operating performance and efficiency; and
•Capitalize on skills, expertise and technology infrastructure that would otherwise be unavailable or expensive given the scale of the business.
Typically, many outsourcing service providers are focused on a single function, such as information technology, contact center management, credit card processing, warehousing or package delivery, etc. This focus creates several challenges for companies looking to outsource more than one of these functions, including the need to manage multiple outsourcing service providers, to share information with service providers and to integrate that information into their internal systems. Additionally, the delivery of these multiple services must be transparent to the customer so the client maintains brand recognition and customer

loyalty. Furthermore, traditional commerce outsourcers are frequently providers of domestic-only services versus international solutions. As a result, companies requiring global solutions must establish additional relationships with other outsourcing parties.
Another vital point for major brand name companies seeking to outsource is the protection of their brand. When looking for an outsourcing partner to provide infrastructure solutions, brand name companies must find a company that can provide the same quality performance and superior experience their customers expect from their brands. Working with an outsourcing partner requires finding a partner that can maintain the consistency of their brand image, which is one of the most valuable intangible assets that recognized brand name companies possess.
Competition
We face competition from many different sources depending upon the type and range of services requested by a potential client. Many other companies offer one or more of the same services we provide on an individual basis. For operations services, our competitors include vertical outsourcers, which are companies that offer a single function solution. We compete with transportation logistics providers, known in the industry as 3PL’s and 4PL’s (third or fourth party logistics providers), who offer product management functions as an ancillary service to their primary transportation services. For professional services, we compete against Global Commerce Service Providers, and Specialists, who perform various services similar to our solution offerings. Additionally, we see competition from digital agencies providing creative, commerce strategy and system integration services. In many instances, PFSweb competes with the in-house operations of our potential clients. Occasionally, the operations departments of potential clients believe they can perform the same services we do, at similar quality levels and costs, while others are reluctant to outsource business functions that involve direct customer contact. We cannot be certain we will be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors in the future.
Although many of our competitors offer one or more of our services, we believe our primary competitive advantage is our ability to offer a full array of customized services, thereby eliminating any need for our clients to coordinate these services from many different providers. We believe we can differentiate ourselves by offering our clients a very broad range of e-commerce and business process services that address, in many cases, the entire value chain, from demand to delivery.
We also compete on the basis of many other important additional factors, including:
•vertical industry expertise;
•omni-channel strategy; 
•design and implementation experience;
•operating performance and reliability;
•ease of implementation and integration;
•experience of the people required to successfully and efficiently design and implement solutions;
•experience operating similar solutions dynamically;
•scalable and secure technology experience across all major commerce packages;
•global reach; and
•price. 
We believe we can compete favorably with respect to many of these factors. However, the market for our services is competitive and continually evolving, which will require PFSweb to continue to innovate and invest in both its LiveArea Professional Services and PFS Operations business units to be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.

COMPANY INFORMATION
Clients and Marketing
Our target clients include traditional retailers, online retailers and leading technology and consumer goods brands looking to quickly and efficiently implement or enhance online and offline business initiatives and operations, adapt their digital strategies or introduce new products, programs or geographies, without the burden of modifying or expanding their technology, customer care, supply chain and logistics infrastructure. Our solutions are applicable to a multitude of industries and company types and we have provided solutions for such companies as:
Procter & Gamble (consumer packaged goods), L’Oréal USA (health & beauty), ASICS (sporting goods/apparel), Thrive Causemetics (health & beauty), Ricoh (printer supplies), Ralph Lauren (fashion), Xerox (printers and printer supplies), PANDORA (jewelry), Moleskine (stationery), Tommy Bahama (fashion), Anastasia Beverly Hills (health & beauty), The United States Mint (collectible coins), among many others.
We target potential clients through an extensive integrated marketing program comprised of a variety of direct marketing techniques, email marketing initiatives, trade event participation, search engine marketing, public relations, social media, thought leadership, and a sophisticated outbound tele-sales lead generation model. We have also developed a global business development methodology which allows us to effectively showcase our various commerce service solutions and products. We also pursue strategic marketing alliances with consulting firms, private equity firms, software manufacturers and other logistics providers to increase market awareness and generate referrals and customer leads.
Because of the highly complex nature of the solutions we provide, our clients demand significant competence and experience from a variety of different business disciplines during the sales cycle. As such, we often utilize a member of our executive team to lead the design and proposal development of each potential new client we choose to pursue. The executive is supported by a select group of highly experienced individuals from our professional services group with specific industry knowledge of, or experience with, the solutions development process. We employ a team of highly trained implementation managers whose responsibilities include the oversight and supervision of client projects and maintaining high levels of client satisfaction during the transition process between the various stages of the sales cycle and steady state operations.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonality due to our client mix and their increased business volumes which are highest in our fourth quarter which coincides with the retail peak season. We cannot predict the volume of sales of our clients or the impact of such seasonality of our clients or the sales they will implement during such peak season nor those of any future client business. We expect this seasonality to continue, or possibly increase in the future, which may cause fluctuations in our business operations and operating. Increased online buying due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions drove substantially increased fulfillment volume in the second quarter of 2020 with continued high growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 as well. 
Concentration of Clients
During 2020, one of our clients represented more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated total net revenues. The client represented $38.9 million, or 11%, of consolidated total revenues. The client utilizes the services offered by both the LiveArea and PFS Operations segments.

Workforce Composition and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our business is operated by a diverse and global workforce, with employees in the following key geographies as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):

North America: | 
United States | 1,400
Canada | 70 
Total | 1,470
Europe: | 
United Kingdom | 170 
Belgium | 150 
Bulgaria | 50 
Total | 370 
Asia: | 
India | 290 
Total Employees | 2,130

We believe that providing a diverse workplace that promotes mutual respect and inclusion for all employees is critical to our business success and to driving innovation and growth. Since 2018, all US employees were trained on diversity and inclusion. In 2019, this training was expanded to our non-US employees and managers. In 2020, we launched an expanded Diversity & Inclusion effort and hired a firm to help develop a phased approach to increase diversity and ensure inclusion. As part of this process, the Company is engaging its workforce and seeking feedback from various groups within the Company, including, but not limited to, women, African Americans, and LGBTQ employees, to better determine if there are areas within the Company that warrant changes. We continue to work through the phased approach and believe this is an ongoing effort that will drive permanent change in our Company and our practices. As of December 31, 2020:
•globally, women make up approximately 49.5% of our workforce and hold approximately 32.2% of management roles.
•in the US, people of color represent approximately 69.2% of our workforce and hold approximately 44.6% of US management roles.
We are an equal opportunity employer and comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, including but not limited to the applicable provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We prohibit and do not tolerate discrimination against our employees, applicants, or any protected group or class including in our hiring, workplace practices, promotions, compensation, benefits, and termination practices. 
We have never suffered an interruption of business as a result of a labor dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In the U.S., Canada and India, we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and while our European subsidiaries are not a party to a collective-bargaining agreement, certain of them are required to comply with certain rules agreed upon by their employee Works Councils.
Our success in recruiting, hiring and training large numbers of skilled employees and obtaining large numbers of hourly employees and temporary staff during peak periods for distribution and call center operations is critical to our ability to provide high quality services. 
Health and Safety
Our frontline employees provide essential services to keep goods flowing to the people who need them. Their protection is important, and with the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we began using a combination of protective measures and virtual communications to maintain a safe workplace environment including, but not limited to: 
•Temperature checks at entry doors;
•Personal protective equipment (“PPE”) for all employees; and
•Mobile cleaning stations and access to hand sanitizers.

Government Regulation
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection laws and data privacy laws, protecting our customers’ personally identifiable information and other non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices to name a few. Moreover, there is a trend toward regulations requiring companies to provide consumers with greater information regarding, and greater control over, how their personal data is used, and requiring notification when unauthorized access to such data occurs. Furthermore, the growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens and greater penalties on online companies. 
These laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines and other penalties. For example, many states and foreign countries currently require us to notify each of our clients or customers who are affected by any data security breach in which an unauthorized person, such as a computer hacker, who could obtain customer information. In addition, several jurisdictions, including foreign countries, have adopted privacy-related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited email promotions, commonly known as “spam,” that impose significant monetary and other penalties for violations. Two such governmental regulations that have significant implications for our products and services are the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and in January 2023 the newly adopted California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) will come into effect. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report, specifically, We must safeguard the security and privacy of our client’s confidential data and remain in compliance with laws that govern such data and we may be liable for misappropriation of our client’s and our clients’ customers’ personal information, including through cyber-attacks.
In an effort to comply with these laws, internet service providers may increasingly block legitimate marketing emails. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and a time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules in the future which could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
The U.K.’s exit from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”) may add cost and complexity to our operations and compliance efforts. Brexit has and may continue to contribute to volatility of currency exchange rates, including of the euro and British pound, issues with import and export controls, trade barriers, tariffs, and the movement of employees due to lack of enforceable trade agreements and uniform regulations. The U.K. is an important geography for us and we have structured our privacy and data protection compliance program based on the GDPR. As a result of Brexit, we will be required to implement alternative U.K. compliance measures and comply separately to the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act of 2018.
