ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  Overview MicroVision, Inc. is a pioneer in laser beam scanning (LBS) technology that we market under our brand name PicoP®. We have developed our proprietary PicoP® scanning technology that can be adopted by our customers to create high-resolution miniature projection and three-dimensional sensing and image capture solutions. PicoP® scanning technology is based on our patented expertise in micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS), laser diodes, opto-mechanics, and electronics and how those elements are packaged into a small form factor, low power scanning engine that can display, interact and sense, depending on the needs of the application. For display, the engine can project a high-quality image on any surface (pico projection), a windshield (head-up display or HUD), or a retina (augmented reality or AR). For sensing, we use infrared (IR) lasers to capture three-dimensional data in the form of a point cloud. Interactivity uses the 3D sensing function and the display function to project an image that the user can then interact with as one would a touch screen. We have licensed our patented PicoP® scanning technology to other companies for incorporation into their scanning engines for projection. We sell our licensees key components needed to produce their laser scanning engines and/or license our technology in exchange for a royalty fee for each scanning engine they sell. Companies to whom we license our PicoP® scanning technology are typically original design manufacturers (ODMs) or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who are in the business of making components or products ready for sale to end users. To date, we have primarily focused on the consumer electronics market, however, we believe that our LBS technology creates a platform that can support multiple applications and markets including enterprise, medical, industrial and automotive.  In November 2016, we announced a growth strategy for 2017 and beyond that includes selling LBS engines to ODMs and OEMs in addition to our strategy of licensing LBS technology to licensees to offer their own solutions. We plan to offer three scanning engines to support a wide array of applications: a small form factor display engine for consumer products, an interactive display engine for smart Internet of Things (IoT) products, and a mid-range light detection and ranging (LiDAR) engine for autonomous vehicles, industrial products and robotics.  While we are optimistic about our technology and the potential for future revenues, we have incurred substantial losses since inception and we expect to incur a significant loss during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.  MicroVision, Inc. was founded in 1993 as a Washington corporation and reincorporated in 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our headquarters is located at 6244 185th Avenue NE, Suite 100, Redmond, Washington 98052, and our telephone number is (425) 936-6847.  Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are available free-of-charge from the investor page of our website, accessible at www.microvision.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC directly at 1-800-SEC-0330 (1-800-732-0330). In addition, the SEC maintains a website, www.sec.gov, which contains current, quarterly and annual reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.  1   
Technology Our patented PicoP® scanning technology combines a MEMS scanning mirror, laser diode light sources, electronics, and optics that are controlled using our proprietary system control algorithms. The bi-directional MEMS scanning mirror is a key component of our technology platform and is one of our core competencies. We also have patents for two mirror MEMS solutions. Our most recent MEMS design is a silicon device with a one millimeter mirror at the center. This mirror is connected to small flexures that allow it to oscillate vertically and horizontally to capture (sensing) or reproduce (display) an image pixel-by-pixel. Scanning engines with our technology can operate in three modes: display only, display and sensing combined, and sensing only. For applications that include a projected display, our PicoP® scanning technology creates a brilliant, full color, high-contrast, uniform image over the entire field-of-view from a small and thin engine with low power consumption. For 3D scanning applications, our engine is also small, high resolution, and low power with the low lag and low persistence features that are important for such applications. We believe that our proprietary technology offers significant advantages over traditional display and 3D sensing systems. Depending on the specific product application, these advantages may include: 
Ability to perform projection and three-dimensional sensing and image capture from a single device;
Leveraging our custom MEMS and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICS) components across multiple engine types for economies of scale;
Focus-free operation;
HD resolution;
Low power requirements to enable battery operated devices and applications;
Large screen size up to 200 inches from short distances;
Small and thin engine size;
80,000:1 contrast ratio with true black; 
High-brightness, high-dynamic range, and brightness uniformity;
Rich, saturated color reproduction;
Short throw projection with multi-mode operation for table top and wall mode;
3D sensing as a touch interface or point cloud;
Real-time interactive capture of moving targets;
Dynamic, programmable resolution and frame rate 3D scanning; and
Expandable 90, 180, 270 and 360 degree coverage for LiDAR applications. In addition to these advantages, an overarching benefit of our PicoP® scanning technology is its ability to offer a key combination of lumens per-watt per-cubic centimeter: in essence, more lumens at lower power in a smaller form factor. Competing technologies may offer more lumens in total but not in as small and power efficient design as our PicoP® scanning technology. This combination is of particular importance for small, portable devices operated by battery. Equally important for consumer ease-of-use and for mobile projection applications is the focus-free attribute of our PicoP® scanning technology.  Business Strategy Our business strategy is to commercialize our PicoP® scanning technology by enabling ODMs and OEMs to produce end-user products via three go-to-market paths: 
Design and sell LBS engines directly to ODMs and OEMs to incorporate inside their products;
License our LBS technology and sell key components to ODMs and OEMs to create their own scanning engines; and
License LBS technology to ODMs and OEMs who developed their own key components.  By providing these options, we permit ODMs and OEMs to integrate and embed our technology across a broad range of display and 3D sensing product applications in the way that best matches their technical capabilities and timelines for bringing their products to market. We create product concept reference designs to enable ODMs and OEMs to develop and rapidly build products that capitalize on the benefits of our PicoP® scanning technology for many of the applications we promote for our technology. We are also developing value-added features intended to help our customers differentiate their potential products.  2    We pursue cooperative marketing and development relationships with suppliers and other companies interested in growing the LBS market to extend the reach of our team and strengthen our position in the market. In 2016, we announced a co-marketing relationship with ST Microelectronics that includes joint sales and marketing activities for LBS solutions.  The key elements of our business strategy include the following: 
Continue to improve the performance of our PicoP® scanning technology platform by advancing the key application attributes such as higher brightness for displays, lower power,
smaller size, and greater accuracy and longer distances for 3D sensing;
Develop value-added features and applications that complement our core technology;
Partner with ODMs and OEMs to help them develop scanning engines based on our technology or to select an engine to purchase from our offerings, and to help them integrate the engines
into their products;
Support ODMs and supply partners to ensure availability of high quality scanning engines in quantities to support the consumer electronics market; 
Supply scanning engines for ODMs and OEMs who opt to buy rather than build engines as licensees for their products;
Supply key scanning engine components for products being developed by ODMs and OEMs who license our PicoP® scanning technology and/or license rights to ODMs and OEMs to
produce such components; 
Partner with other companies that are interested in growing the LBS market to cooperatively promote our solutions and develop solutions for future products and capabilities where
appropriate; and
Maintain a position of LBS leadership with our intellectual property around our PicoP® scanning technology.  Markets for Our Technology Our PicoP® scanning technology platform strategy is focused on addressing four primary market segments:  
Pico projection/interactive pico projection;
3D sensing for automotive and industrial applications; 
Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR); and 
Head up displays (HUD) for automobiles.  We see pico projection, interactive pico projection and short range 3D sensing as the most promising applications for our technology in the near to mid-term. We expect AR/VR and HUD to be mid to long-term opportunities. We have concentrated on pico projection over the past several years and, in 2016, we announced plans for other engine solutions for interactive pico projection and 3D sensing. We also began a development program in late 2016 with a leading technology company for an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) proof-of-concept demonstrator. We believe AR and VR eyewear displays can also benefit from our technology, and we are actively exploring these opportunities. In 2016, we were engaged by another leading technology company to develop a proof-of-concept demonstrator for an AR application. In the automotive HUD market, we have supported customer evaluations for an LBS HUD. In pico projection, our goal is to enable a large screen viewing experience produced by a small projector for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronics products. The scanning engine can either be embedded in the mobile device directly or in a small standalone companion product that is paired with the mobile device wirelessly or via a protocol such as HDMI. These potential products would allow users to watch digital videos, play games, and display images and other data onto a variety of surfaces, freeing users from the limitations of a small screen. Products that incorporate our PicoP® scanning technology have been announced and brought to market by our licensees and their customers in 2016.  We believe combining interactivity with projection can enable a whole new category of smart IoT products. Our engine, which combines interactivity and projection in a single, integrated module supports time-of-flight (ToF) 3D sensing, can act as a touch interface with the projected image, mimicking the experience users are accustomed to with a smartphone of tablet touchscreen.  For the automotive market, an engine using our PicoP® scanning technology could be combined with other components and systems to form a HUD system to be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable, standalone aftermarket HUD. We have produced prototypes that demonstrate the ability of PicoP® scanning technology to project high-resolution virtual images in the driver's field-of-view, providing the driver with a variety of information related to the vehicle's operation. The small form factor display engine we plan to offer in 2017 is well suited to aftermarket HUD products.  3    We have also begun to investigate opportunities to apply our technology to emerging applications for in-car connectivity and infotainment systems and our mid-range LiDAR engine can be integrated into autonomous vehicles and vehicle ADAS applications for 3D special measurement and navigation assistance. Another possible application area for our PicoP® scanning technology that we have refocused on in the past year is eyewear displays, also known as AR and VR. We have a long history with this application, and the eyewear ecosystem has progressed to a point where we see future growth opportunities. We are in the exploratory phases with prospective customers in identifying which AR and VR applications offer the most promise for our technology inside their future products.  In addition to display and projection applications, our PicoP® scanning technology has the ability to capture and sense three-dimensional information. We believe there are market opportunities to use our technology to capture images and sense objects. There are multiple methods of performing 3D image capture and sensing using our LBS technology. The first we plan to commercialize is time of flight (ToF), which we are incorporating into our interactive display engine as well as our mid-range LiDAR engine. In addition to the automotive applications discussed above, the mid-range LiDAR engine could enable machine vision for robots, drones, industrial vehicles, and applications.  Products and Services In 2015 and 2016, our revenue was primarily derived from the sale of our proprietary components and license and royalty fees for PicoP® scanning technology. The key components we offer for inclusion in an LBS engine are our MEMS and ASICs. Our licensees can purchase none, some, or all of the key components we offer depending on their capability and desire to manufacture them and the terms of the licensing agreement. Our planned 2017 engine product offerings are targeted to a wide variety of ODMs and OEMs for multiple applications, and they consist of: 
A small form factor, high definition display engine for applications where form factor and flexibility of product design are required;
An interactive display engine that integrates display and 3D sensing to allow the user to interact with projected images; and
A mid-range LiDAR engine for autonomous, industrial products and robotics.  We began delivering samples of the display engine to customers in December 2016 and expect to be ready for mass production with that engine in the second quarter of 2017. For the interactive display engine, we expect to begin delivering engine samples in the second quarter of 2017 with mass production readiness in the third quarter. We anticipate having samples of the mid-range LiDAR engine in the second half of 2017 and be mass production ready in the first half of 2018. In addition to product sales and license and royalty fees, we generate revenue from engineering services for custom development and support services for our customers. Historically, our engineering services from collaborative research and development and contract agreements have been a significant portion of our total revenue. In 2015, we transitioned our business to focus more to product sales and royalty revenue, and engineering services has become a smaller part of our business. We expect product sales and royalty revenue to be a significant portion of our total revenue in the future. Research and Development We believe our research and development efforts have earned us a leadership position in the field of LBS technology and applications as applied to consumer electronics, automotive and other markets. Our ability to attract customers and grow revenue will depend on our ability to maintain our LBS technology leadership, to continually improve performance, reduce costs, reduce the size of component parts and scanning engines, and to increase the number of applications and products enabled by our PicoP® scanning technology. Our research and development team is located in Redmond, Washington and as of December 31, 2016, was comprised of 49 engineering and technical staff in optics, computer vision, software engineering, electrical engineering, and MEMS design.  4   
Sales and Marketing Our sales and marketing approach is account based, business-to-business targeting of ODMs and OEMs. We license our PicoP® scanning technology and sell components used in the production of scanning engines to our licensees and sell scanning engines to our customers. Our customers are typically companies that want to buy or build LBS engines for incorporation into their products. We also engage end product manufacturers and retailers in our target markets to educate them about product opportunities based on our PicoP® scanning technology. We currently have sales and business development representatives based in the United States and several parts of Asia, focused on business development in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our sales and business development representatives are supported by a technical sales engineering team that assists customers during the "design win" and "design in" cycles. The technical sales engineering team operates from Redmond, Washington, Taiwan and Japan. Our marketing team is located in Redmond, Washington. We engage potential customers directly, participate in trade shows, use social media, and maintain a website and cooperate on co-marketing activities with key partners.  Manufacturing We currently use contract manufacturers to produce the products we sell. Our products include scanning engines as well as components that are integral to a scanning engine incorporating our PicoP® scanning technology and include MEMS and ASICs that incorporate our designs and are produced to order by semiconductor foundries. In addition to our business of licensing technology and selling components, beginning in 2017, we expect our product offerings to include scanning engine products manufactured by a contract manufacturer based on our proprietary design. Our manufacturing is not currently subject to seasonal variations as our shipments have been relatively small and are in the early stages of product introduction. In the future, depending on our customers' product mix, we may be affected by seasonal fluctuations which could affect working capital demands.  We provide forecasts that allow our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials and plan capacity. Our contract manufacturers procure raw materials in volumes consistent with our forecasts, manufacture and/or assemble the products and perform tests according to our specifications. Products are either shipped to our customers or shipped to our Redmond, Washington headquarters to be inventoried as finished goods. We procure some specific components and either sell them or consign them to our contract manufacturers. We hold some inventories of these components. Our contract manufacturers procure additional raw materials we do not own when the finished goods are completed by our contract manufacturer. Title to the products transfers from our contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from the manufacturer. If raw materials are unused, or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for component parts that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecasts or customer orders. Many of the raw materials used in our components are standard to the consumer electronics industry. Our MEMS, MEMS die, and ASICs are currently manufactured to our specifications by separate single-source suppliers. Human Factors, Ergonomics and Safety We work with third party independent experts in the field of laser safety to assist in meeting safety specifications. In addition, we monitor developments in the area of permissible laser exposure limits as established by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and others. Independent experts have concluded that laser exposure to the eye resulting from use of LBS devices under normal operating conditions would be below the calculated maximum permissible exposure level set by the IEC. Competitive Conditions The information display and 3D sensing industries are highly competitive. Potential products incorporating our PicoP® scanning technology, including any LBS engines we develop, will compete with manufacturers of established technologies, such as flat panel display devices, as well as companies developing new display and 3D sensing technologies.  5    Our competitors include companies such as Texas Instruments, Intel, Syndiant, Velodyne, Quanargy, Innoluce, Opus, Mirrorcle, Maradin, Himax, Pioneer, Sony (LCOS) and others, some of which have much greater financial, technical and other resources than us. Many of our competitors are currently developing alternative miniature display and 3D sensing technologies. Our competitors may succeed in developing innovative technologies and products that could render our technology or our proposed products commercially infeasible or technologically obsolete. Pico projectors are a class of miniaturized projectors that are generally handheld, battery operated, mobile projectors. Most of the competing projectors currently on the market are either liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) panel solutions or Texas Instruments' DLP™ display technology primarily using light-emitting diode (LED) light sources. Each of these projection solutions can create images of varying resolution, brightness, image quality, battery life, and ease-of-use. The information display and 3D sensing industries have been characterized by rapid and significant technological advances. Our PicoP® scanning technology platform and potential products may not remain competitive with such advances, and we may not have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies, products or processes. Although we believe our technology platform and proposed products could deliver images of a substantially higher quality and resolution from a smaller form factor device than those of commercially available LCOS and DLP based display products, manufacturers of competing technologies may develop further improvements to screen display technology that could reduce or eliminate the anticipated advantages of our proposed products.  3D sensing is a new market for us and we believe we are developing products that will have cost and performance benefits over what competitors may offer. However, manufacturers of competing technologies may develop further improvements to size of their modules, performance for mid-range LiDAR and lower costs that could reduce or eliminate the anticipated advantages of our proposed products.  Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights We create intellectual property from three sources: internal research and development activities, technology acquisitions, and performance on development contracts. The inventions covered by our patent applications generally relate to systems controls in our PicoP® scanning technology, component miniaturization, power reduction, feature enhancements, specific implementation of various system components, and design elements to facilitate mass production. Protecting these key-enabling technologies and components is a fundamental aspect of our strategy to penetrate diverse markets with unique products. As such, we intend to continue to develop our portfolio of proprietary and patented LBS technologies at the system, component, and process levels. We believe our extensive patent portfolio is the largest, broadest, and earliest filed LBS technology portfolio and includes applications such as automotive HUD, augmented reality, range finding, portable media devices, image capture, and projection applications. We have over 500 issued patents, pending patents and licensed patents worldwide. Since our inception in 1993, we have acquired under license agreements exclusive rights to various LBS technologies, including, among others, rights related to the ability to superimpose images on the user's field-of-view with a retinal display, and rights related to the design and fabrication of micro-miniature devices using semiconductor fabrication techniques. In some cases, the licensors have retained limited, non-commercial rights with respect to the technology, including the right to use the technology for non-commercial research and for instructional purposes.  Our ability to compete effectively in the information display and 3D sensing markets may depend, in part, on our ability and the ability of our licensors to maintain the proprietary nature of these technologies. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees, and where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non-compete agreements. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.  We have registered the name "PicoP®" and "MicroVision®" with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.   6   
Employees As of February 27, 2017, we had 81 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
