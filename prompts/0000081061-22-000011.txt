Item 1. Business
Publix Super Markets, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Company) are in the business of operating retail food supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia. The Company plans to expand its retail operations into Kentucky in 2023. The Company was founded in 1930 and has no other significant lines of business or industry segments.
Merchandising and manufacturing
The Company sells a variety of merchandise which includes grocery (including dairy, produce, floral, deli, bakery, meat and seafood), health and beauty care, general merchandise, pharmacy and other products and services. This merchandise includes nationally advertised and private label brands as well as unbranded products such as produce, meat and seafood. Private label items are produced in the Company’s dairy, bakery and deli manufacturing facilities or are manufactured for the Company by suppliers. The Company receives the food and nonfood products it sells from many sources. The Company believes its sources of supply for these products and the raw materials used in manufacturing are adequate for its needs and that it is not dependent upon a single supplier or relatively few suppliers. Merchandise is delivered to the supermarkets through Company distribution centers or directly from suppliers and is generally available in sufficient quantities to enable the Company to satisfy its customers. The cost of merchandise delivered to the supermarkets through the Company’s distribution centers is approximately 74% of the total product costs. The coronavirus pandemic has impacted the Company’s sources of supply, product mix and the availability of certain products. However, the Company has generally been able to secure alternative sources of supply to serve the needs of its customers. The future impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sources of supply, product mix and customer demand is uncertain and difficult to predict.
Store operations
The Company operated 1,293 supermarkets at the end of 2021, compared with 1,264 at the beginning of the year. In 2021, 45 supermarkets were opened (including 10 replacement supermarkets) and 134 supermarkets were remodeled. Sixteen supermarkets were closed during the period. The replacement supermarkets that opened in 2021 replaced six supermarkets closed in 2021 and four supermarkets closed in a previous period. Nine supermarkets closed in 2021 will be replaced on site in a subsequent period and one supermarket will not be replaced. Net new supermarkets added 1.3 million square feet in 2021, an increase of 2.2%. At the end of 2021, the Company had 830 supermarkets located in Florida, 194 in Georgia, 82 in Alabama, 65 in South Carolina, 52 in Tennessee, 51 in North Carolina and 19 in Virginia. Also, at the end of 2021, the Company had 24 supermarkets under construction in Florida, eight in Georgia, six in Alabama, three in South Carolina and three in Tennessee.
Competition
The Company is engaged in the highly competitive retail food industry. The Company’s competitors include traditional supermarkets, such as national and regional supermarket chains and independent supermarkets, as well as nontraditional competitors, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, drug stores, specialty food stores, restaurants, convenience stores and online retailers. The Company’s ability to attract and retain customers is based primarily on quality of goods and service, price, convenience, product mix and store location. 
Seasonality
The historical influx of winter residents to Florida and increased purchases of products during the traditional Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter holidays typically result in seasonal sales increases from November to April of each year. However, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on travel, tourism and consumer spending may affect the Company’s seasonal sales.
Human capital resources
Employee Ownership
The Company is the largest employee-owned company in the U.S. with 232,000 employees at the end of 2021. The Company is dedicated to the dignity, value and employment security of its employees and recognizes they are its most important asset and primary competitive advantage. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
Career Development
The Company believes in promoting its employees from within and is committed to providing them with many opportunities for advancing their careers. Almost all of the Company’s employees in leadership positions began their Publix careers in entry level positions. Continuous on-the-job training plays an important role in helping employees develop the skills necessary to advance their careers. The Company also offers tuition reimbursement designed to encourage and assist eligible associates in continuing their education. Additionally, the Company invests in the development of its employees through training and leadership development programs to support their career advancement.
Community Involvement
The Company is committed to community involvement, with a primary focus of helping alleviate hunger in the communities it serves. Since 2009, the Company has donated more than $2 billion in food to food banks and other nonprofit organizations. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been an increased need for this effort. As a result, the Company launched an initiative to purchase produce and milk from local farmers and deliver the products to food banks for those in need. The Company extended this commitment by implementing its Feeding More Together program. Through this program, customer donations at the registers enable food banks to purchase nonperishable products they need most. The Company matches the customer donations by purchasing an equivalent dollar value of produce from farmers and donating it to the food banks. The Company is also involved in many other community activities and programs in the areas it serves. 
Intellectual property
The Company’s trademarks, trade names, copyrights and similar intellectual property are important to the success of the Company’s business. Numerous trademarks, including “Publix” and “Where Shopping is a Pleasure,” have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Due to the importance of its intellectual property to its business, the Company actively defends and enforces its rights to such property.
Government regulation
The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects and impose liabilities for the costs of contamination cleanup and damages arising from sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous materials. The Company may be held responsible for the remediation of environmental conditions regardless of whether the Company leases, subleases or owns the supermarkets or other facilities and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the Company or a prior owner or tenant. In addition to environmental laws and regulations, the Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, product labeling and safety, zoning, land use, workplace safety, public health, accessibility and restrictions on the sale of various products, including alcoholic beverages, tobacco and drugs. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations governing its relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, disabled access and work permit requirements. Compliance with these laws and regulations had no material effect on capital expenditures, results of operations or the competitive position of the Company.
