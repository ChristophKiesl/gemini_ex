Item 1. Business
Corporate History and Background
We were incorporated on October 22, 2018 as RMG Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
On October 5, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), with RMG Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and Romeo Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Romeo”). On December 29, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the business combination with Legacy Romeo was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Romeo, with Legacy Romeo surviving as the surviving company and as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name to Romeo Power, Inc.
Overview
We are an industry leading energy storage technology company focused on designing and manufacturing lithium-ion battery modules and packs for vehicle electrification. Through our energy dense battery modules and packs, we enable large-scale sustainable transportation by delivering safe, longer lasting batteries that have shorter charge times and longer life. With greater energy density, we are able to create lightweight and efficient solutions that deliver superior performance and provide improved acceleration, range and durability compared to battery packs provided by our competitors. Our modules and packs are customizable and scalable and are optimized by our proprietary battery management system (“BMS”). We believe we produce superior battery products compared to our competitors by leveraging our technical expertise and depth of knowledge of energy storage systems into high performing products that fit a wide range of demanding applications.
At our current facility in Vernon, California, we are able to innovate, develop and manufacture battery modules and packs in high volumes. In October 2021, we secured a new 215,000 square foot facility located in Southern California to which we will transition all operations during the second and third quarters of 2022. Our new location will almost double our floorspace, providing the room for more efficient and effective expansion as we grow, while keeping substantially all of our operations, labs and personnel in one location. 
We are battery cell agnostic so we can harness the best of current battery technologies, while being flexible enough to adopt next generation battery technologies when they are ready to meet our stringent standards and customer requirements. Our founders were former leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon, Apple, Bosch and Samsung, and our highly skilled team is experienced with multiple vehicle launches and deep knowledge across all core engineering disciplines including electrical, thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrochemistry. With over 60 battery-specific engineers, we have researched, developed, and deployed energy-dense and space-saving battery pack designs, proprietary thermal management, and a smart, built-in BMS to support a wide range of customers with products featuring next-level range, performance and durability.
Our business today is primarily focused on marketing mobility energy technology for medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles in Classes 4-8. We have collaborated with Heritage Environmental Services, Inc. (“HES”), to focus on sustainability and reuse applications of our batteries, and we have a strategic alliance with Republic Services Group Inc. (“Republic”) to cooperate in opportunities to incorporate next-generation battery technology into its fleet operations. We also collaborate with Dynexus Technology (“Dynexus”) to integrate Dynexus’ battery performance and health sensors into our battery ecosystem. These relationships help us to de-risk our business model, scale our business, and deliver value to our customers.
Since 2016, we have been designing and building battery modules, and we provide enabling battery technology to key customers in the commercial electric vehicle (“EV”) industry. We are not manufacturers of vehicles directly subject to regulatory requirements applicable to vehicles; rather, our role is supplying the vehicle manufacturers with the most appropriate battery modules and battery technology for their specific vehicle designs and intended uses. The advantage we bring to the vehicle manufacturers with whom we partner is the ability to design lighter batteries with higher energy density and output, as described further below. While our customers are subject to specific regulatory requirements for vehicle safety standards, such regulations do not directly apply to us; our products are designed to integrate into vehicles required to meet these standards. Our 
business is working with vehicle manufactures to provide them with the preeminent energy storage technology that works in their vehicles.
As the era of fossil fuel powered vehicles continues to decline, our mission is to lead the way towards electrification of the global transportation industry and be the commercial EV energy provider of today and tomorrow, driving change to move people and goods efficiently with zero emissions.
Industry & Market
Total Addressable Market (“TAM”)
Our energy technology has positioned us to lead in electrification of the global commercial vehicles market. By 2031, approximately 700,000 light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty battery electric commercial vehicles are expected to be sold annually in North America alone, with steady growth expected as electrification mandates and public charging infrastructure continue to develop for commercial electric vehicles (based on ACT Research and IHS Markit Data, 2021). Battery energy demand for approximately 700,000 light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty battery electric commercial vehicles represents an estimated $82 billion TAM in North America by 2031.
Shift to Zero-Emission Vehicles
A variety of regulatory developments driven by consumer and societal pressures to reduce CO2 emissions are helping drive rapid adoption of zero-emission vehicles, thus accelerating the electrification of commercial vehicles. As a result, global EV sales are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19% from 2020-2040, while internal combustion engine (“ICE”) sales are projected to decrease by 5% over the same period (Morgan Stanley Research, 2020).
•California’s Air Resources Board proposed the world’s first zero-emission sales mandate on commercial trucks, including 40% of trucks sold to be zero-emission by 2035 and 100% by 2045.
•As of July 2021, at least 47 states and the District of Columbia offer incentives to support deployment of EVs or alternative fuel vehicles and supporting infrastructure, either through state legislation or private utility incentives within the state, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia announced a joint memorandum of understanding, committing to a goal of ensuring that 100 percent of all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales be zero-emission vehicles by 2050, with an interim target of 30 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2030. 
•The European Union Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/631, which introduced CO2 emission performance standards. Per this regulation, between 2025-2029, the fleet-wide average CO2 emissions must be 15% lower compared to 2019 levels and by 2030, they must be 30% lower compared to 2019 levels.
Logistics and OEM Commitments to EV
Similarly, the world’s largest logistics and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) have also committed to electric fleets, as electrification enables a reduction in total cost of ownership for logistics players:

Our team also conducts algorithms for life optimization of electric fleets based on field operation data. By using machine learning, we can maximize our customers’ fleet efficiency, providing our customers with a key competitive advantage over their competitors.
Business Segments
During the third quarter of 2021, we hired a new Chief Executive Officer who became our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). Our new CODM changed how we manage our business and allocate resources, which resulted in modifications to our organizational and segment structure. As a result, we reorganized from two segments (Romeo Power North America and Joint Venture Support) to a single operating segment for the consolidated business. Our operations are now comprised of a single reportable segment.
The CODM evaluates and monitors performance primarily through consolidated sales and gross profit. Asset information is not regularly reported to the CODM for purposes of the allocation of resources or assessing segment performance.

All of our revenues (based on location of customer) and long-lived assets were within North America for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Technology and Products
As the market trends toward zero-emission solutions, we believe there will be increasing demand for medium to high voltage battery packs for EVs, ranging from commercial trucks and buses to other adjacent markets such as off-highway vehicles, marine vessels, stationary storage, aviation and other personal mobility solutions. By offering premium battery technology for the growing EV and other markets, we believe we are well-positioned to supply an integral part required in zero-emission transportation products.
We design, engineer and produce energy-dense, commercially available lithium-ion battery products in a cost-effective manner, creating a safe, efficient and powerful energy solution for our customers. We offer customized solutions using proprietary in-house technology allowing for optimized electrical, mechanical, thermal and structural aspects that are designed to safely meet our customers’ energy needs.

Battery Modules
Our large battery modules uniquely balance modular and integrated design, and therefore offer flexible and customizable design as building blocks that allow for custom packs without needing months or years of additional research and development (“R&D”) for each prototype.
Banyan Module
As our standard vehicle building block suitable for battery powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Banyan is the perfect module for trucks and buses. Banyan modules have integrated active cooling and structural capability, high stability and superior thermal management, and can be configured into eight unique different voltages. The integration of multiple functions into a single component improves volumetric and gravimetric energy density, and our scalable recipe results in a faster time to market for our customers with off-the-shelf modules. The module functions as the ultimate “drop-in” solution; structure, cooling and heating, and safety functions and features are seamlessly integrated into one package.
With a 10.3kWh capacity, 215 Wh/kg energy density, and a 2-hour charge time, Banyan has the highest energy density, longest range and fastest charging time on the market, even surpassing the Tesla Model 3 in energy density at the module level and at pack level when integrated into our packs. Banyan utilizes the high energy density cylindrical 21700 cell format in a modular design with high packaging efficiency, high power capability, and an integrated thermal and structural plate. Additionally, the Banyan module uniquely achieves a single-cell fault-tolerance by design, meaning that the risk of a catastrophic thermal incident is greatly mitigated. Additionally, the modules have integrated sensors for early detection of certain anomalies, and therefore are capable of providing the vehicle with a safety alarm that significantly exceeds the requirement set by the standard known as GTR20 (Global Technical Regulation No. 20 issued by the United Nation’s Economic Commission for Europe). Banyan modules also meet SAE J2380 and J2464 standards for vibration and shock requirements.
Menara Battery Pack Family
The Menara Packs are the first ever pack family in the battery-powered EV (“BEV”) space. Our intellectual property portfolio gives us the technology to create powerful and flexible packs that can be utilized from Class 3 delivery vehicles to the world’s largest long-haul Class 8 vehicles. Our packs are highly compatible with many of our customers’ current applications. Our Menara BEV pack family features the following specifications:
•Up to 1000V working voltage
•Delivers a wide range of energy solutions (30 kWh to 1 MWh)
•Configurable in 10kWh increments
•Serviceable junction box
•Distributed BMS architecture
•Module and pack single cell fault tolerant
•Fast charge time
We believe there will be a greater need for medium to high voltage battery packs for EVs ranging from Class 8 commercial trucks and buses to adjacent markets, such as off-highway vehicles, marine vessels, stationary storage, aviation and other personal mobility solutions as these markets mature. By offering battery pack solutions for various niche products within the growing EV and truck industry, we believe that we are well-positioned to supply an integral part required in the creation of zero-emission transportation products across market segments.
Our modular battery design allows for mass production and easy application into an array of vehicles. Our batteries are designed around vehicle class requirements and, accordingly, are end-market agnostic.
Battery Management System
Our proprietary BMS is designed, tested and validated in-house. It offers a complete solution for monitoring and controlling complex battery systems for automotive applications, making it one of the most holistic systems in the market today. Our battery packs utilize a BMS that manages the modules and packs to ensure they operate at optimal performance while safely maintaining ideal operating conditions.
Our BMS can be customized to suit each customer’s specific application using our proprietary management algorithm to enable rapid charge or discharge of the battery while optimizing performance and longevity.
Our battery modules and packs are single-cell fault-tolerant. This means that in the outlying case, where for some reason a certain battery cell exhibits a thermal incident, the thermal incident will not propagate to the neighboring cells. Based on system requirements, our BMS can be programmed to shut off the system completely after a cell-related incident, or to keep operating safely in an actively derated fashion until servicing is conducted.
Non-recurring Engineering
We provide non-recurring engineering services to our customers as they look to implement a flexible solution across their entire fleets. Such services include design, prototype and testing services. 
Other Product Pipeline
Beyond the current battery modules, our R&D efforts continue to drive higher energy density, specific energy, continuous power, and safety. In addition to the current technology offered to the market, we have several products in development, which will demonstrate further advanced innovation in safety, reliability and energy density (both gravimetric and volumetric) characteristics.
Former Joint Venture with BorgWarner
In May 2019, Legacy Romeo and a subsidiary of Tier 1 automotive supplier BorgWarner formed a joint venture named BorgWarner Romeo Power LLC (the “BorgWarner JV” or “JV”) to pursue opportunities to exploit Romeo’s intellectual property outside of North America and Romeo’s core products.
On October 25, 2021, BorgWarner exercised its rights under the BorgWarner JV’s Joint Venture Operating Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) to put its ownership interest in the BorgWarner JV to Romeo. Following agreed upon steps related to the put process, Romeo acquired BorgWarner’s 60% ownership interest in the BorgWarner JV on February 4, 2022, for a purchase price of $28.6 million. Upon acquiring the additional 60% of the BorgWarner JV, Romeo dissolved the BorgWarner JV, effective February 11, 2022, and distributed all of the BorgWarner JV’s assets, including its rights to Romeo’s intellectual 
property, to Romeo. As a result, Romeo has recaptured all rights in its intellectual property that it had previously licensed to the BorgWarner JV under an Intellectual Property License Agreement (the “IP License”). Consequently, we now have the right to exploit all of our intellectual property in all fields of use and all geographic markets. Further, by dissolving the BorgWarner JV and terminating the IP License, we also assumed full, unilateral control of our R&D budget and related activities.

Certain of BorgWarner’s rights established in the JV Agreement and/or the IP License survive the dissolution of the BorgWarner JV and termination of those agreements:
•BorgWarner’s non-commercial rights in Legacy Romeo’s existing intellectual property (i.e., intellectual property that existed as of the date that Romeo purchased BorgWarner’s interest in the BorgWarner JV), as well as the right to obtain a broad commercial license to that intellectual property in the event of Legacy Romeo’s insolvency or breach of any debt covenant; and
•BorgWarner’s right of first refusal to manufacture Romeo’s stationary products (i.e., batteries that are not used in vehicles or anything else that moves) via a joint venture with Romeo on terms that Romeo and BorgWarner would negotiate at the time of forming such venture if, within three years of the date that we purchased BorgWarner’s interest in the BorgWarner JV, we propose to expand our stationary product business, including by selling stationary products outside of North America or expanding our manufacture of stationary products to an extent that causes our annual production capacity to exceed the projected 6.8 gigawatt hour capacity of our existing manufacturing facility.
Collaborative Arrangement with Heritage
We formed a collaborative arrangement with Heritage Battery Recycling, LLC (“HBR”), an affiliate of HES, to focus on sustainability and reuse applications of our battery technologies.
Pursuant to an agreement with HBR, dated October 2, 2020 (the “Heritage Agreement”), HBR has agreed to design, build and operate a system for redeploying, recycling or disposing of lithium-ion batteries (the “System”) to be located at HES’s facility in Arizona, and we have contributed $35 million to HBR to fund the building, operation, maintenance and repair of the System. Such agreement also provides that our batteries will receive first priority at the System for processing, subject to certain conditions, and we have committed to use HBR as our exclusive provider of lithium-ion battery recycling and disposal services, subject to certain exceptions.
HBR will own and operate the System. We will receive 30% of the profit generated by the System during the term of the Heritage Agreement. In the event of an operating shortfall, we would fund 30% and HBR would fund 70% of such shortfall. The Heritage Agreement does not specify when the System is to be completed or start generating revenue. The initial contract duration is for a period of ten years from December 29, 2020, and the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms indefinitely. While the arrangement is in effect, it establishes a strategic collaboration with HES for the collection of our battery packs for recycling and gives our customers priority at the recycling facility.
If HBR decides to develop any future lithium-ion battery processing facilities in North America or Europe, we would have a right of first offer to participate in any such facility under terms to be agreed upon by the parties, provided that we commit to funding at least 30% of the cost of such facility.
We have also committed to fund up to $10 million to purchase ten BEV trucks and the charging infrastructure for a one-year pilot program to determine the feasibility of transitioning HES’s or its affiliates’ fleet of trucks from diesel powered vehicles to BEVs that each utilize battery packs not smaller than 150 kWh. If such pilot program is successful, the parties would enter into an agreement for the procurement through us of at least 500 BEVs on terms acceptable to HBR, HES and us. The participants in the pilot program have been selected, and the parties have entered into agreements to support the pilot program. Development of batteries for the program is underway, and the pilot program is expected to commence in 2022.
On October 6, 2021, Heritage Battery Recycling announced it had combined with Retriev Technologies, and the combined company now operates under the Retriev Technologies brand (“Retriev”).
Other Strategic Partnerships
In January 2021, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Republic to collaborate on the development of our battery technology for use in Republic’s electric garbage trucks. Republic is the second largest provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, disposal, recycling, and environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue.
In September 2021, we announced a collaboration with Dynexus to integrate Dynexus’s actionable battery performance and health sensors into Romeo Power’s battery ecosystem. The technology developed by Dynexus will initially be utilized for incoming cell quality control and end-of-line verification, as well as module and pack diagnostics and prognostics, enabling multiple opportunities to reduce total cost of ownership for our customers.
These relationships are important in de-risking our business model, scaling the business, and delivering value to customers.
Intellectual Property and Technology
Our success depends in part on the innovations generated by our R&D group, on that group’s ability to continue to innovate effectively, and on protecting those innovations using patents, trade secrets and copyrights.
Intellectual Property
All of Legacy Romeo’s current and future intellectual property (with the exception of certain trademarks) has been assigned to Romeo Systems Technology, LLC, an intellectual property holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Romeo (“Romeo IP Holdco”). Romeo IP Holdco has granted the sole right to commercialize Legacy Romeo’s current and future intellectual property back to Legacy Romeo and has granted a non-commercial license of Legacy Romeo’s current (but not future) intellectual property to BorgWarner, as described above. See the section entitled “Business—Former Joint Venture with BorgWarner.”
Patents
We currently have three issued patents in the United States, four pending United States patent applications, with six invention disclosures based on which applications for additional patents may be prepared.
Additionally, we have three applications for patents pending in each of the European Patent Office, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and China and one Patent Cooperation Treaty application pending that is not yet in the national phase.
Trade Secrets
We protect our trade secrets and other confidential business information of any type by requiring our employees, contractors, customers and others who develop intellectual property (including confidential information) in the course of their work for us or to whom we disclose our confidential information to execute non-disclosure agreements, and we have implemented security protocols to protect our systems.
Copyrights
The software components of our BMS are protected by our copyrights from unauthorized adaptation, duplication or distribution.
Research and Development
The primary areas of focus of our R&D efforts have been thermal management for enhanced performance, longevity and safety; micro-laser welding manufacturing processes for higher throughput and more efficient use of factory floor space; BMS configurability to quickly and efficiently integrate our battery packs into customer platforms; and unique battery state monitoring and control algorithms for enhanced performance and safety.
Thermal Management
Our patent pending extruded cold plate is exceedingly thin and lightweight, yet sufficiently rigid to serve as a structural component of our battery modules. Its unique design has enabled us to increase the energy density and safety of our batteries 
and to manufacture them at lower cost. In addition, our proprietary bonding materials enhance thermal control effectiveness and electrical safety.
Our R&D teams are also working on entirely new thermal management technology for possible use in future generations of our products. Our patent pending innovations include the use of a cooling rod inside the battery cell and a vapor chamber and wick to draw heat using phase change technology. These initiatives are intended to enhance further the performance and safety of our next-generation products.
Micro-Laser Welding
Our patented micro-laser welding technology eliminates the need to extrude and solder wires. This technology greatly simplifies assembly processes, enabling us to configure our assembly lines for new products quickly and efficiently while increasing throughput and using factory floor space more efficiently. It also facilitates the efficient commercialization of product variations by shortening the development time for new system voltage configurations.
BMS
Our BMS is highly configurable, accommodating systems that are as small as 12 volts to as large as 1,000 volts. As a result, we are able to integrate our battery packs into customer platforms quickly and efficiently, without rebuilding or redesigning.
Additionally, our engineers have developed unique estimation and control algorithms that improve mileage through more accurate battery state monitoring and optimized charge and discharge cycles. They also enhance safety by early detection and remediation of hazardous conditions.
Customers and Backlog
We currently serve sixteen customers. Our existing customers include leaders in the EV sector, as well as companies committed to reducing the overall environmental impact and fuel costs of their owned and operated truck and equipment fleets. Our customers include commercial EV manufacturers, electric powertrain converters, electric watercraft manufacturers, fleet operators, and automobile and recreational vehicle manufacturers. Several of our customers have diverse vehicle offerings spanning multiple weight classes, or they operate across continental boundaries.
Our customers value safety, serviceability, and energy density. Our systems are the safest in the market as a result of the cell selection, the design of and material configuration in the module and pack, and integration with our BMS. We have achieved single cell or multiple cell fault tolerance, which means during an incident, when a cell or multiple cells go into a thermal runaway, the propagation is contained. Our modules have integrated sensors for early detection of any anomalies, and therefore are capable of signaling a safety warning to the vehicle that we believe affords the driver more time to exit the vehicle when compared to any other battery system currently available for commercial vehicles of which we are aware. We also believe we have the highest energy density in the market today, and, due to our BMS software and modular design specifications, we are able to limit service for our packs to a specific module replacement instead of full pack replacement. In addition, by design, our electronics and junction box are serviceable and easy to access.
We also have the capabilities to tailor our modular products to our customers’ applications. An example of one application-specific important feature is the ability to recover energy during braking for trucks. The combination of cell selection, together with our thermal management interface, allows us to recover energy from maximum load braking for 10 continuous minutes which represents the scenario of a truck traveling downhill for an extended period of time.
Target Customers
Our business today primarily targets large truck and bus fleet customers with established sustainability goals, as well as fleets operating along dedicated routes located in regions offering strong incentives for delivering zero-emission vehicles. 
Key Customers
Our key customers include the following:
Nikola Motor Company
Nikola Motor Company (NASDAQ: NKLA) (“Nikola”) is a leading hybrid commercial truck manufacturer based in Phoenix, Arizona. We currently have a supply agreement dated August 28, 2020, to provide battery modules and packs, both custom and off-the-shelf, for Nikola’s electric trucks. The existing agreement requires us to develop a custom battery pack design using our off-the-shelf modules and battery management system. It also requires us to manufacture battery packs based on such custom design with the support of BorgWarner. The term of the existing agreement runs until three years after we complete such design and commence commercial production of the custom battery packs.
Beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2021, we began a series of discussions with Nikola regarding our terms of business, which we currently expect to result in amendments to the terms and conditions of our existing agreement. These discussions have not yet been concluded and the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain. However, we expect that arrangements with respect to procurement of battery cells for products we manufacture and sell to Nikola will be reflected in any amendments to our existing agreement with Nikola. As a result of Nikola receiving a supply commitment from a tier-one battery cell manufacturer, we expect that Nikola will directly procure and then consign cells to us for the manufacture of battery modules we sell to them. If and when adopted, this new arrangement will remove the value of battery cells, which are the most significant portion of the product bill-of-material, from both product revenues and cost of product revenues with respect to our business with Nikola. The outcome of other aspects of our discussions with Nikola cannot be predicted at this time.

Under terms of the existing agreement, Nikola is committed to purchase approximately $243.0 million of battery modules and packs (including the value of battery cells), subject to our compliance with customary quality and delivery requirements. The agreement does not specify financial penalties or minimum payment amounts if Nikola fails to satisfy its purchase commitment. If Nikola were to breach its minimum purchase commitment (for reasons other than our serious quality control deficiencies or failure to perform our obligations under the agreement), then we would be entitled to seek customary remedies for breach of contract, subject to an agreed limitation on damages of amounts paid or payable under the agreement in the 12 months before such breach occurs.

Lightning Systems, Inc. (“Lightning”) designs and manufactures zero-emission all-electric powertrains for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, including delivery trucks, shuttle buses, passenger vans, chassis-cab models, and city transit buses. We have a supply agreement dated July 13, 2020, to supply off-the-shelf battery modules and packs across Lightning’s EV portfolio. The initial term of the agreement runs through December 31, 2024, with automatic one-year renewals unless either party decides not to renew. Lightning is committed to purchase approximately $56.0 million of battery modules and packs during the initial term, subject to our successful conclusion of customary tests of our products. If Lightning’s orders fall short of its commitment, it would be required to pay a make-whole payment based on the amount of its shortfall.
Lion Buses Inc.
Lion Buses Inc. (“Lion”) is a leading battery electric bus and truck manufacturer based in Saint-Jérôme, Canada. On November 2, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lion to supply it battery modules and packs, with a minimum purchase commitment of approximately $234.0 million of battery modules and packs during the five-year initial term of the agreement. We committed to using our best commercial efforts to have our fleet manager partners purchase Lion vehicles.
Customer Concentration 
Historically, we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, BorgWarner JV engineering services revenue accounted for 12% of our total revenue, and Nikola and Lightning accounted for approximately 62% and 12% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, BorgWarner JV engineering services revenue accounted for 35% of our total revenue, and Nikola and Hexagon Purus AS accounted for approximately 28% and 27% of our total revenue, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to contribute a significant portion of our sales in the near future although over time we expect greater customer diversification. Our ability to maintain close relationships with these top customers may have a material impact on the growth and profitability of our business.
Customer Backlog 
We define contracted revenue (or “backlog”) as the minimum amount of committed revenue expected to be received under our existing customer contracts from sales of battery packs, modules, battery management system software and services not yet built and delivered or provided.

Beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2021, and as described previously, we began a series of discussions with Nikola regarding our terms of business, which we currently expect to result in a formal change to terms and conditions of our existing agreement. These discussions have not yet been concluded and our current view of the outcome is subject to further change. However, we expect that arrangements with respect to procurement of battery cells for products we manufacture and sell to Nikola will change. As a result of Nikola receiving a supply commitment from a tier-one battery cell manufacturer, we expect that Nikola will directly procure and then consign cells to us for the manufacture of battery modules we sell to them. This new arrangement will remove the value of battery cells, which are the most significant portion of the product bill-of-material, from both product revenues and cost of product revenues once this change occurs.

Although the outcome of all aspects of our discussions with Nikola cannot be predicted at this time, we are adjusting our backlog to reflect the estimated impact of the structural change in battery cell procurement arrangement for Nikola. The updated customer backlog at December 31, 2021 is estimated to be $392.2 million, which reflects an estimated $146.9 million reduction related to the change in Nikola battery cell procurement. For $306.0 million out of the $392.2 million of backlog related to minimum quantity purchase commitments, if the customers do not follow through on their minimum purchase commitments, we would receive a maximum of $286.5 million under certain make-whole provisions included in these contracts. For the remaining $86.2 million of backlog related to minimum quantity purchase commitments included in these contracts, if the customers do not follow through on their minimum purchase commitments, we would seek damages through customary remedies for breach of contract. The portion of our backlog as of December 31, 2021 that is expected to be recognized in the twelve-month period following December 31, 2021 is approximately $35.2 million. The remaining backlog balance of approximately $357.0 million is expected to be recognized between 2023 and 2025. The difference between our backlog and our minimum revenue that would be received in satisfaction of take or pay minimum order commitments reflects that our backlog does not represent a guarantee that our customers will complete purchases of our products and services in the quantities that we anticipate, and some of our contracts allow our customers to purchase in smaller quantities with certain minimum order penalties. All contracted revenue amounts also assume continued performance of our contractual obligations and satisfaction of customary testing and quality required under each customer contract.
Competition
The energy technology and energy storage industry is highly competitive, and new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances, and shifting customer demands are causing the industry to evolve towards zero-emission solutions. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market include, but are not limited to:
•total cost of ownership (“TCO”);
•safety, reliability and quality;
•gravimetric and volumetric energy density;
•product performance and uptime;
•charging characteristics;
•technological innovation;
•comprehensive solution from a single provider;
•ease of integration; and
•service options.
Similar to traditional OEMs in the passenger vehicle market, incumbent commercial transportation OEMs are burdened with legacy systems and the need to generate sufficient return on existing infrastructure, which has resulted in a slower pace to 
adopt new zero-emission drivetrain technology until recently. This slow curve, particularly in long-haul, heavy duty commercial transportation has created the opportunity for us to mature technology for this challenging market ahead of our competition. Romeo batteries have now accumulated more than one million miles on the road, which demonstrates the durability and performance profile required by customers in this industry who are now beginning to accelerate their electrification plans for the next decade. We believe the global push for lower emissions combined with vast technological improvements in fuel cell and battery-electric powertrain technologies have encouraged well-established vehicle manufacturers to begin investing in zero-emission vehicle platforms.
Our key competitors include battery pack producers like Proterra, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL), AKASOL AG and Kreisel Electric. Some of our customers have and may continue to pursue a sourcing strategy that involves purchasing battery products from more than one battery provider. The strong vertical position of cell suppliers like CATL reinforces the value of our cell agnostic strategy. We believe that we are positioned to compete favorably in the market for EV battery packs. Although we do not have the same name recognition or operating histories as many of our competitors, we are free from the burden of legacy infrastructure, technological approach and product design. In a relatively nascent market where technology advances can create significant competitive advantage, we believe our fresh approach as a relatively young company is reflected in technology and product advantages .
Our competitive advantages include the highest energy density, longest range, and fastest charge time. Our battery packs have high stability and superior thermal management. Our high volume of U.S.-based manufacturing, and competitive TCO of our product are also key differentiators in the market.
Superior safety performance of our products is a significant strategic and competitive advantage. The safety methodology and characteristics of our products are verified both internally, and by independent external entities like Underwriters Laboratories. Further, our design capabilities, advanced proprietary technology, and the manufacturing advantage of our modular and scalable products allows us to supply customers with exactly what they need.
Suppliers
Our products use parts that are sourced from suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with vendors of key components of our battery products, in particular battery cells. We also work closely with suppliers to develop novel materials or configurations for specifically desired functionality within our system design. Certain components purchased from suppliers are common across our product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.
The price we pay for battery cells depends on a number of factors, including material grades of chemistry selected for cell recipe, volumes, long-term commitment, logistics and shipping, and tariffs. The cost of battery cells also depends on the industry supply and demand balance, as well as the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. Costs for these raw materials have increased due to higher production costs and demand surges in the EV market which may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through our products or services. 
Faced with a global shortage of battery cells, suppliers are increasing their output capacity in Asia and in the United States while EV battery pack manufacturers are competing for a severely limited supply of battery cells in the short and medium term. See the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Current Market Conditions” for additional information.

Manufacturing and Production 
 Our current manufacturing facility in Vernon, California can produce battery packs and modules quickly and reliably to meet our customers’ volume requirements. Our trained employees are veterans of renowned technology companies from California and automotive OEMs, and they are passionate about producing industry-leading battery modules and packs. Before leaving our facility, all modules and packs are tested according to stringent industry standards. 
In October 2021, we secured a new 215,000 square foot facility located in Southern California to which we will transition all operations during the second and third quarters of 2022. Our new location will almost double our floorspace, providing the room for more efficient and effective expansion as we grow, while keeping substantially all of our operations, labs and personnel in one location. Our current Vernon facility and the new facility are both located close to port and intermodal transport networks for quick delivery.
Our designs are optimized and inherently flexible for high-rate manufacturing on the same production lines. Our trained technicians provide drop-in solutions for our customers’ vehicles by assembling our modules into custom high-capacity battery pack configurations. 
Automation of critical assembly steps coupled with patented component designs makes our module production process economical, reliable, and able to meet aggressive production timelines. Our state-of-the-art laser welder combines vision-based guidance and precision fixturing to pinpoint an exact weld location on each battery cell. The welds connecting the cells are made at light speed, creating a repeatable, reliable, and vibration-resistant interconnection.
We have constructed a robust product test plan strategy to characterize module and pack performance, product life, construction integrity and design improvements. Our proprietary test plans, developed from past experience in automotive, aerospace, space and consumer electronics industries, specifically for battery applications and systems set us apart. We have a state-of-the-art in-house test lab offering comprehensive testing services for the entire product development lifecycle.
Our full range of test capabilities includes:
•mechanical, environmental, electrical and safety testing;
•engineering, qualification, and production testing for single cell, module and pack level battery systems;

•comprehensive failure analysis (“FA”) solutions including: cross section imaging, cell tear downs and FA reports; and
•test consulting and documentation services including: test plan development, test procedure development, test fixture design, and automated test equipment development.
No module or pack is considered complete until its functional and electrical characteristics are verified. Our state-of-the-art testing systems verify all critical specifications to assure everything is fully functional as intended and ready to plug into an EV.
Designing safe, reliable and robust systems with in-depth battery research means ensuring our customers’ standards are met at every step throughout the entire product maturity, development, and production process. As packs come off the production line, failure analysis includes:
•crush/impact;
•penetration;
•short circuit;
•cell spacing; and
•cell-to-cell and module-to-module passive propagation resistance.
Sales and Marketing
We have the technology, manufacturing knowledge and determination to maximize our market share in the United States, Mexico and Canada as an immediate focus, followed by other global markets as we begin to pursue customers previously within the scope of the BorgWarner JV. We take an insight-driven, strategic approach to our go-to-market strategy. Sales activities are generally carried out by our full-time sales employees. The sales process for our products is long and complex, often involving technical collaboration, sampling and validation. We believe that our relationships with existing customers are generally strong, both with the incumbents and new entrants in the commercial vehicle market. As our customers’ product pipeline expands, these entities will continue to be a source of organic growth. 
We launched a corporate rebranding in 2021 to align our marketing materials to the core of our company identity, which is a deep commitment to innovation for a more sustainable future enhanced by reduction of carbon emissions. Our bold new look embodies our lasting promise: to serve the most demanding and innovative customers by providing the world’s highest energy density batteries that deliver superior performance, safety, flexibility and durability.

Government Regulation
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
Facility Operations
We currently operate from a single, dedicated EV battery pack manufacturing facility located in Vernon, California. Our operations at our Vernon, California facility are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials. As announced in October 2021, we secured a new 215,000 square foot facility located in Cypress, California to which we will transition all operations during the second and third quarters of 2022. At the new facility, we will be subject to the same environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials.
To conduct our operations, we have to obtain environmental, health, and safety permits and registrations and prepare plans. We are subject to inspections and possible citations by federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety regulators. In transit, lithium-ion batteries are subject to rules governing the transportation of “dangerous goods.” We have policies and programs in place to assure compliance with our obligations (for example, machine guarding, hot work, hazardous material management and transportation). We train our employees and conduct audits of our operations to assess our fulfillment of these policies.
We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances. Under the law, we can be liable even if we did not cause a release on real property that we lease. We believe we have taken commercially reasonable steps to avoid such liability with respect to our leased facility located in the city of Vernon, California, which is well known for its long industrial history. As with many sites in Vernon, there is onsite contamination below our facility in the form of soil vapors. However, there is currently no requirement to investigate or remediate this onsite contamination. Since we began operations at the Vernon facility in 2017, we have no reason to believe that our operations contributed to the contamination or otherwise caused any onsite releases. Liability to address these historical conditions rests primarily with the landlord of the Vernon facility and companies that originally released contaminants causing the soil vapors. However, as noted above, we could be held liable in certain limited circumstances as the lessee and operator of the Vernon facility. Ultimately, we do not believe that these soil vapor conditions represent a material risk. Once we begin operations in the new facility in Cypress, California, we will be subject to similar risks and potential liabilities resulting from our operations.
Product Stewardship
We recognize that large-scale global adoption of lithium-ion batteries will require cost-effective recycling processes. Accordingly, we have a product stewardship program that addresses both ease of disassembly of our battery packs and collection of battery packs and modules removed from active service for proper handling and disposal. Balancing necessary 
ease of battery disassembly with safety and durability requirements, our battery packs’ layered design and low content of adhesives make separation processes less complex and recycling more cost effective. Romeo battery packs can have a “second life” as refurbished batteries or for use in stationary storage application for which reduced performance capability is acceptable.
We have also formed a collaborative arrangement with HBR, an affiliate of HES, for the collection of our battery packs for recycling. HES has a long history of recycling all types of batteries. See the section entitled “Business—Collaborative Arrangement with Heritage.” On October 6, 2021, Heritage Battery Recycling announced it had combined with Retriev Technologies, and the combined company now operates under the Retriev Technologies brand (“Retriev”).
Buy America
The U.S. “Buy America” requirements impose price differentials or prohibitions on procurement of products purchased under certain U.S. government programs. The price differentials or prohibitions apply to products that are not produced in the U.S. or that do not contain U.S. components making up at least 50% of the total cost of all components in the product. Our battery packs are designed and manufactured in the U.S. and qualify as “domestic origin” for purposes of “Buy America” requirements, which offers us an advantage to supply to customers who are subject to such requirements.
