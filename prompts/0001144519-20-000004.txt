Business Overview
We are a leading global agribusiness and food company with integrated operations that stretch from the farm to consumer foods. We believe we are a leading:

• | global oilseed processor and producer of vegetable oils and protein meals, based on processing capacity;


• | global grain processor, based on volume;


• | seller of packaged vegetable oils worldwide, based on sales;


• | producer and seller of wheat flours, bakery mixes and dry milled corn products in North and South America, based on volume; and


• | producer of sugar and ethanol in Brazil, through our interest in the recently-formed BP Bunge Bioenergia joint

venture.
In May 2019, we announced a new, global operating model, aligned with our commercial activities of handling and processing agricultural commodities and commodity products, managing physical product flows, and risk management and optimization, thus representing a shift away from our previous regional approach. The new operating model will increase our strategic flexibility and customer focus. Additionally, in 2019 we substantially completed our Global Competitiveness Program, launched in 2017 to improve our cost position and deliver increased value to shareholders.
As of December 31, 2019, we continue to conduct our operations in five reportable segments: Agribusiness, Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy, and Fertilizer. However, in conjunction with the aforementioned announcement, these reportable segments may change upon the further evolution of our new global operating model and related reporting structure. We refer to the Edible Oil Products and Milling Products segments collectively as our Food and Ingredients businesses. Key elements of our corporate strategy include enhancing our global expertise and footprint in grains and oilseeds through targeted, capital-efficient investments and strategic partnerships, by working with customers to develop products, services and solutions that meet current and future needs in food and feed applications, and through a strong focus on cost efficiency and continuous improvement. Our strategy is aligned with long-term global macroeconomic and consumer growth trends, including a commitment to sustainability.
Our Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business principally involved in the purchase, storage, transportation, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Our Agribusiness operations and assets are located in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, and we have merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.
Our Food and Ingredients businesses consist of two reportable business segments: Edible Oil Products and Milling Products. The Edible Oil Products segment includes businesses that sell vegetable oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise and specialty ingredients. In December 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets to Seara Alimentos S.A. The Milling Products segment includes businesses that sell wheat flours, bakery mixes, corn-based products and rice. The operations and assets of our Edible Oil Products segment are primarily located in North and South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the operations and assets of our Milling Products segment are located in North and South America.
In December 2019, we contributed our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations into a joint venture with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP p.l.c. ("BP"). These operations formed the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment through which we produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process. The joint venture, BP Bunge Bioenergia, in which we have a 50% interest, operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North and Midwest regions of Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia is now the second largest operator by effective crushing capacity in the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol biofuel industry. As a result of this transaction, we no longer consolidate our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in our consolidated financial statements. We account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
Our Fertilizer segment is involved in producing, blending and distributing fertilizer products for the agricultural industry in South America, with operations and retail distribution activities in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and port facilities in Argentina and Brazil.

Agribusiness
Overview—Our Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing and selling agricultural commodities and commodity products while managing risk across various product lines. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle in this segment are oilseeds, primarily soybeans, rapeseed, canola and sunflower seed, and grains, primarily wheat and corn. We process oilseeds into vegetable oils and protein meals, principally for the food, animal feed and biodiesel industries, through a global network of facilities. Our footprint is well balanced, with approximately 33% of our processing capacity located in South America, 27% in North America, 26% in Europe and 14% in Asia-Pacific.
Customers—We sell agricultural commodities and processed commodity products to customers throughout the world. The principal purchasers of our oilseeds, grains and oilseed meal are animal feed manufacturers, livestock producers, wheat and corn millers and other oilseed processors. As a result, our agribusiness operations generally benefit from global demand for protein, primarily poultry and pork products. The principal purchasers of the unrefined vegetable oils produced in this segment are our own Food and Ingredients businesses and third-party edible oil processing companies, which use these oils as raw materials in the production of edible oil products for the food service, food processor and retail markets. In addition, we sell oil products for various non-food uses, including industrial applications and the production of biodiesel.
Distribution and Logistics—We have developed an extensive global logistics network to transport our products, including trucks, railcars, river barges and ocean freight vessels. Typically, we either lease the transportation assets or contract with third parties for these services. To better serve our customer base and develop our global distribution and logistics capabilities, we own or operate either directly or through joint venture arrangements, various port terminal facilities, including in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Vietnam and Australia.
Financial Services and Activities—We also offer various financial services, principally trade structured finance and financial risk management services, to customers and other third parties. Our trade structured finance operations leverage our international trade flows to generate trade finance derived liquidity in emerging markets for third parties. Our financial risk management services include structuring and marketing risk management products to enable agricultural producers and end users of commodities to manage commodity price risk exposures. We also engage in foreign exchange and other financial instrument trading via our financial services business. Additionally, we provide financing services to farmers, primarily in Brazil, from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities. Our farmer financing activities are an integral part of our grain and oilseed origination activities as they help assure the annual supply of raw materials for our Brazilian agribusiness operations.
Biodiesel—We own and operate biodiesel facilities in Europe and Brazil and have equity method investments in biodiesel producers in Europe and Argentina. This business is complementary to our core Agribusiness operations as in each case we supply some of the raw materials (refined or partially refined vegetable oil) used in their production processes.
Raw Materials—We purchase oilseeds and grains either directly from farmers or indirectly through intermediaries. Although the availability and price of agricultural commodities may, in any given year, be affected by unpredictable factors such as weather, government programs and policies and farmer planting and selling decisions, our operations in major crop growing regions have enabled us to source adequate raw materials for our operational needs.
Competition—Due to their commodity nature, markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to product substitution. Competition is principally based on price, quality, product and service offerings, and geographic location. Major competitors include but are not limited to: The Archer Daniels Midland Co. ("ADM"), Cargill Incorporated ("Cargill"), Louis Dreyfus Group ("Louis Dreyfus"), Glencore International PLC, Wilmar International Limited ("Wilmar") and COFCO International ("COFCO").
Food and Ingredients
Overview—Our Food and Ingredients businesses include two reportable business segments: Edible Oil Products and Milling Products. We primarily sell our products to three customer types or market channels: food processors, food service 
companies, and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our Food and Ingredients businesses are various crude and further processed vegetable oils and fats in our Edible Oil Products segment, as well as wheat, corn and rice in our Milling Products segment. These raw materials are mostly agricultural commodities that we either produce or purchase from third parties. We believe that our global integrated business model enables us to realize synergies between our Agribusiness and Food and Ingredients operations through raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Food and Ingredients businesses are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from macro population and income growth rates. Additionally, our Food and Ingredients businesses are focused on capitalizing on growing global consumer food trends, including a desire for less processed, healthier foods, interest in new flavors, and increases in snacking and eating outside the home.
Edible Oil Products
Products—Our edible oil products include packaged and bulk oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. We primarily use soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and canola oil that we produce in our Agribusiness segment oilseed processing operations as raw materials in this business. We also refine and fractionate palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter, and blend and refine olive oil. Additionally, we produce specialty ingredients derived from vegetable oils, such as lecithin, which is used as an emulsifier in a broad range of food products. We are a leading seller of packaged vegetable oils worldwide, based on sales. We have edible oil refining and packaging facilities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Our edible oil products business is largely business to business ("B2B") focused in North America, while in South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific it comprises a mix of B2B and business to consumer ("B2C") offerings.
In Brazil, our retail edible oil brands include Soya, the leading consumer packaged vegetable oil brand, as well as Primor and Salada. We are also a leading supplier of shortenings to the food processor market. We also produce processed tomato and other staple food products, including sauces, condiments and seasonings under several brand names. In December 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our Brazilian margarine and mayonnaise assets to Seara Alimentos S.A.
In the United States and Canada, we offer food manufacturers, bakeries, confectionary, and food service operators high-quality solutions to fit their goals, such as delivering desired tastes and textures, or reducing trans-fats or saturated fats in their products. Our products include trans-fat free high-oleic canola oil, which is low in saturated fats, and high-oleic soybean oil, which is highly stable and trans-fat free. We have also developed proprietary fiber addition processes that allow bakery and food processor customers to achieve significant saturated fat reductions in shortenings. We also offer expeller-pressed and physically-refined oils to food service customers under the Whole Harvest brand, and produce margarines and buttery spreads, including our leading Country Premium brand, for food service, food processor and retail private label customers. 
In Europe, we are a leader in consumer packaged vegetable oils, which are sold in various geographies under brand names including Venusz, Floriol, Kujawski, Olek, Unisol, Ideal, Oleina, Maslenitsa, Oliwier, Salat Rozumnitsa and Komili. We are also a leader in margarines, under brand names including Smakowita, Maslo Rosline, Masmix, Optima, Deli Reform, Keiju, Evesol, Linco, Gottgott, Suvela and Finuu. Additionally, we produce a variety of products for the confectionary and bakery industries. We are also a significant B2B oils supplier in the Western European food service channel.
In Asia, we offer a range of consumer and B2B products, including bakery, culinary, confectionary and infant nutrition products. In India, our consumer brands include Dalda, Ginni and Chambal edible oils; Dalda and Gagan vanaspatis; and Masterline professional bakery fats. In China, we offer consumer edible oils products under the Dou Wei Jia brand. 
Customers—Our customers include baked goods companies, snack food producers, confectioners, restaurant chains, food service operators, infant nutrition companies, and other food manufacturers who use vegetable oils and shortenings as ingredients in their operations. Other customers include grocery chains, wholesalers, distributors, and other retailers who sell to consumers either under our own brand names or private labels. These customers include global and national food processors and manufacturers, many of which are leading brand owners in their product categories.
Competition—Competition is based on a number of factors, including price, raw material procurement, distribution capability, cost structure, brand recognition, product quality, innovation, technical support, product innovation, composition and nutritional value, and advertising and promotion. Our products may compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label and customized products. Our principal competitors in the Edible Oil Products segment include, but are not limited to: ADM, AAK AB, Cargill, Fuji Oil Co. Ltd. and Wilmar, as well as local competitors in each region.
Milling Products
Products—Our Milling Products segment activities include the production and sale of a variety of wheat flours and bakery mixes in Brazil and Mexico, corn-based products, derived from both the dry and wet corn milling processes, in the United States and Mexico, and milled rice products in the United States and Brazil.
Our brands in Brazil include Suprema, Soberana, Primor and Predileta wheat flours, and Gradina and Pre-Mescla bakery premixes. Our wheat flour and bakery mix brands in Mexico include Espiga, Esponja, Francesera, Chulita, Galletera and Pastelera. Our corn milling products primarily consist of dry-milled corn meals and flours, wet-milled masa and flours, flaking and brewer's grits, as well as soy-fortified corn meal, corn-soy blend, and other similar products. As part of our corn portfolio, we also sell whole grain and fiber ingredients. In the United States, we offer ancient grains, such as quinoa and millet, in our portfolio.

Our major competitors in our U.S. rice milling business include ADM and Farmers' Rice Cooperative. 
Sugar and Bioenergy
Prior to the formation of the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture in December 2019, our sugar and bioenergy business consisted of eight sugarcane mills in Brazil. In our former sugar and bioenergy business, we used sugarcane to produce sugar and ethanol, which was supplied by a combination of our own plantations and third-party farmers. Additionally, through cogeneration facilities at our sugarcane mills, we produced electricity from the burning of sugarcane bagasse (the fibrous portion of the sugarcane that remains after the extraction of sugarcane juice) in boilers, which enabled our mills to meet their energy requirements. Any surplus electricity was sold to the local grid or other large third-party users of electricity. All of these activities were assumed by our BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture. As a result of this transaction, we account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting and no longer consolidate our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in our consolidated financial statements.
In connection with the formation of the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture, we combined our eight mills, the plantations we owned and managed, and related assets, together with BP’s sugar and bioenergy business in Brazil, which included three mills and related assets. The mills of the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture are supplied with sugarcane grown on approximately 313,000 hectares of land. In 2019, approximately 70% of our total milled sugarcane came from our owned or managed plantations and 30% was purchased from third-party suppliers. These mills allow the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity, as further described below.

• | Sugar-The BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture produces two types of sugar: very high polarity ("VHP") raw sugar and crystal sugar. VHP sugar is similar to the raw sugar traded on major commodities exchanges, including the standard NY11 contract, and is sold almost exclusively for export. Crystal sugar is a non-refined white sugar and is principally sold domestically in Brazil.


• | Ethanol-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces and sells two types of ethanol: hydrous and anhydrous. Hydrous ethanol is consumed directly as a transport fuel, while anhydrous ethanol is blended with gasoline in transport fuels.


• | Electricity-BP Bunge Bioenergia generates electricity from burning sugarcane bagasse in our mills.

We expect that the sugar produced at BP Bunge Bioenergia’s mills will be sold in both the Brazilian domestic market, primarily in the confectionary and food processing industries, and export markets. The ethanol is expected to be sold primarily to customers for use in the Brazilian domestic market to meet the demand for fuel, with sugar and ethanol also exported in the international market. BP Bunge Bioenergia competes with other sugar and ethanol producers both in Brazil and internationally, and with beet sugar processors, along with producers of other sweeteners and biofuels in the global market. Major competitors in Brazil include Cosan Limited/Raizen, São Martinho S.A. and Biosev (Louis Dreyfus). Major international competitors include British Sugar PLC, Südzucker AG, Cargill, Tereos S.A., Sucden S.A., ED&F Man Limited and COFCO.
Fertilizer
Overview—Through our operations in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, we produce, blend and distribute a range of liquid and dry NPK fertilizers, including nitrogen-based liquid and solid phosphate fertilizers. NPK refers to nitrogen (N), phosphate (P) and potassium (K), the main components of chemical fertilizers, used for the production of crops, including soybeans, corn and wheat. Our operations in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay are closely linked to our grain origination activities, as we supply fertilizer to producers that supply us with grain. In Brazil, we operate a terminal in the Port of Santos that discharges and handles imported fertilizers and provides logistics and support services. Our Brazilian grain operations also supply farmers, through barter agreements, with third-party produced fertilizer.
Products and Services—We offer a complete fertilizer portfolio, including SSP, ammonia, and ammonium thiosulfate that we produce, as well as monoammonium phosphate, diammonium phosphate, triple supersphosphate, urea, urea-ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and potassium chloride that we purchase from third parties and resell. We primarily market our products under the Bunge brand, with liquid fertilizers marketed under the Solmix brand.
Raw Materials—Our main raw materials in this segment are concentrated phosphate rock, sulfuric acid, natural gas and sulfur. The prices of fertilizer raw materials are typically based on international prices that reflect global supply and demand factors, as well as global transportation and other logistics costs. Each of these fertilizer raw materials is readily available in the international market from multiple sources.
Competition—Competition is based on a number of factors, including delivered price, product offering and quality, location, access to raw materials, production efficiency and customer service, sometimes including customer financing terms. Our main competitors in our fertilizer operations in Argentina are Nutrien Ltd. (Agrium/ASP), YPF S.A., Profertil S.A., COFCO (Nidera B.V.), Yara International ASA and Louis Dreyfus.
Risk Management
Risk management is a fundamental aspect of our business. Engaging in the hedging of risk exposures and anticipating market developments are critical to protecting and enhancing our return on assets. As such, we are active in derivative markets for agricultural commodities, energy, ocean freight, foreign currency, and interest rates. We seek to leverage the market insights that we gain through our global operations across our businesses by actively managing our physical and financial positions on a daily basis. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Insurance
In each country in which we conduct business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that we deem appropriate for a company of our size and activities, based on an analysis of the relative risks and costs. We believe that our geographic dispersion of assets helps mitigate the risk to our business from an adverse event affecting a specific facility. However, if we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not insured in full or in part, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
We have included financial information about our reportable segments and our operations by geographic area in Note 28 - Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development, Innovation, Patents and Licenses
Our research and development activities are focused on developing products and improving processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations. In our Food and Ingredients business, we have 17 research and development centers globally to support product development and enhancement. Additionally, Bunge Ventures, our corporate venture capital unit, invests in start-ups and other early stage companies that are developing new technologies relevant to our industries.
We own trademarks, patents and licenses covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes. However, neither our business as a whole nor any segment is dependent on any specific trademark, patent or license. 
Seasonality
In our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year, since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres, and we sell and distribute products throughout the year. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in 
terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, and the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. Our North and South American grain merchandising and oilseed processing activities are, therefore, generally at lower levels during the first quarter.
In our Food and Ingredients businesses, demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays and other annual events.
In our Fertilizer segment, we are subject to seasonal trends based on the South American agricultural growing cycle as farmers typically purchase the bulk of their fertilizer needs in the second half of the year.
Government Regulation
In each of the countries in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business, including general business regulations as well as those governing the manufacturing, handling, storage, transport, marketing and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, and limitations on water use. Additionally, from time-to-time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions, and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to ensure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets.
Many countries use and produce biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Biofuels convert crops, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, palm, rapeseed or canola, and other oilseeds, into ethanol or biodiesel to extend, enhance or substitute for fossil fuels. Production of biofuels has increased significantly in the last decade in response to both periods of high fossil fuel prices and to government incentives to produce biofuels offered in many countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina and several South East Asian and European countries. Furthermore, in several countries, governmental authorities are mandating biofuels use in transport fuels at specified levels. As such, the markets for agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels have become increasingly affected by the growth of the biofuels industry and related legislation.
Environmental Matters and Sustainability
We incorporate sustainability into many areas of our business, from how we plan and develop our strategic goals and operate our facilities to how we engage with our customers, suppliers, employees, communities and other stakeholders. Our philosophy is to "Act, Conserve and Engage" and our efforts include policies and initiatives to reduce deforestation, conserve natural resources in our operations and engage across our sector to address the sustainability challenges in the agribusiness and food value chain. We periodically communicate our progress through various disclosure platforms, including annual sustainability reports and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDPs), among others.
We are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and we incur costs to comply with these requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental matters has not had a material financial or competitive effect on our business. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under these laws and regulations. Violation can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities.
Additionally, our business could be affected in the future by the regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions or policies related to national emission reduction plans. We regularly assess the potential impacts to our business resulting from regulation or policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and we may be required to make additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes. As a result, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Physical effects of climate change, including shifts in agricultural production areas and climatic volatility, could in the long-term result in incidents of stranded physical assets. We believe the breadth and diversification of our global asset network, as well as our participation in the global trade of agricultural commodities, help to mitigate these risks.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately 24,000 employees and 31,000 employees, respectively. The decrease in the number of employees is primarily related to the formation of the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture in December 2019, to which we contributed our Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations. Many of our employees are represented by labor unions, and their employment is governed by collective bargaining agreements. In general, we consider our employee relations to be good.

Bunge's edible oil products operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa.
Milling products—Bunge's Milling Products segment includes wheat, corn and rice milling businesses, which purchase wheat, corn and rice directly from farmers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers and other customers. Bunge's wheat milling activities are primarily in Mexico and Brazil. Corn and rice milling activities are in the United States and Mexico.
Sugar and Bioenergy—In December 2019, Bunge contributed its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations, forming the majority of its Sugar and Bioenergy segment, through which it produced and sold sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane, as well as energy derived from the sugar and ethanol production process, into a joint venture with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP p.l.c. ("BP"). The joint venture, BP Bunge Bioenergia, in which Bunge has a 50% interest, operates on a stand-alone basis, with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North and Midwest regions of Brazil. As a result of this transaction, Bunge no longer consolidates its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations in its consolidated financial statements, and accounts for its interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
Fertilizer—Bunge's Fertilizer segment operates in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, where it produces, blends and distributes a range of liquid and dry NPK fertilizers, including nitrogen-based liquid and solid phosphate fertilizers. Bunge's operations in Argentina are closely linked to its grain origination activities as it supplies fertilizer to producers who supply the Company with grain. This segment also includes port operations in Brazil.
Basis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years, except as described in these notes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.
Discontinued Operations—In determining whether a disposal group should be presented as discontinued operations, Bunge makes a determination of whether such a group being disposed of comprises a component of the entity, or a group of components of the entity, that represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. If these determinations are made affirmatively, the results of operations of the group being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from the continuing operations of the Company for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bunge, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary, and as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all entities over which Bunge exercises control. Equity investments in which Bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Investments in which Bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, or fair value if that is readily determinable. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a 
F-9

controlling financial interest, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's business and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's operations. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. The VIE and consolidation assessments are revisited upon the occurrence of relevant reconsideration events.
Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to Bunge's ownership interests of less than 100% are reported as Noncontrolling interests or Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership interests in Bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.
Reclassifications—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Use of Estimates—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Bunge to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements—Bunge's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of Bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency and, as such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then such foreign entity's financial statements shall be remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.
Bunge has significant operations in Argentina and, up until June 30, 2018, had utilized the official exchange rate of the Argentine peso published by the Argentine government for its commercial transactions and remeasurement purposes of financial statements. Argentina has experienced negative economic trends, as evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates, requiring the Argentine government to take mitigating actions. During the second quarter of 2018, it was determined that Argentina's economy should be considered highly inflationary, and as such, beginning on July 1, 2018, Bunge's Argentine subsidiaries changed their functional currency to the U.S. Dollar. This change in functional currency did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements. 
Foreign Currency Transactions—Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in Bunge's consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gain (loss) unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future. Gains or losses arising from translation of such transactions are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash—Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheet that sums to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

 | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 320 | | $ | 389 | $ | 601
Restricted cash included in other current assets | 2 | | 4 | | 4 
Total | $ | 322 | | $ | 393 | $ | 605

Trade Accounts Receivable and Secured Advances to Suppliers—Trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at their historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Bunge establishes an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions as well as specific customer collection issues. Uncollectible 
F-10

accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when Bunge has determined that collection is unlikely.
Secured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates which reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.
Bunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes.
Under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if Bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the borrower defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
Inventories—Readily marketable inventories ("RMI") are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms. All of Bunge's RMI are recorded at fair value. These agricultural commodity inventories have quoted market prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing, and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. Changes in the fair values of RMI are recognized in earnings as a component of Cost of goods sold.
Inventories other than RMI are stated at the lower of cost or market by inventory product class. Cost is determined using primarily the weighted-average cost method.
Fair Value Measurements—Bunge determines fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Bunge determines the fair values of its readily marketable inventories, derivatives, and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of Bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect Bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value.
F-11


Level | Description | Financial Instrument (Assets / Liabilities) 
Level 1 | Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. | Exchange traded derivative contracts.Marketable securities in active markets. 
Level 2 | Observable inputs, including adjusted Level 1 quotes, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. | Exchange traded derivative contracts (less liquid market).Readily marketable inventories. Over-the-counter (‘‘OTC’’) commodity purchase and sale contracts. OTC derivatives whose value is determined using pricing models with inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices, adjusted for location specific inputs that are primarily observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.Marketable securities in less active markets.
Level 3 | Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. | Assets and liabilities whose value is determined using proprietary pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. Assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Based on historical experience with Bunge’s suppliers and customers, Bunge’s own credit risk, and knowledge of current market conditions, Bunge does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.
In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Bunge’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
Bunge’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.
The majority of Bunge's exchange traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily, generally through its clearing subsidiary and, therefore, such futures are not included in the assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Bunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and energy costs. Bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate the exposure to market variables (see Note 16, Derivative instruments and hedging activities). Additionally, commodity contracts relating to forward sales of commodities in the Company’s Agribusiness segment, such as soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat, are accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815 (see Revenue Recognition below).
Generally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. Bunge assesses at the inception of a hedge whether any derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items and, on an ongoing basis, qualitatively monitors whether that assertion is still met. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. In addition, Bunge may designate certain derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. When using forward derivative contracts as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.
F-12

Marketable Securities and Other Short-Term Investments—Bunge classifies its marketable debt securities and short-term investments as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or trading. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Held-to-maturity debt investments represent financial assets in which Bunge has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. Debt trading securities and all equity securities are recorded at fair value and are bought and held principally for selling them in the near term and therefore held for only a short period of time, with all gains (losses) included in net income (loss). Bunge monitors its held-to-maturity investments for impairment periodically and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other than temporary.
Recoverable Taxes—Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by Bunge, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These recoverable tax payments are included in other current assets or other non-current assets based on their expected realization. In cases where Bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net—Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements that extend either the life, capacity, efficiency, or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. Bunge generally capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. Interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized.
 Depreciation is computed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:
 | Years 
Buildings | 10 - 50
Machinery and equipment | 7 - 25 
Furniture, fixtures and other | 3 - 20 

Goodwill—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment, or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be the Company's operating segments or one level below the operating segments in certain instances (see Note 8, Goodwill).
Other Intangible Assets—Finite lived intangible assets primarily include trademarks, customer relationships and lists, port facility usage rights, and patents that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives, or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract (see Note 9, Other intangible assets).
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite Lived Intangible Assets—Bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits, and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures, and other external market conditions. If these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, Bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below its carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. Bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. Any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 10, Impairments).
Property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Investments in Affiliates—Bunge has investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method or cost method. Bunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential 
F-13

decline in value may be other than temporary. Bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate and Bunge's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value. (see Note 10, Impairments and Note 11, Investments in affiliates).
Revenue Recognition—The Company’s revenue comprises sales from commodity contracts that are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) and sales of other products and services that are accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Additional information about the Company’s revenues can be found in Note 28, Segment Information.
Revenue from commodity contracts (ASC 815) - Revenue from commodity contracts primarily relates to forward sales of commodities in the Company’s Agribusiness segment, such as soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn and wheat, which are accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815. These forward sales meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 as they have an underlying (e.g. the price of soybeans), a notional amount (e.g. metric tons), no initial net investment and can be net settled since the commodity is readily convertible to cash. Bunge does not apply the normal purchase and normal sale exception available under ASC 815 to these contracts. Certain of the Company’s sales in its Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, and Sugar and Bioenergy segments also qualify as derivatives, primarily sales of commodities like bulk soybean and canola oil, and sugar.
Revenue from commodity contracts is recognized in Net sales for the contracted amount when the contracts are settled at a point in time by transferring control of the commodity to the customer, similarly to revenue recognized from contracts with customers under ASC 606. From inception through settlement, these forward sales arrangements are recorded at fair value under ASC 815 with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Cost of goods sold and carried on the consolidated balance sheet as Current assets (see Note 6, Other current assets) or Current liabilities (see Note 13, Other current liabilities), respectively. Further information about the fair value of these contracts is presented in Note 15, Fair value measurements.   
Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606) - Revenue from contracts with customers accounted for under ASC 606 is primarily generated in the Company's Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy and Fertilizer segments through the sale of refined edible oil-based products such as packaged vegetable oils, shortenings, margarines and mayonnaise; milled grain products such as wheat flours, bakery mixes, corn-based products, and rice; certain sugar and bioenergy products; and fertilizer products. These sales are accounted for under ASC 606 as these sales arrangements do not meet the aforementioned criteria to be considered derivatives under ASC 815. These revenues are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and exclude sales taxes, discounts related to promotional programs and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms provide for transfer of title either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold. In contracts that do not specify the timing of transfer of legal title or transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership, judgment is required in determining the timing of transfer of control. In such cases, the Company considers standard business practices and the relevant laws and regulations applicable to the transaction to determine when legal title or the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. 
The transaction price is generally allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on observable data of the Company’s sales of such products and services to similar customers and in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Variable consideration is generally known upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. 
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold.
F-14

Warranties provided to customers are primarily assurance-type warranties on the fitness of purpose and merchantability of the Company’s goods and services. The Company does not provide service-type warranties to customers.
Payment is generally due at the time of shipment or delivery, or within a specified time frame after shipment or delivery, which is generally 30-60 days. The Company’s contracts generally provide customers the right to reject any products that do not meet agreed quality specifications. Product returns and refunds are not material.
Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue in the Agribusiness segment from ocean freight and port services over time as the related services are performed. Performance obligations are typically completed within a fiscal quarter and any unearned revenue or accrued revenues are not material. 
Share-Based Compensation—Bunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see Note 26, Share-based compensation). Bunge accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
Income Taxes—Income tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bunge's subsidiaries operate. Under Bermuda law, Bunge is not required to pay taxes in Bermuda on either income or capital gains. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes arising as a result of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in Bunge's financial statements and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if current evidence does not suggest that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in Income tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 14, Income taxes).
Research and Development—Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses were $15 million, $15 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
New Accounting Pronouncements—In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces a new accounting model, referred to as the current expected credit losses ("CECL") model, for estimating credit losses on certain financial instruments and expands the disclosure requirements for estimating such credit losses. Under the new model, an entity is required to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The guidance also amends the current impairment model for debt securities classified as available-for-sale securities. The new guidance will be effective for Bunge starting January 1, 2020. The Company will adopt the guidance under a modified-retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening Retained earnings as of the effective date. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which reduces complexity in the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. Bunge is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements—On January 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new provisions, all leases, except short-term leases, are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments under such leases. The Company elected the amended transition approach provided by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which allows entities to apply the guidance as of the date of initial application by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening Retained earnings, with no retrospective adjustments. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients that permits the Company to not reassess under the new standard prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs, as well as the practical expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease components in accounting for all classes of underlying assets. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $1,006 million of operating lease assets and $962 million of operating lease liabilities. Included in Operating lease assets at January 1, 2019 was $44 million of prepaid lease balances that were reclassified from Other non-current assets. 
On January 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  This ASU allows a 
F-15

reclassification from Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") to Retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). Consequently, the ASU eliminates the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users. However, because this ASU only relates to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in Income (loss) from continuing operations is not affected. The Company's stranded tax effects relate to unrecognized costs associated with certain pension plans for which the tax benefit was initially recorded to AOCI. Absent this ASU, the Company's policy is to release stranded tax effects upon the pension plans' termination. Upon the adoption of this ASU, the Company elected to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act, resulting in a decrease to AOCI and an increase to Retained earnings of $21 million.
On January 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The new guidance eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
2. GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS PROGRAM AND PORTFOLIO RATIONALIZATION INITIATIVES
Global Competitiveness Program - In July 2017, the Company announced a comprehensive global competitiveness program to improve its cost position and deliver increased value to shareholders (the “Global Competitiveness Program” or "GCP"). The GCP was fully implemented by the end of 2019, and has reduced the Company’s overhead costs. The Company identified key elements of its strategy to meet this goal, including adopting a zero-based budgeting process that will target excess costs in specific budget categories and improving efficiency and scalability by simplifying organizational structures, streamlining processes and consolidating back office functions globally, including the relocation of the Company’s global headquarters. As part of the GCP, Bunge offered a voluntary early retirement program to certain U.S. based salaried employees. Costs associated with the early retirement program are reflected in severance and other employee benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2017. In conjunction with the GCP, the Company has implemented other cost reduction and strategic initiatives to enhance the efficiency and performance of the Company’s business. 

F-16

The table below sets forth, by type and segment, the costs recorded for the GCP and other associated initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:    

(US$ in millions) | Agribusiness Segment | | Edible Oils Segment | | Milling Segment | | Sugar and Bioenergy Segment | Fertilizer Segment | | Total

In addition to the above charges, for the year ended December 31, 2017, $13 million of severance and other employee benefit costs were recorded related to other industrial productivity initiatives. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 $4 million, $9 million, and $35 million, respectively, of the above costs were recorded in Cost of goods sold ("COGS") and $42 million, $51 million, and $55 million, respectively, were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A").
Bunge's liability associated with the GCP and other associated initiatives is primarily comprised of accruals for severance and other employee benefit costs. The following table sets forth the activity affecting the liability for severance and other employee benefit costs related to the GCP and other associated initiatives, which is recorded in Other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

Portfolio Rationalization Initiatives - The Company's portfolio rationalization initiatives may include the sale or disposal of long-lived assets and certain other investments, resulting in certain gains and charges being recorded in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, $1,761 million, $39 million and $45 million, respectively, of such charges have been recognized. Non-cash charges in 2019, including impairment and a loss on sale, of $1,524 million, recorded in COGS, $49 million recorded in Other income (expense)-net, and $2 million, recorded in SG&A, relate to the formation of a joint venture involving the company's sugar and bioenergy operations in Brazil, as further discussed below. Additional non-cash impairment charges of $28 million, recorded in SG&A, primarily relate to operating lease assets and leasehold improvements associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters, and $152 million of non-cash impairment charges, recorded in COGS, relate to PP&E and intangible assets subject to portfolio rationalization initiatives. The Company also incurred a loss on the sale of an equity method investment of $6 million, recorded in Other income (expense)-net. Of the above charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019, $1,590 million, $100 million, $41 million, $29 million, and $1 million were recorded in the company's Sugar and Bioenergy, Agribusiness, Edible Oils Products, Milling Products, and Fertilizer segments, respectively. 
On December 2, 2019, the Company and BP completed the formation of BP Bunge Bioenergia, the Brazilian bioenergy joint venture that combines their Brazilian bioenergy and sugarcane ethanol businesses. Pursuant to the business combination agreement, the Company and BP contributed their respective interests in their Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations to the joint venture. The Company received cash proceeds of $775 million in the transaction, comprising $700 million in respect of non-recourse debt of the Company assumed by the joint venture at closing, and an additional $75 million from BP, before customary closing adjustments. The Company used the proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness under its credit facilities. The joint venture agreements provide for certain exit rights of the parties, including private sale rights beginning 18 months after closing and the ability by the Company to trigger an initial public offering of the joint venture after two years from closing, enabling future monetization potential. 
In connection with its entry into the business contribution agreement, the Company classified the assets and liabilities to be transferred to the joint venture under the business contribution agreement as held for sale in its condensed, consolidated financial statements in the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Accordingly, the Company recorded those assets and liabilities at fair value, less estimated transaction costs. As a result of the classification as held for sale, the Company recognized an impairment charge in its Sugar and Bioenergy segment, principally related to the recognition of cumulative currency translation effects, of $1,524 million, recorded in COGS, in the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Additional charges of $65 million were recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 related to a loss on sale and closing and other costs associated with the transaction.
3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSTIONS
Acquisitions
On March 1, 2018 ("the acquisition date"), Bunge acquired a 70% ownership interest in IOI Loders Croklaan ("Loders") from IOI Corporation Berhad ("IOI") for $980 million in cash. The transaction expands Bunge's value-added capabilities, reach, and scale across core geographies to establish Bunge as a global leader in business-to-business (or "B2B") oil solutions. The Loders portfolio includes a full range of palm and tropical oil-derived products with strength in confectionery, bakery and infant nutrition applications. 
F-18

The following table summarizes the allocation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, as included in Bunge's consolidated balance sheet:

(US$ in millions) | 
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 82 
Accounts receivable | 146 | 
Inventories | 406 | 
Other current assets | 66 | 
Property, plant and equipment | 411 | 
Other intangible assets | 464 | 
Goodwill | 242 | 
Total assets | 1,817 | 
Trade accounts payable | (109 | ) 
Other current liabilities | (100 | ) 
Deferred income taxes | (143 | ) 
Other non-current liabilities | (35 | ) 
Total liabilities | (387 | ) 
Redeemable noncontrolling interest | (450 | ) 
Net assets acquired | $ | 980

The $242 million of goodwill recognized was assigned to the Edible Oil Products segment. The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of Loders. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 
The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined primarily using the “income approach,” which requires a forecast of all the expected future cash flows either using the multi-period excess earnings method or the relief-from-royalty method. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset values include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, and the assessment of the intangible asset’s life cycle, as well as other factors.
The following table provides the details of other intangible assets acquired, by major class and weighted average useful life:

(US$ in millions) | Useful life | 
Customer relationships | 15 years | $ | 265
Intellectual property | 10 years | 120 | 
Trade names | 15 years | 51 | 
Favorable leases | 38 years | 26 | 
Other | various | 2 | 
Total Other intangible assets | | $ | 464

The fair value in the opening balance sheet of the 30% redeemable noncontrolling interest in Loders was estimated to be $450 million. The fair value was estimated based on 30% of the total equity value of Loders based on the transaction price for the 70% stake in Loders, considering the cash paid and the value of the put/call provisions. See Note 23 for more information related to this redeemable noncontrolling interest.

F-19

The amounts of revenue and earnings of Loders included in Bunge's consolidated statement of income from the acquisition date to December 31, 2018 is as follows:

(US$ in millions) | 
Net sales | $ | 1,331
Income (loss) from continuing operations | $ | 3 

The following represents the unaudited supplemental pro forma results of the combined entity as if Loders was acquired on January 1, 2017: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2018 | 2017 
Net sales | $ | 46,047 | $ | 47,588
Income (loss) from continuing operations | $ | 298 | $ | 129 

The supplemental pro forma amounts for Income (loss) from continuing operations above have been adjusted to reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to Property, plant and equipment and Other intangible assets had been applied on January 1, 2017. Additionally, these amounts were also adjusted to reflect additional interest expense on the $1 billion of senior notes issued in connection with the acquisition, as if such issuance occurred on January 1, 2017. Supplemental pro forma Income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was also adjusted to exclude $19 million of acquisition and integration related costs incurred in 2018, while 2017 supplemental pro forma Income (loss) from continuing operations was adjusted to include these charges.
Supplemental pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the Company's actual results of operations if the acquisition had been completed at the date indicated, nor is it necessarily an indication of future operating results. Amounts do not include any operating efficiencies or cost savings that the Company believes are achievable.
Other acquisitions
On January 30, 2018, Bunge acquired Minsa Corporation ("Minsa USA") for $75 million. As a result of the transaction, Bunge acquired two corn mills in the United States. The purchase price allocation resulted in $37 million allocated to Property, plant and equipment, $20 million to finite-lived Other intangible assets, $(1) million to other net assets and liabilities, and $19 million to Goodwill, all recorded in the Milling Products segment. 
Dispositions
On December 2, 2019, Bunge and BP plc completed the formation of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a Brazilian bioenergy joint venture. As part of the transaction, Bunge contributed its interests in its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations to the joint venture and received cash proceeds of $775 million in the transaction, comprising $700 million in respect of non-recourse debt of the Company assumed by the joint venture at closing, and an additional $75 million from BP, before customary closing adjustments. As a result of this transaction, Bunge will account for the joint venture as an equity method investment. See Note 2 for further information related to this transaction.
On December 20, 2019, Bunge announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its margarine and mayonnaise assets in Brazil. The transaction includes three production plants and the brands used for these two products. The completion of the sale is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close during 2020. In connection with this agreement, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities to be sold as held for sale in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019. The following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities included in Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019:

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net returns from these activities were $27 million and $30 million, respectively, and were included as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit (“LCs”), each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, from financial institutions and time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions' counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, and other programs in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements. 
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, time deposits and LCs of $3,409 million and $4,729 million, respectively, were presented net on the consolidated balance sheets as the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, had been met. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, time deposits, including those presented on a net basis, carried weighted-average interest rates of 3.10% and 3.76%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, total net proceeds from issuances of LCs were $3,318 million, $4,657 million and $8,174 million, respectively. These cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
5. INVENTORIES
Inventories by segment are presented below. Readily marketable inventories (“RMI”) are agricultural commodity inventories, such as soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn and wheat, carried at fair value because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets, and international pricing mechanisms. The Company engages in trading and distribution, or merchandising activities, and part of RMI can be attributable to such activities and is not held for processing. All other inventories are carried at lower of cost or net realizable value.

8. GOODWILL
Bunge performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, the Company performs an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1) verifies there are no changes to its reporting units with goodwill balances; (2) allocates goodwill to its various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (3) determines the carrying value, or book value, of its reporting units; (4) estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for such amount, but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under the income approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.

(1) | Edible Oils goodwill relates to the Loders acquisition and the Milling Products goodwill relates to the Minsa USA acquisition. See Note 3, Business acquisitions and dispositions, for complete business acquisition details.


(2) | During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to the goodwill of its Loders reporting unit. The impairment resulted from a downward revision of forecasted future cash flows, as during 2019, the Loders reporting unit did not achieve its forecasted earnings targets due to operational delays at certain facilities, as well as delays in realizing certain expected synergies from the acquisition. The fair value of the Loders reporting unit was determined based on a weighted-average discounted cash flow model, comprising different scenarios and assumptions of the long-term revenues, costs, synergies, growth rates, capital expenditures and other related cash flows associated with each scenario.


(3) | During 2019, the Company contributed its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations into a joint venture with BP, forming BP Bunge Bioenergia. As such, historical goodwill, gross of impairments, and accumulated impairment losses have been derecognized from the consolidated financial statements.

11. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES
Bunge participates in various unconsolidated joint ventures and other investments accounted for using the equity method. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with the amortization of basis differences, within Other income (expense) - net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment, and are amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. At December 31, 2019, the aggregate of all basis differences was a credit of $136 million, primarily associated with BP Bunge Bioenergia.

Other | 129 | | | 154 | 
Total | $ | 678 | | | $ | 823


(1) | These non-current assets arise primarily from Bunge's Brazilian operations and their realization could take several years.

Recoverable taxes, net—Recoverable taxes are reported net of allowances of $41 million and $27 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Judicial deposits—Judicial deposits are funds that Bunge has placed on deposit with the courts in Brazil. These funds are held in judicial escrow related to certain legal proceedings pending legal resolution and bear interest at the SELIC rate, which is the benchmark rate of the Brazilian central bank.
F-27

Income taxes receivable—Income taxes receivable includes overpayments of current income taxes plus accrued interest. These income tax prepayments are expected to be utilized to settle future income tax obligations. Income taxes receivable in Brazil bear interest at the SELIC rate.
Affiliate loans receivable—Affiliate loans receivable are primarily interest-bearing receivables from unconsolidated affiliates with a remaining maturity of more than one year.
Long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net—Bunge provides financing to farmers in Brazil, primarily through secured advances against farmer commitments to deliver agricultural commodities (primarily soybeans) upon harvest of the then-current year's crop and through credit sales of fertilizer to farmers. Certain such long-term receivables from farmers are originally recorded in Other current assets as prepaid commodity purchase contracts or secured advances to suppliers (see Note 6) and reclassified to Other non-current assets when collection issues with farmers arise and amounts become past due and resolution of matters is expected to take more than one year.
The average recorded investment in long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $186 million and $215 million, respectively. The table below summarizes Bunge's recorded investment in long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil and the related allowance amounts.

14. INCOME TAXES
Bunge operates globally and is subject to the tax laws and regulations of numerous tax jurisdictions and authorities, as well as tax agreements and treaties among these jurisdictions. Bunge's income tax provision is impacted by, among other factors, changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange rates, and Bunge's profitability in each tax jurisdiction.
Bunge has elected to use the U.S. federal income tax rate to reconcile the actual provision for income taxes.
The components of Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax are as follows:

As of December 31, 2019, Bunge has determined it has unremitted earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested of approximately $183 million and accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, Bunge would be subject to income taxes in the form of withholding taxes to the recipient for an amount of approximately $37 million.
At December 31, 2019, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2,011 million, of which $1,488 million have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $713 million in Brazil. While loss carryforwards in Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to 30% of taxable income calculated on an entity by entity basis as Brazil tax law does not allow consolidated tax filings. As a result, realization of these carryforwards may take in excess of five years. At December 31, 2018, Bunge’s pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2,909 million, of which $2,340 million had no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1,434 million in Brazil. The decrease in pre-tax loss carryforwards from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to the contribution of the Company’s Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations to the newly formed BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture. 
The remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various periods beginning in 2020 through the year 2038.
Income Tax Valuation Allowances—Bunge records valuation allowances when current evidence does not suggest that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on Bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Bunge has recorded valuation allowances of $404 million and $766 million, respectively. The net decrease of $362 million is primarily attributable to the contribution of the Company's Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations to the newly formed BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture. 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits—ASC Topic 740 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, Bunge recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent 
F-31

likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, Bunge had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $51 million and $120 million in Other non-current liabilities and $2 million and $0 million in Current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, Bunge recognized $(11) million, $(4) million and $(9) million of interest and penalty charges in Income tax expense (benefit) in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, Bunge had included accrued interest and penalties of $12 million and $23 million within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:

(US$ in millions) | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Balance at January 1, | $ | 390 | | | $ | 421 | | | $ | 409
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year | 2 | | | 41 | | | 34 |

Foreign currency translation | (5 | ) | | (19 | ) | | 40 | 
Balance at December 31, | $ | 311 | | | $ | 390 | | | $ | 421

Bunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $25 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2021 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution with the tax authorities.
Bunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the United States (federal and various states) and non-United States jurisdictions. The table below reflects the tax years for which Bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities:

 | Open Tax Years
North America | 2014 - 2019 
South America | 2013 - 2019 
Europe | 2006 - 2019 
Asia-Pacific | 2006 - 2019 

As of December 31, 2019, Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries have received income tax and penalty assessments through 2016 of approximately 5,464 million Brazilian reais (approximately $1,356 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. Bunge has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to these assessments of 7 million Brazilian reais (approximately $2 million) as of December 31, 2019.
In addition, as of December 31, 2019, Bunge’s Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,276 million Argentine pesos (approximately $21 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 6,270 million Argentine pesos (approximately $104 million). 
Management, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that Bunge will prevail on the proposed assessments (with the exception of unrecognized tax benefits discussed above) in Brazil and Argentina and is vigorously defending its position against these assessments.
Bunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $123 million, $(1) million and $89 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.
On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, commonly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Tax Act”) was signed into U.S. law.  As a result of the Tax Act and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), Bunge recognized a provisional tax expense of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the one-time transition tax (“Transition Tax”), the 
F-32

revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the accrual of incremental withholding taxes on future repatriation of earnings to the United States.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, Bunge completed its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in conjunction with filing of its 2017 U.S. income tax return, assessment of additional documentation to determine the Transition Tax, and analysis of U.S. Treasury guidance on the Tax Act. As a result, Bunge recorded a tax benefit of $26 million, primarily related to the ability to utilize additional foreign tax credits to offset future repatriation of earnings to the United States.
Bunge has elected to account for any Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) inclusion as a current period expense when incurred.
15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Bunge's various financial instruments include certain components of working capital such as trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Additionally, Bunge uses short and long-term debt to fund operating requirements. Trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, and short-term debt are stated at their carrying value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. See Note 4 for trade structured finance program, Note 12 for long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net and other long-term investments, Note 18 for long-term debt, and Note 20 for employee benefit plans. Bunge's financial instruments also include derivative instruments and marketable securities, which are stated at fair value.
For a definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to Note 1, Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.
The following table sets forth, by level, the Company’s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.

F-33


(1) | Unrealized gains on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current assets. There were $39 million and $3 million included in Other non-current assets at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.


(2) | Other includes the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets and Other non-current assets.


(3) | These payables are hybrid financial instruments for which Bunge has elected the fair value option.


(4) | Unrealized losses on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current liabilities. There were $1 million and $33 million included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Readily marketable inventories—RMI reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where the Company's inventories are located. In such cases, the inventory is classified within Level 2. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3.
If the Company used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ.
Derivatives—The majority of exchange traded futures and options contracts and exchange cleared contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. The Company's forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are classified as derivatives along with other OTC derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates, and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 as described below. The Company estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. These differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2.
OTC derivative contracts include swaps, options and structured transactions that are generally fair valued using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets which are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. These valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market.
 Marketable securities and investments are comprised of government treasury securities, corporate debt securities and other investments. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Marketable securities and investments with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as level 1. Marketable securities and investments with less-liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes and classified as level 2. 
Level 3 Measurements
The following relates to Level 3 measurements. An instrument may transfer into or out of Level 3 due to inputs becoming either observable or unobservable. 
Level 3 Readily marketable inventories and other—The significant unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 classification for RMI, physically settled forward purchase and sale contracts, and trade accounts payable, relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of Brazil and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, the Company uses proprietary information such as purchase and sale contracts and contracted prices to value freight, premiums and discounts in its contracts. Movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle.
F-34

Level 3 Derivatives—Level 3 derivative instruments utilize both market observable and unobservable inputs within the fair value measurements. These inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes and locations.
The tables below present reconciliations for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. These instruments were valued using pricing models that management believes reflect the assumptions that would be used by a marketplace participant.

16. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage several market risks, such as interest rate, foreign currency rate, and commodity risk. Some of those hedges the Company enters into qualify for hedge accounting in the financial statements ("Hedge Accounting Derivatives") and some, while intended as economic hedges, do not qualify or are not designated for 
F-35

hedge accounting ("Economic Hedge Derivatives"). As these derivatives impact the financial statements in different ways, they are discussed separately below.
Hedge Accounting Derivatives - The Company uses derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships to manage certain of its interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. In executing these hedge strategies, the Company primarily relies on the shortcut and critical terms match methods in designing its hedge accounting strategy, which results in little to no net earnings impact for these hedge relationships. The Company monitors these relationships on a quarterly basis and performs a quantitative analysis to validate the assertion that the hedges are highly effective if there are changes to the hedged item or hedging derivative.
Fair value hedges - These derivatives are used to hedge the effect of interest rate and currency exchange rate changes on certain long-term debt. Under fair value hedge accounting, the derivative is measured at fair value and the carrying value of hedged debt is adjusted for the change in value related to the exposure being hedged, with both adjustments offset to earnings. In other words, the earnings effect of an increase in the fair value of the derivative will be substantially offset by the earnings effect of the increase in the carrying value of the hedged debt. The net impact of fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swaps is recognized in Interest expense. For cross currency swaps the changes in currency risk on the derivative are recognized in Foreign exchange gains (losses), and the changes in interest rate risk are recognized in Interest expense. Changes in basis risk are held in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized through the coupon.
Cash flow hedges of currency risk - The Company manages currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the transaction affects earnings, at which time the change in value of the currency forward is reclassified to Net sales, Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses. These hedges mature at various times through December 2020. Of the amount currently in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), $5 million is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months.
Cash flow hedges of commodity risk - The Company manages commodity price risk on certain forecasted purchases and sales with commodity futures. The change in the value of the future is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the transaction affects earnings, at which time the change in value of the commodity future is reclassified to Net sales or Cost of goods sold. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no open cash flow hedges of commodity risk. 
Net investment hedges - The Company hedges the currency risk of certain of its foreign subsidiaries with currency forwards and intercompany loans for which the currency risk is remeasured through Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For currency forwards, the forward method is used. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the transaction affects earnings.

The table below provides information about the balance sheet values of hedged items and the notional amount of derivatives used in hedging strategies. The notional amount of the derivative is the number of units of the underlying (for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap). The notional amount is used to compute interest or other payment streams to be made under the contract and is a measure of the Company’s level of activity. The Company discloses derivative notional amounts on a gross basis.

Economic Hedge Derivatives - In addition to using derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships, the Company enters into derivatives to economically hedge its exposure to a variety of market risks it incurs in the normal course of operations.
Interest rate derivatives are used to hedge exposures to the Company's financial instrument portfolios and debt issuances. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is primarily presented in Interest expense.
Currency derivatives are used to hedge the balance sheet and commercial exposures that arise from the Company's global operations. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold when hedging commercial exposures and Foreign exchange gains (losses) when hedging monetary exposures.
Agricultural commodity derivatives are used primarily to manage the Company's inventory and forward purchase and sales contracts. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
The Company uses derivative instruments referred to as forward freight agreements ("FFA") and FFA options to hedge portions of its current and anticipated ocean freight costs. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
The Company uses energy derivative instruments to manage its exposure to volatility in energy costs. Hedges may be entered into for natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil, including bunker fuel. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
The Company may also enter into other derivatives, including credit default swaps and equity derivatives to manage exposure to credit risk and broader macroeconomic risks, respectively. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.

17. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES
Bunge's short-term borrowings are typically sourced from various banking institutions and the U.S. commercial paper market. Bunge also borrows from time to time in local currencies in various foreign jurisdictions. Interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, and charges on certain lending transactions. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 13.83% and 6.98%, respectively.

 | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2019 | | 2018
Lines of credit: | | | | 
Unsecured, variable interest rates from 2.63% to 60.00% | $ | 771 | | $ | 750
Total short-term debt (1) | $ | 771 | | $ | 750


(1) | Includes $348 million and $136 million of local currency borrowings in certain Central and Eastern European, South American and Asia-Pacific countries at a weighted average interest rate of 27.16% and 23.61% as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Bunge's commercial paper program is supported by committed back-up bank credit lines (the ‘‘Liquidity Facility’’) equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are required to be rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s Investor Services. The cost of borrowing under the Liquidity Facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuance under our commercial paper program. At December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings were outstanding under the Liquidity Facility. The Liquidity Facility is our only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings.
In addition to the committed facilities discussed above, from time-to-time, Bunge Limited and/or its financing subsidiaries enter into uncommitted bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary based on its financing requirements. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under these bilateral short-term credit lines. Loans under such credit lines are non-callable by the respective lenders. In addition, Bunge's operating companies had $771 million in short-term borrowings outstanding from local bank lines of credit at December 31, 2019 to support working capital requirements.

(1) On December 16, 2019, Bunge extended the existing three-year revolving credit facility totaling $1.75 billion, scheduled to mature on December 12, 2020, for two additional years, to December 12, 2022.

(2) | On July 1, 2019, Bunge refinanced its unsecured Japanese yen 28.5 billion and $85 million Term Loan Agreement, dated as of December 12, 2014, which extends the maturity date to July 1, 2024.


(3) | Includes secured debt of $15 million and $17 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

The fair values of long-term debt, including current portion are calculated based on interest rates currently available on comparable maturities to companies with credit standing similar to that of Bunge. The carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt are as follows:

 | December 31, 2019 | | December 31, 2018 
(US$ in millions) | CarryingValue | | Fair Value(Level 2) | | CarryingValue | Fair Value(Level 2)
Long-term debt, including current portion | $ | 4,223 | | $ | 4,319 | | $ | 4,622 | $ | 4,584

On December 16, 2019, Bunge entered into an amendment and restatement agreement (the “Amendment and Restatement Agreement”) which amends and extends its unsecured $1.75 billion revolving credit facility entered into on December 12, 2017 (as amended by the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the “Revolving Credit Facility”), adding a sustainability-linked mechanism to the facility. Through the sustainability-linked mechanism, the interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility is tied to five sustainability performance targets that highlight and measure Bunge’s continued advancement of its sustainability initiatives across the following three areas: 1) reducing greenhouse gas emissions by improving industrial efficiency; 2) increasing traceability for main agricultural commodities; and 3) supporting increasing levels of adoption of sustainable practices across the wider soybean and palm supply chain. Bunge may from time to time, with the consent of the agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments in an amount not to exceed $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on December 12, 2022. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which will vary from 0.30% to 1.30%, based on the senior long-term unsecured debt ratings provided by Moody’s Investors Services Inc. and S&P Global Ratings. Amounts under 
F-41

the Revolving Credit Facility that remain undrawn are subject to a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 35% of the margin specified above, which will vary based on the rating level at each such quarterly payment date. Bunge also will pay a fee that will vary from 0.10% to 0.40% based on its utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019, under the Revolving Credit Facility.
In November 2019, the $700 million credit facility maturing in May 2023 was converted into a term loan and then transferred to the recently formed joint venture, BP Bunge Bioenergia, on a non-recourse basis.
At December 31, 2019, Bunge had $4,315 million of unused and available borrowing capacity under its committed long-term credit facilities with a number of lending institutions.
Certain property, plant and equipment and investments in consolidated subsidiaries having a net carrying value of approximately $45 million at December 31, 2019 have been mortgaged or otherwise collateralized against long-term debt of $16 million at December 31, 2019.
Principal Maturities—Principal maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2019 are as follows:

Total (1) | $ | 4,204


(1) | Excludes components of long-term debt attributable to fair value hedge accounting of $37 million and deferred financing fees and unamortized premiums of $18 million.

Bunge's credit facilities and certain senior notes require it to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth, minimum current ratio, a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and limitations on secured indebtedness. Bunge was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2019.
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Bunge paid interest, net of interest capitalized, of $327 million, $306 million and $236 million, respectively.
19. TRADE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM
Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program (the "Program") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the "Purchasers") that provides for funding of up to $800 million against receivables sold into the Program. The Program is designed to enhance Bunge's financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations. In connection with the Program, certain of Bunge's U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries that originate trade receivables may sell eligible receivables in their entirety on a revolving basis to a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Bunge Securitization B.V. ("BSBV") formed under the laws of the Netherlands. BSBV in turn sells such purchased trade receivables to the administrative agent (acting on behalf of the Purchasers) pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement. In connection with these sales of accounts receivable, Bunge receives a portion of the proceeds up front and an additional amount upon the collection of the underlying receivables, which is expected to be generally between 10% and 15% of the aggregate amount of receivables sold through the Program.
Koninklijke Bunge B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the Program. The Program terminates on May 26, 2021. The trade receivables sold under the program are subject to specified eligibility criteria, including eligible currencies, and country and obligor concentration 
F-42

limits. On February 19, 2019, Bunge exercised a portion of the $300 million accordion feature under this program to increase the aggregate size of the facility by $100 million to an aggregate of $800 million.

Deferred purchase price included in Other current assets | $ | 105 | | $ | 128

The table below summarizes the cash flows and discounts of Bunge's trade receivables associated with the Program. Servicing fees under the Program were not significant in any period.

 | Years Ended December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2019 | | 2018 | 2017
Gross receivables sold | $ | 10,120 | | $ | 9,803 | $ | 10,022
Proceeds received in cash related to transfer of receivables | $ | 9,868 | | $ | 9,484 | $ | 9,734 
Cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold | $ | 8,434 | | $ | 9,173 | $ | 9,659 
Discounts related to gross receivables sold included in SG&A | $ | 15 | | $ | 14 | $ | 9 

Non-cash activity for the program in the reporting period is represented by the difference between gross receivables sold and cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold.
Bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is limited to the deferred purchase price (the "DPP"), included in Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 6). The DPP will be repaid in cash as receivables are collected, generally within 30 days. Delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were insignificant.
20. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Certain United States, Canadian, European, Asian and Brazilian-based subsidiaries of Bunge sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees of the subsidiaries. The plans provide benefits primarily based on participant salaries and lengths of service. The funding policies for Bunge's defined benefit pension plans are determined in accordance with statutory funding requirements. The most significant defined benefit plan is in the United States. 
Certain United States and Brazilian-based subsidiaries of Bunge have benefit plans to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible retired employees of those subsidiaries. The plans require minimum retiree contributions and define the maximum amount the subsidiaries will be obligated to pay under the plans. Bunge's policy is to fund these costs as they become payable.
 Plan amendments and pension liability adjustment - In 2018, Bunge's Swiss defined benefit pension plan changed its local pension provider, resulting in a change to its conversion rate. This plan amendment resulted in a $13 million increase in benefit obligation as of the year ended December 31, 2018.
On September 19, 2017, Bunge approved changes to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans. These changes freeze the plans for future benefit accruals effective January 1, 2023, and these plans are closed for participation for employees hired on or after January 1, 2018. As a result, Bunge remeasured the projected benefit obligations for these plans as of September 30, 2017 and recognized a $31 million pension curtailment gain and $18 million remeasurement loss, recorded in Other comprehensive income, at September 30, 2017.
In addition, in 2017, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement program to qualifying U.S. based salaried employees. The employees that accepted the offer received an enhanced retirement benefit in the defined benefit pension plans. The Company incurred $10 million of additional defined benefit expenses relating to the program as of December 31, 2017, which are reflected in the tables below. 
F-43

Cost of Benefit Plans - Service cost is recognized in a period determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to services rendered by employees during that period. Interest cost is the amount recognized in a period determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. Amortization of net loss represents the recognition in net periodic cost over several periods of amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss). Service cost is included in the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while the other components of net periodic benefit pension cost are presented separately in Other income (expense), net.
The components of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

Assumptions used in Pension Calculations - At December 31, 2019, a 7.2% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2019 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 6.9% by 2038, and remaining at that level thereafter. At December 31, 2018, a 7.7% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2018 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 7.4% by 2038, and remaining at that level thereafter.
A one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:

The sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. These rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. The plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested.
In estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held, or anticipated to be held, by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. Cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that the expected returns would be affected by them. As assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes.
Plan Transfers In and Out - As a result of the March 1, 2018 Loders acquisition, there was a transfer into Bunge's defined benefit pension plan resulting in a $211 million increase in benefit obligation and $181 million increase in the fair value of plan assets during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant transfers into or out of Bunge's employee benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2019.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were settlements to Bunge's Swiss defined benefit pension plan as a result of the GCP, resulting in a $28 million decrease in benefit obligation, and a change to a defined contribution plan, resulting in a $27 million decrease in benefit obligation. There were no significant settlements in Bunge's employee benefit plans during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Accumulated benefit obligation | $ | 1,171 | | $ | 938
Fair value of plan assets | $ | 964 | | $ | 758

Pension Benefit Plan Assets—The objectives of the plans' trust funds are to sufficiently diversify plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing returns, with a target asset allocation of approximately 60% fixed income securities and approximately 40% equities. Bunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of indexed mutual funds and a proprietary portfolio of fixed income securities. Bunge's policy is not to invest plan assets in Bunge Limited shares. Plan investments are stated at fair value. For a further definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to Note 15.
The fair values of Bunge's defined benefit pension plans' assets at the measurement date, by category, are as follows:

2024 | 58 | | | 5 | 
2025 and onwards | 309 | | | 23 | 

Employee Defined Contribution Plans—Bunge also makes contributions to qualified defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Contributions to these plans amounted to $16 million, $10 million and $11 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Bunge annually purchases agricultural commodity products from certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party purchases comprised between 2% and 5% of total Cost of goods sold in each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Bunge also sells agricultural commodity products to certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party sales comprised between 1% and 2% of total Net sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 
In addition, Bunge receives services from and provides services to its unconsolidated investees, including tolling, port handling, administrative support, and other services. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, such services were not material to our consolidated results. 
F-48

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, receivables and payables related to the above related party transactions, and included in Trade accounts receivable and Trade accounts payable, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets were not material.
Bunge believes all transaction values to be similar to those that would be conducted with third parties.
22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Bunge is party to claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in South America, arising in the normal course of business. Bunge is also involved from time to time in various contract, antitrust, environmental litigation and remediation and other litigation, claims, government investigations and legal proceedings. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. Bunge records liabilities related to legal matters when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility that a liability arising from these matters could have a material adverse impact in the period the uncertainties are resolved should the liability substantially exceed the amount of provisions included in the consolidated balance sheets. Included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are the following amounts related to these matters:

 | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | 2019 | | 2018
Non-income tax claims | $ | 23 | | | $ | 94 
Labor claims | 50 | | | 78 | 
Civil and other claims | 88 | | | 95 | 
Total | $ | 161 | | | $ | 267

Brazil Indirect Taxes
Non-income tax claims - These tax claims relate to claims against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries, primarily value-added tax claims (ICMS, ISS, IPI and PIS/COFINS). The determination of the manner in which various Brazilian federal, state and municipal taxes apply to the operations of Bunge is subject to different interpretations arising from the complex nature of Brazilian tax law. In addition to the matter discussed below, Bunge monitors other potential claims in Brazil regarding these value-added taxes. In particular, Bunge monitors the Brazilian federal and state governments’ responses to recent Brazilian Supreme Court decisions invalidating on constitutional grounds certain ICMS incentives and benefits granted by various states. While Bunge was not a recipient of any of the incentives and benefits that were the subject of these Supreme Court decisions, it has received other similar tax incentives and benefits which are being challenged before the Supreme Court. In August 2017, Complementary Law 160/2017 (“LC 160/2017”) was published, authorizing the states, through an agreement to be reached within the framework of CONFAZ (National Council of Fiscal Policy), to grant amnesty for tax debts arising from existing tax benefits granted without previous CONFAZ authorization and to maintain such existing benefits still in force for up to 15 years. In December 2017, Interstate Agreement ICMS 190/2017 was published to regulate Complementary Law 160/2017, which endorsed the past incentives granted by the Brazilian states at CONFAZ. The states have validated their incentives in accordance with this legislation. Considering that Bunge has not received any tax assessment from the states that granted these incentives or benefits related to their validity and, based on Bunge's evaluation of this matter as required by U.S. GAAP, no liability has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
On February 13, 2015, Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court ruled in a leading case that certain state ICMS tax credits for staple foods (including soy oil, margarine, mayonnaise and wheat flours) are unconstitutional. Bunge, like other companies in the Brazilian food industry, is involved in several administrative and judicial disputes with Brazilian states regarding these tax credits. While the leading case does not involve Bunge the leading case decision will be a precedent and should be applicable to Bunge and other companies. Based on management’s review of the ruling and its general application to Bunge’s pending cases, management recorded a liability in the fourth quarter of 2014. Since 2015, Bunge settled a portion of its outstanding liabilities in amnesty programs in certain Brazilian states. In October 2019, Bunge resolved outstanding liabilities in the Brazilian state of 
F-49

Rio Grande do Sul. Bunge paid 110 million Brazilian reais (approximately $27 million) in December 2019 and will pay another 58 million Brazilian reais (approximately $14 million) in 2020 or 2021.
As of December 31, 2019, the Brazilian federal and state authorities have concluded examinations of the ICMS and PIS COFINS tax returns and have issued outstanding claims (plus applicable interest and penalties) of the following amounts:

 | | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | Years Examined | 2019 | 2018
ICMS | 1990 to Present | $ | 221 | $ | 264
PIS/COFINS | 2004 through 2016 | $ | 268 | $ | 231

Argentina Export Tax
Since 2010, the Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities in the country. In that regard, Bunge has been subject to a number of assessments, proceedings, and claims related to its activities. During 2011, Bunge’s subsidiary in Argentina paid $112 million of accrued export tax obligations under protest and preserved its rights with respect to such payment. In 2012, the Argentine government suspended Bunge’s Argentine subsidiary from a registry of grain traders. While the suspension has not had a material adverse effect on Bunge’s business in Argentina, these actions have resulted in additional administrative requirements and increased logistical costs on domestic grain shipments within Argentina. Bunge challenged these actions in the Argentine courts and in December 2019 the Federal Chamber of Córdoba ruled in favor of Bunge and reinstated Bunge into the registry.
Labor claims — The labor claims are principally claims against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries. The labor claims primarily relate to dismissals, severance, health and safety, salary adjustments and supplementary retirement benefits.
Civil and other claims — The civil and other claims relate to various disputes with third parties, including suppliers and customers.
During the first quarter of 2017, Bunge received a notice from the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense ("CADE") initiating an administrative proceeding against its Brazilian subsidiary and two of its employees, certain of its former employees, several other companies in the Brazilian wheat milling industry, and others for alleged anticompetitive activities in the north and northeast of Brazil. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2018, Bunge received a notification from CADE that it has extended the scope of an existing administrative proceeding relating to alleged anticompetitive practices in the Rio Grande port in Brazil to include certain of Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries and certain former employees of those subsidiaries. Bunge is defending against these actions; however, the proceedings are at an early stage and Bunge cannot, at this time, reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or sanctions, if any, which may be imposed.
Guarantees—Bunge has issued or was a party to the following guarantees at December 31, 2019:

(US$ in millions) | MaximumPotentialFuturePayments
Unconsolidated affiliates guarantee (1)(2) | $ | 300
Residual value guarantee (3) | 254 | 
Total | $ | 554


(1) | Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, a Bunge subsidiary has guaranteed the obligations of two of its affiliates and in connection therewith has secured its guarantee obligations through a pledge of one of its affiliate's shares plus loans receivable from the affiliate to the financial institutions in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced. Based on the amounts drawn under such debt facilities at December 31, 2019, Bunge's potential liability was $168 million, and it has recorded a $16 million obligation related to these guarantees.

F-50


(2) | Bunge has issued guarantees to certain third parties related to the performance of its unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the completion date of a port terminal which is expected to be completed in 2020. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. At December 31, 2019, Bunge's maximum potential future payments under these performance guarantees was $46 million, and no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees.


(3) | Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2020 through 2026. At December 31, 2019, no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. Any obligation recorded would be recognized in Current operating lease obligations or Non-current operating lease obligations.

Bunge Limited has provided a guaranty to the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee for Bunge North America, Inc. ("BNA"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by BNA, to grain producers and/or depositors in the State of Illinois who have delivered commodities to BNA's Illinois facilities. 
In addition, Bunge Limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the outstanding indebtedness under certain credit facilities entered into, and senior notes issued by its 100% owned subsidiaries. At December 31, 2019, Bunge's consolidated balance sheet includes debt with a carrying amount of $4,688 million related to these guarantees. This debt includes the senior notes issued by two of Bunge's 100% owned finance subsidiaries, Bunge Limited Finance Corp. and Bunge Finance Europe B.V. There are largely no restrictions on the ability of Bunge Limited Finance Corp. and Bunge Finance Europe B.V. or any other Bunge subsidiary to transfer funds to Bunge Limited. 
Commitments—At December 31, 2019, Bunge had approximately $705 million of purchase commitments related to inventories, $190 million of freight supply agreements, not accounted for as leases, $42 million of power supply contracts, $39 million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress, and $89 million other purchase commitments and obligations, such as take-or-pay contracts, throughput contracts, and debt commitment fees.
23. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
In connection with the acquisition of a 70% ownership interest in Loders, the Company has entered into a put/call arrangement with the Loders' minority shareholder and may be required or elect to purchase the additional 30% ownership interest in Loders within a specified time frame. 
The Company classifies these redeemable equity securities outside of permanent stockholders’ equity as the equity securities are redeemable at the option of the holder. The carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests is the greater of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss, equity capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption value. Any resulting increases in the redemption amount, in excess of the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss, equity capital contributions and distributions, are affected by corresponding charges against Retained earnings. Additionally, any such charges to Retained earnings will affect Net income (loss) available to Bunge common shareholders as part of Bunge's calculation of earnings per common share.
24. EQUITY
Share Repurchase Program—In May 2015, Bunge established a program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of Bunge's issued and outstanding common shares. The program has no expiration date. Bunge did not repurchase any common shares during the year ended December 31, 2019. Total repurchases under the program from its inception in May 2015 through December 31, 2019 were 4,707,440 shares for $300 million. 
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares—Bunge has 6,899,683, 4.875% cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares (convertible preference shares), par value $0.01 outstanding at December 31, 2019. Each convertible preference share has an initial liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accumulated unpaid dividends up to a maximum of an additional $25 per share. As a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on Bunge Limited's common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds, each convertible preference share is convertible at any time at the holder's option into approximately 1.2224 common shares based on a conversion price of $81.8087 per convertible 
F-51

preference share, subject in each case to certain specified anti-dilution adjustments (which represents 8,434,172 Bunge Limited common shares at December 31, 2019).
If the closing market price of Bunge's common shares equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the convertible preference shares, for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days (including the last trading day of such period), Bunge may elect to cause all outstanding convertible preference shares to be automatically converted into the number of common shares that are issuable at the conversion price. The convertible preference shares are not redeemable by Bunge at any time.
The convertible preference shares accrue dividends at an annual rate of 4.875%. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable, quarterly in arrears, on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, when, as and if declared by Bunge's Board of Directors. The dividends may be paid in cash, common shares or a combination thereof. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the convertible preference shares will not bear interest. In each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Bunge recorded $34 million of dividends, paid in cash, on its convertible preference shares.
Pension liability adjustment - On September 19, 2017, Bunge approved changes to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“Plans”). The changes were announced on September 26, 2017 to all U.S. employees of Bunge. These changes froze the Plans for future benefit accruals effective January 1, 2023, and these Plans are closed for participation for employees hired on or after January 1, 2018. As a result, Bunge remeasured the projected benefit obligations associated with the Plans as of September 30, 2017 and recognized a $31 million pension curtailment gain and $18 million remeasurement loss in Other comprehensive income (loss).
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Attributable to Bunge—The following table summarizes the balances of related after-tax components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Bunge:

(1) | Bunge has significant operating subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina, North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The functional currency of Bunge's subsidiaries is generally the local currency. During the second quarter of 2018, it was determined that Argentina's economy should be considered highly inflationary, and as such, beginning on July 1, 2018, Bunge's Argentine subsidiaries changed their functional currency from the Argentine peso to the U.S. Dollar. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at month-end exchange rates, and the resulting foreign currency translation gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This change in functional currency did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.

26. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Bunge recognized approximately $39 million, $46 million and $29 million, respectively, of total compensation expense for awards classified as equity awards related to its stock option and restricted stock unit awards.
In 2019, 2018 and 2017, Bunge granted equity awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 EIP"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2016 EIP, the Compensation Committee of Bunge's Board of Directors may grant equity based awards to officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance based or time-vested) or other equity based awards. The 2016 EIP replaced the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2009 EIP"), also a shareholder approved plan, under which, beginning May 26, 2016, no further awards may be granted. Shares issued under the 2016 EIP may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner, or a combination thereof.
Stock Option Awards—Options to purchase Bunge Limited common shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge common stock, vest over service periods that generally range from one to three years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the plans or associated award agreements. Grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis for option grants.
Restricted Stock Units—Restricted stock units ("RSUs") give recipients the right to receive shares of Bunge common stock upon the lapse of related restrictions determined by the Compensation Committee. Restrictions on RSUs may be based on continued service by the recipient through the designated term and/or based on the achievement of certain performance targets. These targets may be financial or market-based, and the number of units actually earned varies based on the level of achievement of predefined goals. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for restricted stock units. RSUs generally vest over periods ranging from one to three years. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances as defined in the plans or associated award agreements. RSUs are generally settled in shares of Bunge common stock upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms. Where share settlement may be prohibited under local law, RSUs are settled in cash. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.
Bunge has also established the Bunge Limited 2017 Non-Employee Directors' Equity Incentive Plan (the "2017 Directors' Plan"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2017 Directors' Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity based awards to non-employee directors of Bunge Limited. Awards may consist of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units and non-statutory stock options. The 2017 Directors' Plan replaced the 2007 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan, under which no further awards may be granted.
Restricted Stock Units—Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided the director continues to serve on the Board until such date, and are settled in shares of Bunge Limited common stock. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.
The fair value of each stock option granted under any of Bunge's equity incentive plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Assumptions for the prior three years are noted in the following table. The expected volatility of Bunge's common shares is a weighted average of historical volatility calculated using the daily closing price of Bunge's shares up to the grant date and implied volatilities on open option contracts on Bunge's stock as of the grant date. Bunge uses historical employee exercise behavior for valuation purposes. The expected option term of granted options represents the period of time that the granted options are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience and giving consideration for the contractual terms, vesting periods and expectations of future employee behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a term equal to the expected option term of the respective grants and grant dates.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $9.07, $16.75 and $17.13, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $1 million, $4 million and $11 million, respectively. The excess tax benefit classified as a financing cash flow was not significant for any of the periods presented.
At December 31, 2019, $8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the equity incentive plan is expected to be recognized over the next two years.

(2) | During the year ended December 31, 2019, Bunge issued 369,119 common shares, net of common shares withheld to cover taxes, including related common shares representing accrued dividends, with a weighted-average fair value of $59.79 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 31,627 performance-based restricted stock units vested. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Bunge canceled approximately 454,426 shares related to performance-based restricted stock unit awards that did not vest due to non-achievement of performance targets.

The fair value of RSU awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $53.01, $75.06 and $76.79, respectively.
F-55

At December 31, 2019, there was approximately $45 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the equity incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over the next two years. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $31 million.
Common Shares Reserved for Share-Based Awards—The 2017 Directors' Plan and the 2016 EIP provide that 120,000 and 5,800,000 common shares, respectively, are to be reserved for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other awards under the plans. At December 31, 2019, 50,408 and 1,451,918 common shares were available for future grants under the 2017 Directors' Plan and the 2016 EIP, respectively. No shares are currently available for grant under any other Bunge Limited equity incentive plan.
27. LEASES
The Company routinely leases storage facilities, transportation equipment, land, and office facilities which are typically classified as operating leases. The accounting for some of the Company's leases may require significant judgment when determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease term, and the likelihood of renewal or termination options. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets (Operating lease assets) and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments under such leases (Current operating lease obligations and Non-current operating lease obligations). As of the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially measured as the present value of lease payments not yet paid. The lease asset is initially measured equal to the lease liability and adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement (e.g., prepaid rent), lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. Over time, the lease liability is reduced for lease payments made and the lease asset is reduced through expense, classified as either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the lease. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment in a manner consistent with Property, plant and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (“short-term leases”) are not recorded on the balance sheet, and lease expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Company’s leases range in length of term, with an average remaining lease term of 5.1 years, but with certain land leases continuing for up to 92 years. Additionally, certain leases contain renewal options that can extend the lease term up to an additional 5 years. Renewal options are generally exercisable solely at the Company’s discretion. When a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised, such additional terms are considered when calculating the associated operating lease asset and liability. When determining the lease liability at commencement of the lease, the present value of lease payments is based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate determined using a portfolio approach and the Company’s incremental cost of debt, adjusted to arrive to the rate in the applicable country and for the applicable term of the lease, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2019, such weighted average discount rate was 4.5%. 
Certain of the Company’s freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and rail cars, as well as land leases associated with agricultural partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane, may include rental payments that are variable in nature. Variable payments on time charter agreements for ocean freight vessels under freight supply agreements are dependent on then current market daily hire rates. Variable payments for certain rail cars can be based on volumes, and in some cases, benchmark interest rates. In December 2019, Bunge contributed its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations to a newly formed joint-venture, BP Bunge Bioenergia. As such, the land leases associated with agricultural partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane have been contributed to BP Bunge Bioenergia, and are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. Payments under the Company's agricultural partnership agreements in Brazil, through November 2019, were dependent on the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare, the total recoverable sugar ("ATR") per ton of sugarcane produced, and the price for each kilogram of ATR as determined by Consecana, the state of São Paulo sugarcane, sugar and ethanol council. All such variable payments are not included in the calculation of the associated operating lease asset or liability subsequent to the inception date of the associated lease and are recorded as expense in the period in which the adjustment to the variable payment obligation is incurred. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements related to railcars and barges contain residual value guarantees (see Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies). None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material restrictive covenants.

Non-cancelable subleases primarily relate to agreements with third parties for the use of portions of certain facilities with remaining sublease terms of approximately six years, as well as an agreement with an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company subleases rail cars with remaining sublease terms of approximately three to four years. Additionally, the Company may enter into re-let agreements to sell the right to use ocean freight vessels under time charter agreements when excess capacity is available.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has additional operating leases for freight supply agreements on ocean freight vessels, that have not yet commenced, of $223 million. These operating leases will commence in 2020, with lease terms of up to eight years.

28. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Bunge has five reportable segments - Agribusiness, Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy, and Fertilizer, which are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, and the type and class of customer and distribution methods. The Agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. The Edible Oil Products segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. The Milling Products segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. Up until December 2019, when the Company contributed its Brazilian sugar and bioenergy operations forming the majority of our Sugar and Bioenergy segment into a joint venture with the Brazilian biofuels business of BP p.l.c, the Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily involved sugarcane growing and milling in Brazil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol production and corn-based ethanol investments and related activities. Following the classification of the Brazilian fertilizer distribution and North American fertilizer businesses as discontinued operations, the activities of the Fertilizer segment include its port operations in Brazil and Argentina and its blending and retail operations in Argentina.
The “Other” column in the following table contains the reconciliation between the totals for reportable segments and Bunge's consolidated totals, which consists primarily of amounts attributable to corporate and other items not allocated to the reportable segments, discontinued operations, and inter-segment eliminations. Transfers between the segments are generally

Total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge's management believes total segment EBIT is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industries.
A reconciliation of total segment EBIT to net income attributable to Bunge follows:
