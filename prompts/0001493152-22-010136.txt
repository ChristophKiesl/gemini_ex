ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Veroni Brands Corp. (“Veroni” or the “Company”) was incorporated as “Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation” on December 7, 2016, under the laws of the State of Delaware. In September 2017, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new stockholders, redeeming shares of existing stockholders, electing a new officer and director and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
 
In connection with the change in control, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation to European CPG Acquisition Corporation. In November 2017, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name to Veroni Brands Corp.
 
The Company is located at 2275 Half Day Road, Suite 346, Bannockburn, Illinois 60015. The Company’s main phone number is 888-794-2999. The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. Neither the Company nor its predecessors have filed for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor are in the process of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings.
 
Our Business
 
The Company operates in the consumer packaged goods industry and it is focused on the import, sale and distribution of premium chocolate and snack products produced in Europe. The Company also serves as a supplier of confectionery products for major U.S. retailers under private label brands. The Company has established itself as a vendor of record with national retail chains across the United States and other well-known international retailers allowing its products to be sold in thousands of stores in the United States.
 
Our goal is to develop multiple brands of consumer packaged goods and become one of the leading suppliers and distributors in the United States of premium chocolate, snacks and beverage products from Europe. Our wide range of premium chocolate, snacks and beverage items allowed us to establish strong relationships with national retail chains across the United States and international retailers.
 
The Company is also seeking opportunities to merge with emerging brand companies that established themselves and their respective brand portfolio of items and are in need to access our national distribution network. We believe that a potential merger would give Veroni much bigger presence within national retailers in the United States and add variety of other products that Veroni can sell to its retailers and wholesalers in the consumer package goods space.
 
Our Market and Industry
 
Veroni’s primary markets include dollar stores, multi-outlets, grocery stores, convenience stores, distributors, and retailers across the U.S., with dollar stores accounting for approximately 50% of sales. As between sales of branded items versus private label products, private label currently accounts for approximately 60% of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had two customers whose sales accounted for approximately 72% of revenue.

Confectionery Market Overview. According to IBISWorld, the revenue of the U.S. confectionery wholesaling market size for 2022 is $53.6 billion, and annual revenue growth for the past five years was around -0.1%. Revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of 1.1% over the next four years to 202. The major segments purchasing confectionery products include wholesalers, grocery stores and markets, mass merchandisers and convenience stores. The next five years are expected to maintain a positive outlook for the U.S. confectionery industry. Continued economic recovery will further boost consumer spending on confectionery and snacks, especially on gourmet, premium dark chocolate and gummy candy products.
 
Chocolate Market Overview. According to Statista, chocolate and confectionery consumption in the U.S. is expected to continue its upward trend (from $139.9 billion in 2019 to $165.2 billion by 2023), supported by population growth and rising purchasing power. Consumers are becoming more aware of the health effects associated with consuming excessive sugar and fat. As a response to changing preferences, low-calorie, reduced sugar and more nutritious types of chocolate are becoming more popular. Premium, dark and organic chocolates are key products benefitting from this trend.
 
The chocolate production industry is moderately concentrated with the top four players (Hershey, Mars, Ferrero and Lindt) accounting for 60.6% of market share in 2019, according to IBIS World. The industry has consolidated over the past five years through acquisitions. In the past five years, industry producers have experienced stable competition from foreign chocolate producers. Although brand recognition is important in this industry, as many brands have been in the market for decades, producers of chocolate compete based on the quality of their products, as determined by taste, quality of ingredients and more recently, nutritional value.
 
Within the food industry, the global health and wellness sector is witnessing a “healthy” boom that shapes the ever-growing market as never before. Increasingly, consumers are developing food sensitivities and adopting healthier and more active lifestyles, leading them to seek healthier nutritional alternatives and consume fresh and organic food.
 
Growth Strategy
 
The Company plans to implement a multi-layered growth strategy, focusing on product enhancement and operational expansion. Veroni proposes to enhance its product offering by partnering with reputable suppliers. It also plans to scale the import, sale, and distribution of premium European chocolate and confectionery items to operate efficiently within key U.S. markets. The strategy focuses on:

● | Widening our product portfolio. We plan to on introducing a healthy snack segment comprised of items such as fruit and nut bars, and protein and grain bars. These products will have no GMOs, zero trans-fat, no artificial colors or flavors, and will be Halal and Kosher certified.

● | Seeking Strategic Mergers and Acquisitions. Scaling through mergers and acquisitions, particularly vertical integration, to improve operating profit and margins. If distribution channels can be consolidated, operations can be streamlined, and cost inefficiencies can be reduced to achieve economies of scale. Also, a horizontal integration strategy would allow the Company to progressively consolidate the perishable and non-perishable goods within its national market.

Chocolate Products
 
Veroni currently distributes its chocolate products under the Sweet Desire and Baron Chocolatier brands, as well as private label chocolate bars, cups and bites.
 
The Company is also in the process of developing its own brand and line of products:
 

● | The Company hired CA Fortune to analyze and develop the brand and create a portfolio of new products. The Company’s chocolate products are GMO free and Kosher and Halal certified, and contain all natural ingredients with zero trans-fat, no artificial flavors or colors. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company is approved and licensed by Rainforest Alliance to sell its chocolate products nationwide to its customers The Company believes that its key competitive advantage is that it can provide premium chocolate products at mainstream prices. The product is manufactured in Europe and imported via port in Germany into a warehouse near port of New Jersey and from there its being shipped across the country to its costumers’ distribution centers. 
● | The Company handles the product design and development phases in-house, in collaboration with leading product design and development teams who traditionally serve major retailers in the United States. 

 
Veroni plans to gradually increase chocolate sales by offering products made with all natural ingredients priced at a slight discount to premium brand chocolates offered by competitors such as Godiva, Russell Stover, Lindt, and Ghirardelli. It also plans to incrementally grow chocolate sales by cross-merchandising chocolate products with its retail partners’ wine and coffee products.
 
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We have established relationships with reputable manufacturers in Europe with portfolio of variety of branded products that can be imported into the United States and distributed Nationwide upon retailers’ commitments.
 
In January 2019, the Company established a working relationship with Millano SP ZOO, a Polish company (“Millano”) and a related party, to import chocolate products, as well as snacks, for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States.
 
In 2021 we expanded our warehouse and logistics capabilities by engaging Roadtex Transportation Corporation who has 31 locations across the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company a tremendous opportunity to support its growth, as it will be able to store, ship and co-pack products and fulfill its purchase orders received from its national retail customers across the country.
 
Regulatory Oversight
 
Certifications. The Company’s distributed products are certified according to the ISO 22000 standards and are in line with BRC and IFS food safety requirements. ISO 22000 is a food safety management system that can be applied to any organization in the food chain. IFS is a Global Food Safety Initiative recognized standard for certifying the safety and quality of food products and production processes. The BRC Global Standard for Food Safety began in the U.K. to help the food industry meet legislative requirements of the European Union General Product Safety Directive and the U.K. Food Safety Act.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation. For the purchase of products harvested or manufactured outside the United States, and for the shipment of products to customers located outside the United States, the Company is subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Its activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted on January 4, 2011, amended section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), in relevant part, to require that facilities engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding food for consumption in the United States submit additional registration information to FDA, including an assurance that FDA will be permitted to inspect the facility at the times and in the manner permitted by the FD&C Act. Section 415 of the FD&C Act, as amended by FSMA, also requires food facilities required to register with FDA to renew such registrations every other year, and provides FDA with authority to suspend the registration of a food facility in certain circumstances. Specifically, if FDA determines that food manufactured, processed, packed, received, or held by a registered food facility has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, FDA may by order suspend the registration of a facility that:
 

● | Created, caused, or was otherwise responsible for such reasonable probability; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Knew of, or had reason to know of, such reasonable probability; and packed, received, or held such food.

The Company’s operations may be subject to these registration requirements. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material impact on the Company’s earnings, expenditures, or competitive positioning.
 
Customers
 
Our customers are major national wholesalers and retailers that distribute and sell the Company’s products to its customers.
 
Suppliers
 
Our suppliers are licensed and possess all necessary certifications to be in compliance with FDA rules and regulations. In January 2019, the Company established a working relationship with Millano, to import various snacks and chocolate products for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, Millano supplied all of the Company’s product purchases.
Operations
 
Veroni begins its product development process by generating new ideas for products. Product and packaging samples are then commissioned to the suppliers for testing and quality assurance. When a product design is finalized and a price is confirmed with suppliers and manufacturers, a purchase order is placed. Products are manufactured through suppliers in Europe that procure their own raw materials for finished and packaged products. Typically, the manufacturing process takes 4 to 6 weeks. After manufacturing is completed, the Company organizes shipment and/or storage, depending on agreements with retailers and third-party distributors. On average, the lead time from order processing to product delivery is approximately 13 weeks.
 
As of the date of this report, the current COVID-19 crisis has resulted in the Company experiencing longer lead times in obtaining product from its manufacturers and shipping to its customers.
 
Competition
 
The Chocolate industry has many large competitors specializing in various types of confectionary products from all over the world. We currently concentrate our product lines on European heritage and its flavors that offers “Better for You” product without GMO. While it is our contention that our competition is much more limited than the entire chocolate and candy industry based on our products’ niche market, there can be no assurances that we do not compete with the entire chocolate and candy industry. We believe our principal competitors include Hershey, Godiva, Russell Stover, Lindt, and Ghirardelli, all of whom are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources than we do.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following strengths position us for sustainable growth:
 

● | Strong consumer loyalty. Many of our consumers are loyal and enthusiastic brand advocates who actively communicate with us through our costumer’s website and/or social media channels. We believe that this consumer interaction has generated interest in our products and has inspired enthusiasm for our customers brands. We also believe that enthusiasm for our products has led and will continue to lead to repeat purchases and new consumers trying our products. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our distribution network. Our diverse distribution network all around the world, Veroni has been able to prosper and earn a reputable name 
● | Market Research. Extensive market research allows us to identify and provide our clients with premium products and keep steady relationships with both suppliers and retailers.
