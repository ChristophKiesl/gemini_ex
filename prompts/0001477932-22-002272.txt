ITEM 1. BUSINESSCompany Overview

We are a biotechnology company dedicated to eradicating zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus), Paratuberculosis (Johne’s disease), Mad Cow Disease, Chronic Wasting Disease, and E.coli and Salmonella infections, by applying our advanced proprietary molecular sciences and technologies. Diseases of terrestrial, avian and aquatic life animals influence a number of economic and global security issues, including food for an increasing world population, access to international trade, species conservation and protection of those endangered, and economic growth in developing and re-organizing nations. Because more than 80% of animal bacteria and viruses are zoonotic (i.e. transmissible between humans and animals, causing infection in both species), their management and prevention are crucial to improving public health on a global scale. Zoonotic diseases are the major cause of global pandemics throughout human history. These diseases are capable of altering human history by causing significant loss of life, and major economic and social upheaval. We focus on developing novel molecular diagnostic tests, therapeutics, and vaccines through our proprietary robotic technologies with the belief that improved technologies and methodologies must be developed and implemented in order to aid mankind’s control of emerging diseases in animals and in humans. We believe that, if not properly addressed, diseases in animals will continue to cause serious and growing global problems with respect to economics, human health and biodiversity.

We previously developed proprietary diagnostic assays for use in the agricultural and veterinary markets, and we intent to develop proprietary, genetics-based diagnostic assays and vaccine solutions through our robotic technologies with the goal of controlling the spread of zoonotic infection in the human population. Our mission is to continually apply our scientific research to the more effective management of zoonotic diseases and, in so doing, realize the commercial potential of our molecular biotechnologies.

We will require significant additional funding in order to implement our business plan. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in securing the required financing, and if such financing is secured, there is no guarantee that we will fully achieve our business goals.

Target Zoonotic Diseases

COVID-19

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS- CoV-2. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, and loss of smell. The majority of cases result in mild symptoms. However, some cases progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus is the latest example of a long list of viruses and bacteria that can cause widespread global infection in humans. As of early June 2020, the number of infectious cases worldwide were close to seven and a half million with more than 415,000 deaths. In December 2019, SARS- Cov-2 was first discovered in the city of Wuhan, China. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The SARS-Cov-2 is a genetically mutated strain of the SARS-Cov-1 virus that caused SARS in 2003-2004 epidemic. Coronaviruses are opportunistic viruses that are harbor in the Asian bat population. Pangolins, nocturnal mammals, native to Asia and Africa especially tropical forests, are the most likely intermediate carriers of the SARS-Cov-2 between bats and humans. In 2002–03, Civet cats, nocturnal mammals found in Asia and Africa sold for meat in local markets of China’s Yunnan province carried the SARS virus from bats to humans.

SARS-CoV-1 and 2’s abilities to genetically mutate through passages into humans is one of the reasons of their enhanced virulence. Coronaviruses are easily transmitted by human-to-human close contact primarily through saliva droplets. Coronaviruses are “positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. These types of viruses can replicate into human cells without using the host DNA as a template. Positive single stranded RNA viruses have genetic material that can function both as genome and messenger RNA. This feature allows the Coronaviruses to work more efficiently once it infects its target. SARS-Cov-2 is the etiological cause of COVID-19, a highly infectious respiratory disease causing an atypical pneumonia.

The mechanism of infections to humans is through saliva droplets caused by persistent cough and sneezing. Indirect contact with contaminated surfaces is another way of infection although it is not a very efficient way of transmission. Viral RNA is also being found in the stools of infected patients. SARS-Cov-2 is able to enter human cells by binding to the ACE2 cell receptor. Once inside the cells, the virus starts the process of replication by using its own RNA polymerase enzyme. The incubation time COVID-19 varies between 2-14 days. It is not clear if during the incubation period, the virus is able to infect humans.

● | Virus can survive in the air up to 3 hours and on surfaces up to 72 hours
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unknown asymptomatic transmission
--+----------------------------------


● | Global pandemic
--+----------------


Epidemiological evidences support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 neuronal cells in the medulla oblongata region of the brain could become infected with the virus. Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) are reported to be early signs of COVID-19. In some cases the neuronal infection of the medulla oblongata can contribute to a patient’s breathing problems and respiratory failure within five days from the infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters human cell by binding the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2 protein regulates cardiovascular function and is express in many human cells including lung, heart, kidney, intestine, and brain tissue. There are multiple ways the virus could invade the central nervous system. A possible mechanism of action is that the SARS-CoV-2 is in the blood of infected patients and through this infectious route binds to ACE2 receptors in the endothelial cells of the blood capillaries in the brain, breaching the blood-brain barrier and invading neurons through that route. A breached blood-brain barrier could also cause brain swelling, compressing the brain stem and affecting respiration. The cells innervating the lungs could also become infected, making involuntary respiration more difficult.


6


Evidence from experiments in mice also suggest that the virus might target the nervous system through the olfactory bulb. A study published in 2008 (Netland et al. J Virology 2008 Aug (15): 7264-7275) showed that SARS-CoV-1 — the virus that caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 — entered the brains of transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 through neurons in the nose. The virus then rapidly spread to connecting nerve cells. The extensive nerve damage was the major cause of death, even though, low levels of the virus were detected in the animals’ lungs. It is therefore possible that the respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 could be caused from the extensive neuronal damages in the cardiorespiratory area of the medulla oblongata.

Diagnostics assays and Treatment of COVID -19

Nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal swabs and saliva specimen are collected from patients to detect the SARS-Cov-2 viral infection. Viral RNA is extracted from the swab and amplified using the Real Time Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology. The COVID-19 detection molecular assay is a multi-step procedure that requires up to 72 hours to obtain a result. Because of the complexity of the assay, a limited number of samples can be manually processed daily. Limitations in the number of samples to be process is the main reason of the spreading of the COVID-19. Automated systems such as the Roche COBA 8800 are capable of processing up to 4,000 samples/daily. However, due to the sheer number of potentially infected people globally, this system could not fully meet assay demand.

Currently, no treatment is available to treat COVID-19. Influenza vaccines are not effective to stop the spread of COVID-19 infection. Several COVID-19 vaccines are currently in Phase I clinical trials. Estimated development time is between 15-18 months. Alternatively, “off label” drug combination protocols have been used, with various degree of success, to treat COVID-19 patients.

Paratuberculosis

Paratuberculosis, also known as Johne’s disease in Stage III clinical phase, is a worldwide problem in domestic livestock animals including dairy cattle, sheep and goats. A significant public health concern is associated with Paratuberculosis, which results from an infection with the Mycobacterium Avium Sub Paratuberculosis (MAP) bacteria. This bacterial organism grows very slowly, causes a gradually worsening disease condition, and is highly resistant to the infected animal’s immune defenses. Therefore, infected animals harbor the organism for years before they test positive or develop disease signs.

Major factors related to a MAP infection include:


● | Global widespread infection
--+----------------------------


● | Reduction in milk production to 25%+
--+-------------------------------------


● | High culling rate which increases costs
--+----------------------------------------


● | Link between MAP infection and Immunodeficiency Diseases
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Highest at-risk animals are young calves or pre-born
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Bacterium can survive pasteurization process
--+---------------------------------------------


● | MAP present in infant formula products
--+---------------------------------------


● | MAP present in contaminated soil, water, dairy products
--+--------------------------------------------------------


7


● | Spread in herds can occur by fecal contamination, colostrum, milk, and trans placental
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For every “clinical stage” animal in a herd, there are 15-20 silently infected plus an additional 6-8 carriers
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Seventy to ninety percent of the herds worldwide are infected with MAP. Most of the infected animals do not show any clinical signs of the disease. The majority of infected animals are capable of shedding billions of bacteria mostly in the soil and milk without ever developing clinical signs of paratuberculosis and are responsible for the spreading of the disease to other animals and for the transmission of MAP to humans, mostly through milk. Lack of routine testing has resulted in the inability of managing MAP infection worldwide. MAP is resistant to conventional pasteurization protocols. Therefore, many of the dairy products, infant formula, and milk sold in stores are contaminated with the bacterium.

Stage I: Silent, subclinical, non-detectable infection. Typically, this stage occurs in all calves, heifers, and young stock less than two years of age and many adult animals exposed to small doses of disease-causing organisms. Infected animals at this early stage are rarely detected with currently available diagnostic tests, including fecal culture or serologic tests (ELISA). This stage progresses slowly over many months or years to stage II.

Stage II: Subclinical infection. Typically, this stage occurs in older heifers or adults. Animals at this stage appear healthy but are shedding adequate numbers of Mycobacterium Avian Para tuberculosis organisms in their manure to be detected on fecal culture. Blood tests will detect some, but not all animals at this stage. Blood test (ELISA) positive animals should be confirmed positive by fecal culture.

Stage III: Clinical Johne’s disease. It is categorized as any animal with advanced infection, the onset of which is often associated with a period of stress such as recent calving. Cattle at this stage have intermittent, watery pea-soup manure. Animals lose weight and gradually drop in milk production but continue to maintain a healthy appetite. Some animals appear to recover but often relapse in the next stress period. Most of these animals are shedding billions of organisms and are positive on culture. Most are positive on serologic tests (ELISA). Clinical signs often last several weeks to months before the animals are sent to slaughter in a thin, emaciated condition. In the final and terminal aspects of stage III of the fatal disease, animals become emaciated with fluid diarrhea and develop “bottle jaw.” The carcass may not pass meat inspection for human consumption in the later phases of stage III.

MAP and Immunodeficiency Diseases

A large number of studies show that several immunodeficiency diseases including, Crohn’s Disease (CD) a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine and colon, Type 1 Diabetes and Multiple Sclerosis can be triggered by MAP. The bacterium is therefore a zoonotic infectious organism which can be transmitted through contaminate milk, infant formula and water.

MAP Related Immunodeficiency Diseases

● | Multiple Sclerosis

● | Type I Diabetes

● | Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

● | Sjogren Syndrome
--+-----------------


● | Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis

Crohn’s Disease

Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestines that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from anus to mouth, causing a wide variety of symptoms. It primarily causes abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody), vomiting, or weight loss, but may also cause complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as skin rashes, arthritis, and inflammation of the eye.

Crohn’s disease is an immunodeficiency disease, in which the body’s immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract, causing inflammation. It is classified as a type of inflammatory bowel disease. There has been evidence of a genetic link to Crohn’s disease, putting individuals with siblings afflicted with the disease at higher risk. It is understood to have a large environmental component as evidenced by the higher number of cases in western industrialized nations. Males and females are equally affected. Smokers are three times more likely to develop Crohn’s disease than non-smokers. Crohn’s disease affects between 400,000 and 600,000 people in North America. Prevalence estimates for Northern Europe have ranged from 27–48 per 100,000. Crohn’s disease tends to present initially in the teens and twenties, with another peak incidence in the fifties to seventies; although, the disease can occur at any age.

Histological alterations found in Crohn’s patients’ intestinal tract, closely resembles similar tissue changes observed in the intestine of Johne’s disease cattle.

Similar to Paratuberculosis in cattle, no known pharmaceutical or surgical cure for Crohn’s disease currently exists for humans. Furthermore, Mycobacterium Avian Paratuberculosis have been found in human patients and we believe that individuals that are genetically predisposed could be contracting the disease through digestion of MAP - infected dairy products.

Business Model

Molecular Robotic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integrated Platform (MORAP)

It has become evident from the COVID-19 global pandemic that current systems and related technologies are not capable of preventing or successfully controlling the spreads of zoonotic infectious agents. One of the features of these infectious organisms is their ability to infect both people and animals while some carriers remain asymptomatic for a period of time or for the entire duration of the infection. We believe it is imperative that during pandemic outbreaks the entire population must be tested for the presence of infection agents. In addition, we believe that AI models should be developed to analyze data and forecast zoonotic diseases outbreak and ultimately prevent epidemics and pandemics from occurring in the future. GeneThera’s goal is to develop the infrastructure of a nationwide zoonotic infectious agents “alert shield” which would operate to predict, detect and manage the spread of pandemics and ultimately prevent pandemics from developing, similar to a “nuclear shield,” which is designed to detect incoming nuclear warheads and destroy them before they can be deployed. We believe that a nationwide network of AI controlled laboratory robotic systems may be able to perform such a task.

Our business model is based on an Ultra High Throughput Molecular Robotic/AI Platform (MORAP) which combines the use of advance robotic integrated systems with AI and Machine Learning (ML) software systems. Upon development, MORAP would encompass a nationwide network of interactive molecular laboratories operated using advanced integrated robotic and machine learning cloud-based software systems, which would be able to share data and interact with each other. We believe the MORAP would be capable of processing millions of samples and collecting, storing and analyzing data. We believe that the MORAP nationwide communications network could be accomplished through advanced cloud-based software systems, machine learning and Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. MORAP could be readily replicated and scaled utilizing identical instrumentation and software.

We have designed the MORAP’s second generation molecular robotic/AI laboratory system prototype. Upon development subject to securing the requisite funding, each individual MORAP system would be capable, in a full-scale commercial platform, to perform over 100,000 samples/daily with minimal human intervention.


9


We envision the MORAP’s cloud-based AI-integrated software system with a dual purpose: 1) data obtained from each individual robotic laboratory system would be sent to the cloud to be stored where data could be analyzed and risk factors could be evaluated; and 2) each individual robotic laboratory system as part of the MORAP network could be configured in the cloud. The individual robotic laboratory systems, identical in each location, would be controlled and operated through MORAP’s cloud-based software.

The MORAP’s cloud software architecture would:


1) | Collect and analyze data from each run performed by each robotic clone;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Compare data between runs from individual robotic clones and determined risk factors;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Send commands to operate each robotic clone; and
---+-------------------------------------------------


4) | Run diagnostics for each clone and alert and possibly fix any software or hardware problem the system may experience.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Each individual robotic unit is composed of different equipment controlled by the integrated software. The MORAP cloud-base system would be function as the ‘brain’ of the entire network.

Our MORAP system is designed to targeted zoonotic diseases in general; however, we intend to focus our robotic/AI and therapeutic vaccine technologies on SARS-Cov-2 and MAP related diseases.

Zoonotic Diseases Vaccine Development

Our therapeutic vaccine technology is based on the use of CRISPR gene editing technology. CRISPR technology is a new technique that is based on the use of short RNA sequences complementary to a specific target gene. Once the RNA sequence binds to the gene, the gene is deactivated or “silenced” and no longer able to produce the specific protein. It also allows for the efficient, effective, and continuous testing, management and treatment of animal populations. We plan to deliver CRISPR modified RNA sequences motif using our proprietary PURIVAX technology. Our focus will be to develop CRISPR based vaccines for SARS-COV-2 and MAP. Our strategy is to silence the expression of gene pathways, which are activated by the infectious agents to gain entry into the host cells.

PURIVAX Technology

We have developed a large-scale process for highly purified and high viral titer (viral concentration) Adenovirus and AAV genetically engineered viruses. This technology enables us to develop Adenovirus and AAV-based recombinant DNA vaccines for zoonotic pathogens. Our PURIVAX is a purification system that dramatically improves biological purity and viral titer of recombinant Adenovirus and AAV vectors. PURIVAX is intended to completely eliminate toxic side effects associated with Adenoviruses and AAV vectors, thereby making it possible to develop highly immunogenic and safe recombinant DNA vaccines. Importantly, recombinant DNA (rDNA) vaccine technology represents a powerful tool for an innovative vaccine design process known as “genetic immunization.”

rAD and rAAV vectors are the ideal candidates for a gene delivery system. These viruses can efficiently deliver genetic material to both dividing and non-dividing cells, thereby overcoming some of the obstacles encountered with first generation retroviral vectors.

Equally important, rAD and rAAV are engineered virus genomes that contain no viral gene. One of the key features for rAD and rAAV is their ability to infect a large variety of cells. However, two technical challenges had to be overcome to fully utilize rAD and rAAV in the development of rDNA vaccines:


1. | Lack of large-scale purification system; and
---+---------------------------------------------


2. | Low viral titer.
---+-----------------


10


Traditional technologies and first-generation chromatography processes are limited both in terms of purity and yield. Due to the limitation of these purification technologies, adequate viral titers may not be achieved. We believe the result is that there is currently no efficient system to deliver immunogenic genetic sequences into cells.

This is the significance of our PURIVAX, rAD and rAAV system for rDNA vaccine development. Succinctly stated, it is designed to be able to achieve both high purity and high viral titer (up to 10e16 viral particles/eluate) based on its propriety multi-resin anion exchange chromatography system. We believe that biological contaminants such as endogenous retrovirus, bacterial, mycoplasma, non-specific nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and endotoxins are eliminated during the purification process.

Product Development

We provide a comprehensive solution that allows diagnosing, treating and managing zoonotic diseases in animals and humans. Our proprietary Molecular Robotic/AI Platform and Therapeutic strategy (MORAPAT) is design to prevent the spread of disease from animals and at the same time, allow to better control of zoonotic infectious agents. More importantly, we believe that our platform could prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria into the food chain and subsequent infection of human population. An important part of this strategy is our ability to detect the presence of a low number of infected particles in different specimen tested for the presence of zoonotic virus and bacteria such as SARS- CoV-2 and MAP. Consequentially, our platform is not only able to detect infected animals, but can also prevent human infections.

We have developed a molecular system for the detection of Mycobacterium Avian Paratuberculosis in the milk of infected dairy cows. Samples from milk obtained from supermarket shelves were either ’spiked’ with different concentrations of Mycobacterium Avian Para tuberculosis or ‘naturally processed.’ The bacterial DNA was isolated using both, manual and robotic-based DNA extraction procedures and analyzed using the real time PCR technology. Using this methodology, we can detect between two (2) and twenty (20) bacterial particles from 10 ml of milk. We believe that our test will be very useful for early detection of Mycobacterium Avian Para tuberculosis, both in milk samples and in infected cows.

We are currently evaluating several robotic systems for nucleic acid extraction. We believe that we can further increase the sensitivity of the molecular assay by using robotic driven DNA and RNA extraction methods.

We are currently developing a vaccine for MAP infection. Our approach for developing this vaccine is based on the use our Molecular Robotic/AI Platform and Therapeutic (MORAPAT) technology which also includes our PURIVAX technology, genetically engineered Adenoviral and AVV, and CRISPR technology.

At the present time, we do not have sufficient financial resources to implement further development work; therefore, we will need to secure substantial funding to continue the development of the MAP vaccine.

To date, we have developed a prototype computer program to track samples that will be received and processed in our planned commercial laboratory. This program will initially be used to track samples that will be sent out and received by our laboratory. Upon raising the additional requisite funding, of which there is no guarantee, we will then work on improving the system in order to track samples during the different phases of DNA and RNA extraction procedures. In addition, we will continue to develop a database system to store and analyze data collected during sample analysis.

Future Development Plans

We anticipate that research and development, or R&D, will be the source for both assay development and vaccine design/development. If we are successful in developing assays for different diseases, we intend to formalize the procedure into a commercial application through a series of laboratories to be owned and operated by us. We anticipate that R&D will be ongoing during the life of the Company, as this is the source for new products to be introduced to the market. Our plan is to seek new innovations in the biotechnology field. We cannot assure that we will be successful in developing or validating any new assays or, if we are successful in developing and validating any such assays, that we can successfully commercialize them or earn profits from sales of those assays. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will be able to design, develop, or successfully commercialize any vaccines as a result of our research and development efforts.

11


It is our intention to continue with the research and development and validation of the molecular tests and DNA vaccines. Future plans of the Company include initiating validation procedures for MAP and SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests.

In parallel, we will continue R&D phases for the MAP vaccine. We intend to initiate development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We plan on initiating an experimental animal protocol to determine the safety of our vaccines. Moreover, upon raising the necessary capital, we plan to initiate the experimental animal studies within 12-18 months.

If we are able to develop assays for different diseases, we intend to formalize the procedure into a commercial application through a series of laboratories to be owned and operated by us.

Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will be able to design, develop, or successfully commercialize any vaccines as a result of our research and development efforts.
Marketing Strategy

Our goal is to focus on both the domestic and international markets for the commercialization of our MORAP and MORAPAT systems.

Our marketing approach is to align ourselves with both the private sector and government agencies.

Commercial Diagnostic Testing

In the event that we are able to develop assays for the detection of diseases in animals, we intend to establish a series of diagnostic testing laboratories geographically proximate to the primary sources of individual diseases and/or according to specific available operating efficiencies. The specific number of labs to be built and operated will be based on assay demand (demand facilitated by the number of specific disease assays we develop), our ability to obtain the capital to build the labs, and our ability to successfully manage them from our principal offices.
Licensing

We intend to manage the marketing and sales of our vaccines developed as through our R&D. As we do not intend to be a vaccine manufacturer, we plan to use our licensing division to license the technology related to any vaccines that may be developed and to manage the revenue potential available from the successful development and validation of specific vaccines. We cannot provide any assurance that we will develop any vaccines or that, if they are developed, we will be able to license them successfully or that any such license will produce significant revenues.

12

Intellectual Property

We do not own any patents on any of our technology and have not filed any applications for patents in any country. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to file any patent applications or that, if we file one or more applications for patents, any patents will issue or that, if issued, the claims granted in any such patents will afford us adequate protection against competitors with similar technology.

We believe that we own common law proprietary rights with respect to our technologies and we intend to use our best efforts to protect such rights through maintaining trade secret protections and entering into confidentiality agreements.

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to endorse, we rely on trade secret protection to shield our interests.

Competition

We face competition from many companies, universities, and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Virtually all of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in product commercialization, and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development, marketing capabilities, and manufacturing capabilities that we do. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products for diseases targeted by our technologies. The development of new products for those diseases for which we are attempting to develop products could render our product candidates noncompetitive and obsolete.

Our current competitors include primarily, Roche Diagnostics, Abbott Laboratories, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., and academic and government institutions are also carrying out a significant amount of research in the field of health, particularly in the field zoonotic diseases. We anticipate that these institutions will become more aggressive in pursuing patent protection and negotiating licensing arrangements to collect royalties for the use of technologies they have developed and to market commercial products similar to those that we seek to develop, either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors. Any resulting increase in the cost or decrease in the availability of technology or product candidates from these institutions may affect our business.

Competition with respect to our robotic technologies and potential products is and will be based, among other things, on effectiveness, safety, reliability, availability, price, and patent protection. Another important factor will be the timing of market introduction of products that we may develop and for which we may receive regulatory approval. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the required animal studies or trials and approval processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor. Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop propriety products or processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often-substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales.

Several attempts have been made to develop technologies that compete with Real-time-PCR (RT-PCR). To our knowledge none of these technologies have resulted to date in any product available on the market. The field of biotechnology is very dynamic. The possibility that more advanced technologies could be developed into products that may compete with ours is very strong. However, it is very difficult to predict the length of time necessary for this scenario to take place.

Manufacturing

We do not manufacture any products. We do not intend to establish a manufacturing facility to manufacture any products that we may develop anywhere in the world.

13

Product Liability

The testing, manufacturing, and marketing of our proposed products involves an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects in animals that may receive any vaccines that we may develop and market. To the extent we elect to test, manufacture, or market veterinary vaccines and other products, we will bear the risk of product liability directly. We do not currently have product liability insurance. There is no guarantee that we can obtain product liability insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to cover any liability that we may be exposed to. In the absence of such insurance, one or more product liability lawsuits against us can be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in our ceasing operations.
Government Regulation

Our unique approach to the testing for zoonotic diseases allows us to begin commercialization of our diagnostic tests without the need for a long and enduring approval process from the USDA. USDA approval will be required for commercialization of animal vaccines. However, it is our intention not to seek, in the foreseeable future, any approval either from the USDA or the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for any of the products we develop both, diagnostic and therapeutic. It is our intention to perform any validation or clinical trials of our product both domestically and abroad. Our commercial laboratories will require a validation study to be performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. Validation studies will be performed according to each country’s guidelines. It is expected that validation studies will be conducted in collaboration with each country’s government guidelines over the next 18 to 36 month period. We will need the approval of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, before the vaccines can be manufactured or sold. The approval process for animal vaccines is time-consuming and expensive. We anticipate that such approval, if it is obtained, may require more than $75 million and may require more than two years for each vaccine for which approval is sought. Currently, we do not have the capital necessary to seek approval of any of our candidate vaccines, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise the capital necessary for such approval on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to raise the necessary capital will likely cause us to curtail or cease operations. In addition, even if we are successful in raising the capital necessary to seek approval of any vaccine, there are no assurances that such an approval will be granted, or if granted, whether we will be able to produce and sell such vaccines following such an approval in commercial quantities or to make a profit from such production and sales.
Employees

We had a total of two full-time employees as of December 31, 2021. No changes in full-time employees have occurred subsequently. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit.
