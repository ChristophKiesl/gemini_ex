ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, developing our portfolio of immuno-oncology and immunology monoclonal antibodies. We are focusing our efforts on the development of our lead product candidate, lenzilumab™, our proprietary Humaneered® (“Humaneered”) anti-human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”) monoclonal antibody. Lenzilumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been demonstrated in animal models to neutralize GM-CSF, a cytokine that we believe is of critical importance in the hyperinflammatory cascade, sometimes referred to as cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) or cytokine storm, associated with COVID-19, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) therapy and acute Graft versus Host Disease (“GvHD”) associated with bone marrow transplants. GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has been shown to reduce downstream inflammatory cytokines, prevent CRS and reduce its associated neurologic toxicities in-vivo in validated preclinical human xenograft models (Blood. 2019 Feb 14;133(7):697-709).
 
Lenzilumab has completed full enrollment in a Phase 3, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled potential registrational trial for hospitalized, hypoxic patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. If the data from the trial are favorable, based on our discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), including a Type B meeting, and in consultation with the regulatory experts at Operation Warp Speed, we plan on filing an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) application in the second quarter of 2021. If the EUA is granted, we could begin to commercialize lenzilumab for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients. We also intend to file a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) in 2021, again assuming the data from the Phase 3 trial are favorable and support such an application. Based on discussions with FDA, we understand that a BLA will require us to generate and present more clinical and manufacturing data than would be required to support an EUA. If the ACTIV-5/BET study described below is successful and completed on a timely basis, we plan to include the results in our BLA filing. COVID-19 infections are widespread and as of February 26, 2021 in the United States, there were over 28 million cases, nearly 1.8 million hospitalizations and over 510 thousand deaths. Several vaccines have been developed which show efficacy in excess of 90%, however the slow rollout of inoculations and the emergence of numerous COVID-19 variants lead us to believe the need for therapeutics to treat COVID-19 currently exists and will continue to exist.
 
Lenzilumab has been selected to be part of the ACTIV-5 “Big Effect Trial” (ACTIV-5/BET NCT). This study is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). ACTIV-5/BET is designed to determine whether certain approved therapies or investigational drugs in late-stage clinical development show promise against COVID-19 and, therefore, merit advancement into larger clinical trials. ACTIV-5/BET, currently has 17 active U.S. sites enrolling and is expected to enroll in up to 40 U.S. sites, will evaluate lenzilumab with remdesivir, compared to placebo and remdesivir, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with approximately 100 patients expected to be assigned to each study arm. We are providing lenzilumab for the study, which is fully funded by NIH.
 
Lenzilumab is also being studied in a multicenter phase 1b/2 potential registrational trial as a sequenced therapy with Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) to reduce CRS and neurotoxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) (NCT04314843). This trial currently has 10 active sites and is being conducted in partnership with Kite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Gilead company (“Kite”), which markets Yescarta. We are also in the final planning stages for a Phase 2/3 trial for lenzilumab to treat patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy (“HSCT”) who are at high and intermediate risk for acute GvHD. The trial is expected to be conducted by the IMPACT Partnership, a collection of 22 stem cell transplant centers located in the United Kingdom.
 
Our proprietary, patented Humaneered technology platform is a method for converting existing antibodies (typically murine) into engineered, high-affinity human antibodies designed for therapeutic use, particularly with acute and chronic conditions. We have developed or in-licensed targets or research antibodies, typically from academic institutions, and then applied our Humaneered technology to produce them. Lenzilumab and our other two product candidates, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005, are Humaneered monoclonal antibodies. Our Humaneered antibodies are closer to human antibodies than chimeric or conventionally humanized antibodies and have a high affinity for their target but low immunogenicity. We believe our Humaneered antibodies offer additional advantages, such as high potency, a slow off-rate and a lower likelihood to induce an inappropriate immune response or infusion related reactions.

Scientific Rationale and Background on Lenzilumab
 
Lenzilumab neutralizes GM-CSF. The coronavirus pandemic, which has been triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and leads to the condition referred to as COVID-19, is characterized in the later and sometimes fatal stages by lung dysfunction and, in many patients, multi-organ impairment, which is triggered by Cytokine Release Syndrome (“CRS”), or cytokine storm. Publications have pointed to GM-CSF as being a signature cytokine in this process, with elevated GM-CSF levels correlated to poorer outcomes and sometimes ventilator use and Intensive Care Unit (“ICU”) admission.
 
COVID-19 has three distinct phases: early infection, pulmonary/inflammatory and hyperinflammatory. As shown on the diagram below, lenzilumab is being studied for use in patients that are in the pulmonary/inflammatory phase who are hospitalized and hypoxic.



The severe clinical features associated with some COVID-19 infections result from an inflammation-induced lung injury which may require supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or Extra Corporeal Mechanical Oxygenation (ECMO) and sometimes ICU care. This lung injury is a result of a hyperinflammatory dysregulation of the immune system and associated with cytokine storm. The lung injury that leads to death is not directly related to the virus but appears to be a result of a hyper-reactive immune response to the virus triggering a cytokine storm that can continue even after viral titers remain stable or even begin to fall. 
 
CRS is characterized by an elevation of inflammatory cytokines resulting in fever, hypotension, capillary leak syndrome, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, respiratory failure, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (“ARDS”). The development of CRS as a direct result of immune hyper-stimulation has been previously described in patients with autoimmune and lymphoproliferative diseases, as well as in patients with B-cell malignancies receiving CAR-T therapy. Over the last five years, preclinical studies and correlative science from clinical trials in CAR-T therapy have shed light on the pathophysiology, development, characterization, and management of CRS.

CRS is characterized by activation of myeloid cells and release of inflammatory cytokines, including GM-CSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 (IL-1). The cascade, once initiated, can quickly evolve into a cytokine storm, resulting in further activation, expansion and trafficking of myeloid cells, leading to abnormal endothelial activation, increased vascular permeability, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
 
Data from National Scientific Review (2020, Vol. 7, No. 6) titled “Pathogenic T-cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storms in severe COVID-19 patients”, supports the hypothesis that GM-CSF induced cytokine storm immune mechanisms have contributed to patient mortality with the current pandemic strain and, we believe, in multiple variants, of coronavirus, and there is increasing acceptance that this pathophysiology may be responsible for worsening of clinical status and poor outcomes. The authors noted that steroid treatment in such cases has been disappointing in terms of outcome but suggested that a monoclonal antibody that targets GM-CSF may prevent or curb the hyper-active immune response caused by COVID-19 in this setting. Three recent publications point to GM-CSF as a so-called ‘signature cytokine’ including the largest inflammatory marker study in over 600 patients from a multicenter study in the UK. (Uncontrolled Innate and Impaired Adaptive Immune Responses in Patients with COVID-19 ARDS, deProst et al, AJRCCM Articles in Press., American Thoracic Society, August 31, 2020, 10.1164/rccm.202005-1885OC) (The dysregulated innate immune response in severe COVID-19 pneumonia that could drive poorer outcome, Blot et al. J Transl Med (2020) 18:457) (Elevated antiviral, myeloid and endothelial inflammatory markers in severe COVID-19, Openshaw et al, MedRxIV, doi).
 
While early studies demonstrated elevated GM-CSF levels in both ICU and non-ICU treated COVID-19 patients, one of these three more recent studies showed a positive association with disease severity and outcome, in agreement with reports of elevated frequencies of GM-CSF+ Th1 cells in patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU treatment. The authors analyzed serial plasma samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recruited through the prospective multicenter ISARIC clinical characterization protocol in the UK. Elevated levels of numerous mediators including angiopoietin-2, IP-10, and GM-CSF were seen at recruitment in patients who later died. This analysis shows that, at the time of enrollment, different COVID-19 outcome groups were already identifiable and associated with distinct patterns of inflammatory mediators and that markers such as GM-CSF were particularly associated with enhanced disease severity and strikingly elevated in fatal cases of COVID-19. An influx of monocytes/macrophages has been described in the lung parenchyma in fatal COVID-19, combined with a mononuclear cell pulmonary artery vasculitis, and presence of pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe COVID-19. The elevation of GM-CSF in severe disease could contribute to monocyte recruitment and activation leading to this vasculitis, alongside the role of GM-CSF in the recruitment of neutrophils to the pulmonary vasculature.
 
A second independent study reported serum concentrations of GM-CSF were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients. In this study, increased serum concentrations of IL-8, IL-10 and GM-CSF were associated with disease severity. Strikingly, in this study the serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-1Ra and IL-8 not only showed no, or only marginally, significant differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients but were also not associated with day-28 mortality in COVID-19 patients. Further, the serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1Ra correlated with the SOFA score, indicating that these cytokines rather behave as biomarkers of organ-failure-associated hyper-inflammation, consistent with their previously reported association with patient severity and outcome in cohort studies merging patients with mild to severe disease. Interestingly, the concentrations of CCL19/MIP/3b, CCL20/MIP-3a and CCL5/RANTES, which recruit monocytes and T cells, remained stable over time. These chemokines are secreted by CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, which are enriched in the blood of COVID-19 patients with severe disease. In line with this observation, the serum concentrations of GM-CSF were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients.
 
A third independent study reported a significant correlation between the duration of mechanical ventilation (“MV”) and GM-CSF (p < 0.0001), IL-10 (p < 0.0001), IP-10 (p < 0.0001), MCP-1 (p = 0.001), CX3CL1 (p = 0.0233), and Granzyme B (p = 0.0143). Based on these results, they performed a multivariate linear regression to identify factors associated with the duration of MV in the first 30 days, using two models (i.e., SOFA score (model 1) or PaO2: FiO2 ratio (model 2) as the variable of adjustment to account for severity). Only GM-CSF was independently associated with a longer duration of MV in both models. The authors estimated an excess of 22.11 ± 8.36 min of MV per increase of 1 pg/mL of GM-CSF (p = 0.0105, model 1; and p < 0.0001, model 2).

Similar to patients receiving CAR-T therapy, the development of CRS in patients with COVID-19 has been associated with elevation of CRP, ferritin, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, as well as correlating with respiratory failure, ARDS, and adverse clinical outcomes. Most significantly, high levels of GM-CSF-secreting Th17 T-cells have been associated with disease severity, myeloid cell trafficking to the lungs, and ICU admission. This indicates that post-COVID-19 CRS is caused by a similar mechanism, induced by activation of myeloid cells and their trafficking to the lung, resulting in lung injury and ARDS. Tissue CD14+ myeloid cells produce GM-CSF and IL-6, further triggering a cytokine storm cascade. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage samples from COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS demonstrated an overwhelming infiltration of newly-arrived inflammatory myeloid cells compared to mild COVID-19 disease and healthy controls, consistent with a hyperinflammatory CRS-mediated pathology. We believe that these new data suggest that GM-CSF may be a critical triggering cytokine in the increased mortality in COVID-19. 
 
Lenzilumab has been shown to prevent cytokine storm in animal models and this work has been published in peer reviewed journals. These data demonstrate that GM-CSF neutralization results in a reduction in IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1α, IP-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) levels, demonstrating that GM-CSF is an upstream regulator of many inflammatory cytokines that are important in the pathophysiology of CRS. GM-CSF depletion results in modulation of myeloid cell behavior, a specific decrease in their inflammatory cytokines, and a reduction in tissue trafficking, while enhancing T-cell expansion and effector functions.
 
The Phase 3 program in COVID-19 is complementary to the programs in CAR-T and GvHD, which are also focused on preventing or reducing cytokine storm in those disease states. Positive results from the Phase 3 trial in COVID-19 may be predictive of results in these other settings, which are also characterized by cytokine storm.
 
As a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform prevention and treatment of CRS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-Cov-2, is one of a group of several betacoronaviruses, which includes the viruses responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). These viruses infect predominantly the lower lung and cause fatal pneumonia. Other coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory tract and cause some cases of the common cold. Initially, the clinical course of COVID-19 could be mistaken for influenza infection – patients in both cases often suffer from aches and pains throughout the body, fever, cough and general malaise. However, rapid nasal or throat swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been developed and are in widespread use. Exposure to people who are known to have suffered from the condition or carriers of SARS-CoV-2 also increases the clinical suspicion of possible infection. Data generated during the SARS and MERS outbreaks point to cytokine storm as a phase of the illness which is characterized by an immune hyperactive phase, which can progress to lung dysfunction and death. In patients who clinically deteriorate, there can be multi-system effects, including hematologic and coagulation disorders, renal, cardiovascular and neurologic impairment, some of which may further complicate respiratory compromised patients. The natural history of SARS infection shows viral load decreases as patients enter the second phase of the illness, which is often characterized by cytokine storm and the elevation of certain biomarkers.

We also believe we have the ability to transform CAR-T therapy and a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic cell transplantation. There is a direct correlation between the efficacy of CAR-T therapy and the incidence of life-threatening toxicities (referred to as the efficacy/toxicity linkage). We have begun enrolling patients in ZUMA-19, in collaboration with our partner Kite, to assess effect of the sequential therapy of lenzilumab with Yescarta, the leading CAR-T, in reducing or minimizing cytokine storm and neurotoxicity in patients receiving CAR-T, and potentially building further on Yescarta’s current category-leading efficacy. Depending on the final number of patients enrolled, this may serve as a Phase 1b/2 potential registration study.
 
We believe that our GM-CSF neutralization and gene-editing CAR-T platform technologies have the potential to reduce the inflammatory cascade associated with serious and potentially life-threatening CAR-T therapy-related side-effects while preserving and potentially improving the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy itself, thereby breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage. Clinical correlative analysis and preclinical in vivo evidence points to GM-CSF as the key initiator of the inflammatory cascade resulting in CAR-T therapy’s side-effects, including CRS and NT. GM-CSF has also been linked to the suppressive myeloid cell axis through recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (“MDSCs”) that reduce CAR-T cell expansion and hamper CAR-T cell efficacy. Our strategy is to continue to pioneer the use of GM-CSF neutralization and GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to improve efficacy and prevent or significantly reduce the serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy.

We believe that our GM-CSF pathway science, assets and expertise create two technology platforms to assist in the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies:
 

· | Lenzilumab has the potential to be used in combination with any FDA-approved or development stage T-cell therapy, including CAR-T therapy, as well as in combination with other cell therapies such as allogeneic HSCT such as bone marrow transplants, to make these treatments safer and more effective
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In addition, our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that may inherently avoid any efficacy/toxicity linkage, thereby potentially preserving the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while reducing or altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

We have utilized a precision medicine approach and personalized the development of lenzilumab based on specific genetic mutations or biomarkers at baseline. We are collaborating with IMPACT, a clinical trial partnership of 22 transplant centers in the United Kingdom, in planning a randomized, placebo controlled, Phase 2/3 study focused on early intervention with lenzilumab in patients at high risk or intermediate risk for steroid-refractory acute GvHD based on specific biomarkers.  The goal of the trial, as it is currently contemplated, would be to determine the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab in reducing non-relapse mortality at six months.
 
We have completed enrollment and reported on a Phase 1 study of lenzilumab as monotherapy in refractory chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and are planning a Phase 2 study of lenzilumab in combination with azacitidine (current standard therapy) in newly-diagnosed CMML patients with certain genetic mutations. The Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with CMML identified the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose of lenzilumab, and assessed lenzilumab’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity. The results were reported at the 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference.
 
We have also reported on a Phase 2 study with lenzilumab in severe asthma in patients uncontrolled on high-dose steroid therapy.
 
Our Pipeline
 
Our lenzilumab-based clinical-stage pipeline comprises a Phase 3 potential registration study in COVID-19 which has fully enrolled, the NIH-sponsored and funded ACTIV-5/BET program in COVID-19, a currently enrolling Phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) as sequenced therapy of lenzilumab and Yescarta, a planned Phase 2/3 study in acute GvHD, and a planned Phase 2 study in CMML, the latter two of which we expect will be majority funded by partners. While the majority of our clinical programs involve lenzilumab, we have also fully enrolled an ifabotuzumab Phase 1 study in GBM.

Except for the potential of lenzilumab for COVID-19 under an EUA, our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development and will require substantial time, resources, research and development, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Furthermore, it may be years before any of our products are approved for use, if at all. Our current pipeline is depicted below:
 


1 Phase 3 may not be necessary for approval in ZUMA-19; precedent CAR-Ts to date have been approved on Phase 2 data
 2 UK
 3 US, EU, Australia
 
Lenzilumab
 
Lenzilumab neutralizes human GM-CSF and has the potential to prevent or reduce poor outcomes associated with COVID-19. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial in the setting of COVID-19. There were 18 clinical sites across the US and 11 sites in Brazil involved in the study. This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of lenzilumab in improving ventilator-free survival in hospitalized hypoxic adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. 
 
There are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CRS/cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. There are numerous products currently in development for COVID-19 which can be broadly categorized as direct acting antivirals, immunomodulators, anticoagulants and other preventative strategies such as vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Remdesivir (a direct acting antiviral) was approved by FDA for COVID-19. There is no evidence that remdesivir offers a mortality benefit and the largest remdesivir-based global study conducted by the World Health Organization failed to show benefit from remdesivir treatment. Other direct acting antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (with or without a macrolide) have not demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Other treatments available under EUA include baricitinib (Olumiant) in combination with remdesivir (Veklury), bamlanivimab alone and with Etesevimab, and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab). Published data to date from randomized controlled clinical trials in the setting of COVID-19 and the two leading IL-6 inhibitors, Actemra (tocilizumab) and Kevzara (sarilumab) has been mixed. Recently published results from the The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial has demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory treatment, tocilizumab, reduces the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.
 
This is an open label study. The study also showed that tocilizumab shortens the time until patients are successfully discharged from hospital and reduces the need for a mechanical ventilator. The relative reduction in mortality was 14% and the relative reduction in progressing to IMV or death was 15%. A total of 2,022 patients were randomly allocated to receive tocilizumab by intravenous infusion and were compared with 2,094 patients randomly allocated to usual care alone. 82% of patients were taking a systemic steroid such as dexamethasone. Treatment with tocilizumab significantly reduced deaths: 596 (29%) of the patients in the tocilizumab group died within 28 days compared with 694 (33%) patients in the usual care group (rate ratio 0·86; [95% confidence interval [CI] 0·77 to 0·96]; p=0·007), a 14% relative risk reduction and an absolute difference of 4%. Tocilizumab also increased the probability of discharge alive within 28 days from 47% to 54% (rate ratio 1·23, [95% CI 1·12 to 1·34], p<0·0001). These benefits were seen in all patient subgroups, including those requiring oxygen via a simple face mask through to those requiring mechanical ventilators in an intensive care unit. Among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation when entered into the trial, tocilizumab significantly reduced the chance of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death from 38% to 33% (risk ratio 0·85, [95% CI 0·78 to 0·93], p=0·0005) a 15% relative risk reduction. However, there was no evidence that tocilizumab had any effect on the chance of successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation. In June 2020, the RECOVERY trial found that the inexpensive and widely available steroid dexamethasone reduces death for patients with severe COVID-19. Dexamethasone became part of standard-of-care given to all such patients. In this trial, the benefits of tocilizumab were seen to be in addition to those of steroids.

In addition, IL-1 and IL-1 receptor inhibitors, respectively Ilaris (canakinumab) and Kineret (anakinra) have both failed to demonstrate benefit in Phase 3 studies, as has the oral JAK inhibitor Jakafi (ruxolitinib) and the BTK inhibitor Calquence (acalabrutinib). The anti-GM-CSF agent, otilimab failed in an 806-patient randomized controlled study sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”). In a post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients older than 70, there was an apparent benefit in the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28 and mortality at day 60. A 350-patient follow-on Phase 3 study is planned to determine if the benefit in the patients older than 70 can be confirmed. It is unclear whether the anti-GM-CSF agents, gimsilumab and namilumab are continuing development for COVID-19 and the primary endpoint for mavrilimumab for COVID-19 in a 40-patient study was recently missed, though there were some promising data in this small Phase 2 study.
 
As an upstream regulator of cytokine storm, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab may offer advantages over other immunomodulator strategies that either target other downstream cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, CCR5 or MIP-1a or are broadly immunosuppressive and target cytokine signaling pathways non-selectively through JAK inhibition. In addition, lenzilumab is the only immunomodulator that was in an active clinical trial to prevent cytokine storm prior to COVID-19 and is currently the only agent in an active Phase 3 trial targeting GM-CSF, with other such agents in earlier stage studies.
 
During 2020, we achieved several significant milestones relating to lenzilumab. In April 2020 lenzilumab was granted emergency single use IND authorization from the FDA (often referred to as compassionate use) to treat patients with COVID-19. On June 15, 2020, we announced that Mayo Clinic published data derived from the compassionate use of lenzilumab in the treatment of 12 patients hospitalized in the Mayo Clinic system. Under applicable FDA rules, a patient cannot receive a compassionate use drug unless FDA has issued an individual patient emergency IND authorization, which the Mayo Clinic requested and received from FDA prior to each individual patient dosing of lenzilumab. Accordingly, there was no randomized control group in the Mayo Clinic program. We did not pre-select patients to receive lenzilumab through the compassionate use program and did not deny any requests for compassionate use. Mayo Clinic clinicians solely determined which patients for which they would request emergency IND authorization from the FDA. As discussed below the results of the compassionate use lenzilumab compared to the contemporaneous control group were recently published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
 
The patients receiving lenzilumab were hospitalized, required oxygen supplementation (hypoxic) as a result of COVID-19 but did not include any patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. They were also viewed as being at high risk of further disease progression. All patients had elevation in at least one inflammatory biomarker prior to receiving lenzilumab. All patients had at least one co-morbidity associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 and several patients had multiple co-morbidities.
 
On September 1, 2020, we announced that Mayo Clinic Proceedings, a premier peer-reviewed journal, had published a manuscript reporting the first case-cohort data of lenzilumab in COVID-19 patients. Control patients were identified from an electronic registry of COVID-19 patients in the same centers as cases and matched for age, sex, disease severity, and baseline oxygen requirements. At the time of selection, the clinical outcomes for the matched control patients were not known.

The study involved a total of 39 patients, 12 treated with lenzilumab, and 27 contemporaneous matched control patients who received standard of care treatment. Lenzilumab treatment was associated with an 80% relative reduction in risk of progression to IMV and/or death compared to matched controls (8% vs. 41%, p=0.07). Median time to a 2-point clinical improvement on the 8-point hospital ordinal scale was five days versus 11 days in the control arm (p=0.006). Ventilator-free survival favored lenzilumab versus controls (p=0.06). Median time to resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was one day in the lenzilumab treatment arm versus eight days in the control group (p<0.001). Mean SpO2/FiO2 ratios post-therapy were significantly improved in the lenzilumab patients versus controls (p<0.001). Patients treated with lenzilumab were discharged in a median of five days versus 11 days in the control arm (p=0.008).
 
Lenzilumab treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in the inflammatory marker CRP relative to the control group (p=0.01) and an improvement in lymphocyte counts relative to the control group (p=0.04). There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab.
 
The data from the case-control study suggest that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab may have an effect through a dual mechanism of action to restore balance to dysregulated immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 by suppressing myeloid inflammatory response and improving T-cell counts thought to be responsible for viral clearance.

On October 29, 2020, we announced that National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”), a part of National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) as represented by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (“DMID”), and Humanigen enrolled the first patient in the NIAID-sponsored ACTIV-5/Big Effect Trial (“BET”) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. BET will help advance NIAID’s strategic plan for COVID-19 research, which includes conducting studies to advance high-priority therapeutic candidates. Identification of agents with novel mechanisms of action for therapy is a strategic priority.
 
ACTIV-5 will evaluate the combination of lenzilumab and remdesivir on treatment outcomes versus placebo and remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The trial is expected to enroll 100 patients in each arm of the study with an interim analysis for efficacy after 50 patients have been enrolled in each arm. With data from ACTIV-5 and our ongoing Phase 3 study, we expect to have data from more than 700 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in the aggregate.
 
Lenzilumab also has the potential to prevent or reduce serious and sometime fatal side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy (CRS and neurotoxicity), a cancer therapy; See “--CAR-T Overview” later in this Item 1 for a fuller description of the therapy. Preclinical data generated in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic (the “Mayo Clinic”), which was published in ‘blood®’, a premier journal in hematology, indicates that the use of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy may also enhance the proliferation and improve the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This may also result in durable, or longer term, responses in CAR-T therapies. There are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CAR-T therapy-related side effects, nor are there any approved therapies for the treatment of CAR-T therapy related NT.
 
We are advancing the development of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy through a non-exclusive clinical collaboration with Kite, pursuant to which we are conducting a multi-center potential registration Phase 1b/2 study of lenzilumab with Kite’s Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, including DLBCL (the “Study”). The Study has been designated the nomenclature ‘ZUMA-19’, consistent with the other Kite CAR-T studies, which also receive a ‘ZUMA’ designation, including ZUMA-1, the study that served as the registrational study for Yescarta. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety and efficacy of Yescarta. Kite’s Yescarta is one of four CAR-T therapies that have been approved by the FDA and is the CAR-T therapy market leader. Our collaboration with Kite is currently the only clinical collaboration which is now enrolling patients with the potential to improve both the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy, including in 5 centers that were participants in ZUMA-1. We also plan to measure other potentially beneficial effects on efficacy and healthcare resource utilization. In addition, lenzilumab’s success in preventing serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects could offer economic benefits to medical system payers by making the CAR-T therapy capable of being administered, and follow-up care subsequently monitored and managed, potentially on an out-patient basis in certain patients and circumstances. In turn, we believe that delivering such provider and payer benefits might accelerate the use of the CAR-T therapy itself, and thereby permit us to generate further revenues from sales of lenzilumab.

In addition to COVID-19 and CAR-T therapy, we are committed to advancing our diverse platform for GM-CSF axis suppression for a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic next generation CAR-T therapies, bi-specific antibody therapies, as well as other cell-based immunotherapies in development, including allogeneic HSCT, with our current and future partners.
 
In July 2019, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement (the “Zurich Agreement”) with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent or treat GvHD a serious and potentially fatal condition associated with transplantation, thereby expanding our development platform to include improving the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT, a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. We believe that cytokine storm may be responsible, at least in part, for the emergence of GvHD in this setting. There are currently no FDA-approved agents for the prevention of GvHD nor treatment of GvHD in patients identified as high risk by certain biomarkers. We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or treat GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. Several recent papers have been published which support this approach, including in Science Translational Medicine in November 2018 and in ‘blood advances’ in October 2019.
 
We aim to position lenzilumab as a necessary companion product to any allogeneic HSCT and as a part of the standard pre-conditioning that all patients receiving allogeneic HSCT should receive or as an early treatment option in patients identified as high risk for GvHD.
 
Given our interest in developing lenzilumab to prevent CRS/cytokine storm in COVID-19 as well as in the treatment of rare cancers and other orphan conditions such as GvHD, we believe that we have the opportunity to benefit from various regulatory incentives, such as coronavirus treatment acceleration program (CTAP), orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval.
 
GM-CSF Gene Knockout
 
We are advancing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform through an exclusive worldwide license agreement (the “Mayo Agreement”) that we entered into in June 2019 with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (the “Mayo Foundation”). Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools, including CRISPR-Cas9. We believe that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy. In addition, we have and continue to file intellectual property encompassing a broad range of gene-editing approaches related to GM-CSF knockout.
 
Preclinical data indicates that GM-CSF gene knockout CAR-T cells show improved overall survival in animals compared to wild-type CAR-T cells in addition to the expected benefits of reduced serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. We are establishing a platform of next-generation combinatorial gene knockout CAR-T cells that have potential to be applied across both autologous and allogeneic approaches and we are also investigating multiple CAR-T cell designs using precise dual and triple gene editing to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity while simultaneously preventing CAR-T therapy induced toxicities. Through targeted gene expression and modulating cytokine activation signaling, we may be able to increase the proportion of fitter T-cells produced during expansion, increase their proliferative potential, and inhibit activation-induced cell death, thereby improving the cancer killing activity of our engineered CAR-T cells thereby making them more effective and safer in the treatment of cancers. Initial data were published in an abstract that was presented at the December 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting and also won an ASH Abstract Achievement award.

We plan to continue development of this technology in combination approaches that could add to the observed efficacy benefits of current generation CAR-T products. In addition, we anticipate that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform may be a future backbone for controlling the serious side-effects that hamper CAR-T therapy that lead to serious and sometimes fatal outcomes for patients as a result of the CAR-T therapy itself.
 
CAR-T Overview 
 
As of the date of this filing, four CAR-T therapies that have been approved by the FDA, Gilead/Kite’s Yescarta, and Tecartus, Novartis’s Kymriah and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel), seek to treat forms of B-cell cancers such as various types of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (“NHL”), including DLBCL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (“MCL”) that are refractory or in second or later stage relapse. Although patients suffering from these aggressive cancers frequently undergo multiple treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapy including stem cell transplants, the five-year survival rate has been severely limited and patients who do not respond to, or have relapsed following at least two courses of standard treatment, have no other treatment options and a very poor outcome. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (“SEER”) program of the National Cancer Institute, which is a source of epidemiologic information on the incidence and survival rates of cancer in the U.S., it is estimated that up to 10,000 patients per year in the U.S. with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell NHL and ALL who have failed at least two prior systemic therapies may be eligible for CAR-T therapy. In addition, if CAR-T therapy is approved as an earlier second line option versus stem cell transplantation, an additional 10,000 to 12,000 patients may be eligible for treatment. However, this is predicated on improving the benefit-to-risk profile of CAR-T therapy, addressing the severe life-threatening adverse events currently associated with these agents and breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage.
 
The FDA-approved CAR-T therapies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using targeted immuno-cellular engineering to cause a patient’s own T-cells to fight certain cancers that have not responded to standard therapies. T-cells are often called the “workhorses” of the immune system because of their role in coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected by pathogens and cancer cells. As depicted below, each of the FDA-approved CAR-T therapies is currently a one-time treatment that involves multiple steps:
 

· | Harvesting white blood cells from the patient’s blood, also known as apheresis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Engineering T-cells within this population to express cancer-specific receptors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing and purifying the number of genetically re-engineered T-cells; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Infusing the functional cancer-specific T-cells back into the patient to allow for expansion and targeting the cancer cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kymriah, Yescarta and Tecartus each received FDA approval for adults with r/r DLBCL on the basis of one pivotal, single-arm Phase 2 study (ZUMA-1, in the case of Yescarta, and ZUMA-2, in the case of Tecartus) which served as the pivotal registration trial for each product in this indication, a markedly accelerated process that indicates the FDA’s view of the strong potential of these novel CAR-T therapy treatments to address an unmet need and improve patient outcomes. The number of evaluable patients in the studies that led to FDA approval for Kymriah, Yescarta and Tecartus in large B-cell lymphoma was 68, 101 and 68 respectively. Moreover, Kymriah also received FDA approval for the treatment of pediatrics and adolescents with relapsed refractory (“r/r”) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) based on a single phase 2 study. In the Kymriah registration study in the DLBCL population, 160 patients were enrolled and 68 were evaluable.
 
ZUMA-1, the single Phase 2 study that led to the FDA approval of Yescarta in r/r DLBCL, showed similarly positive results. The study enrolled 111 patients (101 were evaluable) with large B-cell lymphoma at advanced stages despite having undergone at least two previous treatments, with approximately 20% of patients already having undergone a stem cell transplant. The CR rate within three months of CAR-T treatment, given as a single infusion, was 58%, which dropped to 46% after six months. The CR rate after two years of CAR-T treatment, given as a single infusion, has been reported as 37%.
 
ZUMA-2, a single-arm, open-label Phase 2 study that led to the FDA approval of Tecartus for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), enrolled a total of 74 patients (68 were evaluable) that had received BTK inhibitor therapy previously. In an intention-to-treat analysis of all 74 patients enrolled, 85% of patients were reported to have had an objective response, and 59% had a complete response (https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1914347)

The FDA approval of Breyanzi is based on data from the TRANSCEND NHL 001 (017001) trial in which 268 patients with R/R LBCL received Breyanzi, the largest pivotal trial in third-line plus R/R LBCL that included patients with a broad range of histologies and high-risk disease. In the trial, Breyanzi was administered in the inpatient and outpatient settings.
 
Encouraged by the success of the Phase 2 studies, since the initial FDA approvals were granted to Novartis for Kymriah, the CAR-T therapy market has seen rapid expansion, with Gilead/Kite and Novartis and scores of other biotechnology companies actively working to progress CAR-T therapies as potential treatments for numerous blood and solid tumor cancers. The fourth entrant to the US market, Brevanzi from BMS has been recently approved. 
 
Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus and Brevanzi are autologous individualized CD19 targeted CAR-T therapies. Development is also ongoing to move each agent to earlier lines of therapy for DLBCL (rather than as salvage therapy for patients who have exhausted other options), in other types of B-cell NHL and for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”). According to SEER, as well as the American Cancer Society's Cancer Statistics Center and World Health Organization Union for International Cancer Control, it is estimated that up to 10,000 patients with r/r B-cell hematologic malignancies (including DLBCL, ALL, CLL) per year may potentially benefit from CD19 targeted CAR-T therapies. In addition, if CAR-T therapy is approved as an earlier second-line option versus stem cell transplantation, an additional 10,000 to 12,000 patients may be eligible for treatment. Moreover, there are two B-cell maturation antigen (“BCMA”) targeted CAR-T therapies in phase 2 development for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and several other novel CAR-T therapies targeting various antigens and neo-antigens in development for a number of hematologic and solid cancers. While there may be individual differences between CAR-T therapy products, the overall toxicity profile is generally expected to be generally consistent with that reported for Yescarta, Tescarta and for Kymriah and it is known that various development-stage BCMA and other CAR-T therapies are hampered by the emergence of cytokine storm and other serious and potentially fatal side-effects.
 
CAR-T Therapy
 
The four FDA-approved CAR-T therapies are not without significant limitations. Despite the exciting prospects for treating patients with limited options, significant and potentially life-threatening side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy, including NT and CRS, remain a significant unmet need that must be addressed. Because NT and CRS can be life-threatening and have proven fatal in many instances, and because each product bears a “Boxed” warning from the FDA (the strictest FDA warning label intended to alert patients and providers about serious and life-threatening risks associated with a particular drug), patients seeking to benefit from Yescarta, Tescartus, Kymriah or Brevanzi generally may only do so if the treatment center is in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) program required by FDA. 
 
REMS is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain medications with serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks and are intended to assist and train certified treatment centers on the management of these serious side-effects. For example, each hospital and its associated clinics have a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab available on-site for each patient for the potential treatment of moderate to severe cases of CRS. We believe the REMS requirement may have adversely impacted both market uptake and usage to date. Both CRS and NT are caused by a large-scale release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by the CAR-T therapy, sometimes referred to as a “cytokine storm”. The first placebo-controlled, randomized study evaluating tocilizumab for the treatment of cytokine storm, in this case in COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm, failed to demonstrate an effect. However, the Recovery study, an open-label, randomized trial conducted in the UK demonstrated an improvement in mortality (HR=.86, 14% relative risk reduction) and an improvement in progression to IMV and/or death (HR=.85, 15% relative risk reduction).
 
According to the package inserts for Yescarta and Kymriah, up to 94% of patients treated with Yescarta or Kymriah in the clinical trial setting experienced CRS (with up to 49% of cases being severe or grade >3 in nature) and up to 87% experienced NT (with up to 31% of cases being severe or grade >3 in nature) despite the availability and utilization of tocilizumab. Moreover, based on feedback from leading treatment centers in the US, approximately 30 to 60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy require admission to the ICU and in some cases require an extended stay, with multiple interventions, including ventilator support and other supportive measures, to be urgently administered to manage these side-effects. Some patients can suffer seizures, coma, brain swelling, heart arrhythmias, organ failure and serious and life-threatening clotting disorders, not only causing more complex and potentially fatal medical consequences, but significantly adding to cost of patient care. These can be particularly challenging and concerning issues, especially in younger and pediatric patients.

It is important to note that patients suffering from severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia can often suffer similar medical conditions and extended hospitalization and ICU care.
 
Researchers who evaluated 1,254 patients who underwent CAR-T therapy at 86 hospitals over the past two years reported that the median ICU stay was 15 to 19 days with a median overall cost ranging from $85,726 to $242,730, not including the cost of the CAR-T therapy itself (Harris, et al. TCT 2019 Abstracts 500, 501). In addition, there have also been deaths reported as a result of these serious side-effects. A publication assessing 636 patients who had received either of the two FDA-approved CAR-T therapies (348 patients on Yescarta and 288 on Kymriah) authored by Anand and Burns, et al. in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (37, 2019 (suppl; abstract 2540)) reported that 15% of CAR-T treated patients (10% receiving Yescarta and 21% receiving Kymriah) died from factors not associated with disease progression (i.e., non-relapse mortality) and the primary driver of non-relapse mortality was NT and/or CRS. Therefore, these serious side-effects are associated with significant mortality rates, despite the availability of approved supportive care measures, even as CAR-T therapies are administered only in trained and certified treatment centers staffed by experts in the field. If such side-effects can be ameliorated or eradicated, and adequate data is submitted to FDA, the “Black Box” warning and REMS program could potentially be scaled back or removed. Further, this may allow a larger proportion of patients to receive CAR-T administration in the out-patient setting. This could convey significant medical and financial benefits and also change the reimbursement dynamic in favor of providers, while opening up a larger cohort of potentially suitable patients.
 
There are currently no FDA-approved products for the prevention or treatment of NT or for the prevention of CRS associated with CAR-T therapy. Medicines used to manage NT and CRS, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, have not adequately controlled the side-effects, and steroids may have a detrimental impact on the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy itself while tocilizumab may increase the risk of CAR-T therapy induced NT and is correlated with an increased risk of infections, including severe infections. Further, these medicines have not undergone prospective clinical trials for use in this patient population. Tocilizumab is only approved for the treatment of severe cases of CRS, but is not approved for prevention of CRS, nor is it approved for either prevention or treatment of NT. 
 
The approval of tocilizumab in CRS was granted as a result of case studies and not as a result of a planned, prospective clinical study in this patient population, as would be typical. Studies testing tocilizumab for the prevention of CRS have shown tocilizumab to significantly worsen the rate of NT across all grades as well as the more serious grades 3 and above, as compared to the rate in patients who did not receive tocilizumab prophylactically. In addition, recent publications question the efficacy of tocilizumab in CRS. For example, studies testing tocilizumab as a prophylactic therapy for CRS have shown the rates of overall CRS remained unaltered as compared to the rate in patients who did not receive tocilizumab prophylactically (Locke et al. American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) 2017, Abstract 1547). Further, a publication authored by Le, et al. in The Oncologist (2018, 28(8); 943-947) assessing 60 patients who had received either Yescarta or Kymriah and had suffered from CRS having received tocilizumab and/or steroids after the onset of CRS, reported that only approximately half of the patients responded at day 11. 
 
These data, along with the Anand/Burns data and the Locke data discussed above, demonstrate that improvements in the ability to prevent or mitigate NT and CRS are needed. Such improvements would help remove these major impediments to uptake and utility of CAR-T therapies, improve healthcare utilization and improve overall patient outcomes. Managing patients with these side-effects can consume a significant amount of in-hospital resources, including extended stays in the ICU. The primary driver of non-drug related costs associated with CAR-T therapy is the length of stay in the hospital, particularly if this includes ICU admission. Non-drug related costs for patients who develop CRS and/or NT are approximately double that of patients who do not develop these serious toxicities. Further, as the potential benefit of CAR-T therapies are explored in earlier lines of hematologic cancers (rather than as salvage therapy for patients who have exhausted other options), as well as moving use of CAR-T therapies into solid tumors, the need to address serious side-effects becomes paramount.

In addition to improving patient outcomes, the ability to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of NT and prevent CRS associated with CAR-T therapy may offer significant benefits in making these treatments more cost-effective. Hospital reimbursement for patients who are treated only as an out-patient is profoundly different from, and more favorable to the hospital than, the reimbursement afforded to treatments for patients who are admitted or re-admitted to the hospital within a 72-hour period. Unfortunately, at present, the need to identify, treat and manage NT and CRS generally has prevented CAR-T therapies from being administered, and follow-up care monitored and managed, on an out-patient basis. Again, 30-60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy require admission to the ICU, in some cases requiring an extended stay, with multiple interventions, investigations and treatments needing to be urgently administered.  As a result, in some institutions, the treating physician may require the hospital to reserve a bed in the ICU as a prerequisite to administering the CAR-T therapy in case the patient needs to be hospitalized in an attempt to manage the adverse effects from NT and CRS. This is especially challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where many ICU units are already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. At other institutions, the patient is admitted as an in-patient and is required to remain in the hospital for at least a week, with discharge being subject to satisfactory short-term outcomes and no emergence of complications. Even in institutions where the CAR-T therapy is initially administered in an out-patient setting, the patient is closely monitored daily for several weeks and is required to stay within a short distance from the hospital in case the patient needs to be admitted to the hospital on an emergency basis, requiring additional lodging, food and other costs to be incurred by the patient, the payer, or both. In some situations, these patients are re-admitted to the hospital on an emergency basis as an in-patient if complications ensue. If a patient is admitted or re-admitted to the hospital as an in-patient, the hospital reimbursement dynamics may change in a manner which is negative for the hospital, the payer and the patient. This dynamic also changes typical hospital reimbursement, depending on when in the treatment cycle the patient is admitted or re-admitted. In addition, certain treatment centers do not accept patients who are not potentially able to be treated as an out-patient and refer such patients to other centers who may be willing to treat them as in-patients, primarily as a result of the reimbursement handicap that would accrue as a result of in-patient coding, billing and reimbursement, which generally leads to the hospital system losing money because of the in-patient care reimbursement. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed further stress on the hospital, ICU and broader healthcare systems of almost all countries affected by the outbreak. 
 
While both Kymriah and Yescarta have been approved by European regulators for market authorization, prescriptions have been limited as Kite and Novartis work to establish reimbursement arrangements intended to facilitate access to the treatments on a discounted basis consistent with the governmental mandates to curb healthcare spending. These dynamics, and the additional complexity of treating patients with serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects in the hospital and/or ICU, mean that enabling true out-patient administration and follow-up would confer significant benefits to patients, payers and the hospital system. Lenzilumab, if proven to be able to abrogate these serious side-effects as well as improve efficacy, may offer a solution.
 
Other T-cell Engaging Therapies
 
In addition to CAR-T therapy, we are committed to advancing our diverse platform for GM-CSF axis suppression for a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic next generation CAR-T therapies, bi-specific antibody therapies, as well as other cell-based immunotherapies in development, to break the efficacy/toxicity linkage, including for the prevention and/or treatment of GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Many of these treatment options may lead to serious side-effects and have ample room for improved efficacy.
 
We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or reduce GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. Allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. Although a potentially life-saving treatment for patients suffering from hematological cancers, between 40-60% of patients receiving HSCT treatments experience acute or chronic GvHD, which together carries a 50% mortality rate. After being transplanted into the patient, donor-derived T cells are responsible for mediating the beneficial GvL effect. In many cases, however, donor-derived T cells that remain within the graft itself have also been linked to destruction of healthy tissue in the patient (the host), with particular risk of destroying cells in the patient’s skin, gut, and liver, resulting in GvHD. Although depleting donor grafts of T cells can prevent or reduce the risk of GvHD, this results in a reduced GvL effect, thereby having a detrimental impact on the efficacy of the allogeneic HSCT treatment itself and leading to increased relapse rates. We expect that the use of allogeneic HSCT may be hampered by GvHD complications. A recent study published in ‘blood advances’ an official journal of the American Society of Hematology, suggests that neutralizing or blocking GM-CSF may limit or prevent GvHD in the gastrointestinal tract (Gartlan, K., et al, October 8, 2019, vol. 3, no.19).

There are currently no FDA-approved agents for the prevention of GvHD, and there is a significant unmet medical need for an agent that can uncouple the beneficial GvL effect from harmful GvHD. At this time, pre-conditioning regimens for HSCT treatments vary significantly by treatment centers, including by unapproved, or “off-label”, use of agents that have been approved by the FDA for other uses only. We believe there to be a significant unmet medical need and lenzilumab, if proven to be able to prevent GvHD in allogeneic HSCTs, may offer a solution.
 
Allogeneic HSCT Overview
 
Allogeneic HSCT, which involves transferring stem cells from a healthy donor to the patient, has demonstrated effectiveness in treating hematological cancers. As depicted below, allogeneic HSCT involves multiple steps:
 

· | Collecting blood from a healthy donor;
--+---------------------------------------


· | Processing the donor’s blood to remove the stem cells before returning the rest of the donor’s blood back to the donor;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pre-conditioning the patient with high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Infusing the donor’s stem cells into the patient to allow for the production of new blood cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The overall number of allogeneic HSCT treatments continues to increase annually in the US and abroad. In 2019, approximately 10,000 allogeneic HSCT treatments are expected to be performed in the US, with similar trends expected in Europe. 
 
Combining CAR-T Therapies with Lenzilumab 
 
We believe lenzilumab has the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapy and that the use of lenzilumab may minimize or eradicate the incidence, frequency, duration and/or severity of NT and/or CRS that frequently appear in CAR-T patients. Further, GM-CSF neutralization may enhance CAR-T proliferation and effector functions and potentially confer additional benefits in terms of durable efficacy and healthcare resource utilization.
 
We also believe lenzilumab may improve the value proposition of CAR-T and allogeneic HSCT therapies and facilitate their use and acceptance throughout the healthcare systems in the US and abroad.
 
Our current clinical and regulatory development plan in marketed CAR-T therapies is focused on a collaboration agreement we executed with Kite in May 2019 (the “Kite Agreement”), with Kite marketing two of only four approved CAR-T therapies (Yescarta) is the market leader by a large margin. Pursuant to the Kite Agreement, the parties have agreed to conduct a multi-center Phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) of lenzilumab with Kite’s Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta. In addition, efficacy and healthcare resource utilization will be assessed. The Kite Agreement is non-exclusive. Depending upon FDA feedback, we believe ZUMA-19 may serve as the basis for registration for lenzilumab. On June 30, 2020, we announced that the first patient had been infused in the ZUMA-19 study.

Combining Allogeneic HSCT with Lenzilumab
 
In addition to CAR-T therapy, we are committed to advancing our diverse platform for GM-CSF axis suppression for a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic next generation CAR-T therapies, bi-specific antibody therapies as well as other cell-based immunotherapies in development, with our current and future partners.
 
We believe that GM-CSF neutralization using lenzilumab has the potential to make allogeneic HSCT safer and more effective. Similar to GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage with CAR-T therapy, GM-CSF neutralization has demonstrated potential to attenuate GvHD while maintaining the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.
 
In July 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent or treat GvHD, thereby expanding our development platform to include improving the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT, a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. The technology was recently featured in a November 2018 research article published in Science Translational Medicine, where the authors demonstrated in a murine model of GvHD, that donor T cell-derived GM-CSF drives GvHD through activation, expansion, and trafficking of myeloid cells but has no effect on the GvL response. Neutralization of GM-CSF (either using a neutralizing antibody or through GM-CSF gene knock-out) was able to uncouple the myeloid-mediated immunopathology resulting in GvHD from the T cell-mediated control of leukemic cells. This discovery provides a clear mechanistic proof-of-concept for neutralizing GM-CSF to prevent GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Corroborating data related to the critical effect GM-CSF has on GvHD development in HSCT was published recently by Gartlan et al.
 
The strong link between T cell-mediated efficacy and myeloid cell mediated toxicity mirrors the findings that have been reported with CAR-T therapies where T cell-produced GM-CSF has emerged as a key driver of the myeloid inflammatory cascade resulting in NT and CRS and potentially impairing improved CAR-T therapy efficacy through effects on myeloid-derived suppressor cells. GM-CSF neutralization has the potential to eliminate or reduce the off-target inflammatory cascade while preserving the on-target efficacy of T cell therapies, thereby breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage.
 
We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or treat GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. Accordingly, we aim to position lenzilumab as a “must have” companion product to any allogeneic HSCT and as a part of the standard pre-conditioning that all patients receiving allogeneic HSCT should receive or as an early treatment option in patients identified as high risk for GvHD.
 
Lenzilumab in CMML 
 
We believe that lenzilumab also holds promise in CMML, a rare form of hematologic cancer with no FDA-approved treatment options and a three-year overall survival rate of 20% and median overall survival of 20 months, and potentially in JMML, a rare pediatric form of leukemia. CMML is a clonal stem cell disorder of which monocytosis is a key feature. Approximately 40% of CMML patients carry NRAS/KRAS/CBL mutations which are associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity. CMML has features of myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”), including abnormal, dysplastic bone marrow cells; cytopenia; transfusion dependence; and of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including overproduction of white blood cells, organomegaly (e.g., splenomegaly and hepatomegaly) and extramedullary disease. About 15 to 20% of CMML cases progress to acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 1,100 individuals in the United States are newly diagnosed annually with CMML, with the majority of these new patients being age 60 or older. These patients are typically unsuitable for stem cell transplants.

In a Phase 1 study, 3 of 6 patients with NRAS/KRAS/CBL mutations demonstrated a clinical response by the MDS/MPN International Working Group criteria. Final results of this study were presented at the 2019 ASH annual meeting and published in ‘blood’. Building on this successful Phase 1 study in CMML with lenzilumab, we are planning a Phase 2 study in combination with azacitidine in newly-diagnosed CMML patients who express NRAS/KRAS/CBL mutations which are known to be hypersensitive to GM-CSF and therefore may lend themselves to responsiveness to lenzilumab treatment. The Phase 2 study will be conducted by Dr Daniel Thomas, MBBS PhD FRACP FRCPA B Med Sci (Hons) Associate Professor, South Australia Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), University of Adelaide in Australia and supported with a grant from the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF).
 

Gene-edited CAR-T Therapies using GM-CSF Gene Knockout
 
We believe that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy via gene-edited CAR-T cells which can be engineered to lack the ability to produce GM-CSF, thereby avoiding any efficacy/toxicity linkage and potentially preserving and improving upon the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.
 
We are advancing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform through the Mayo Agreement that we entered into in June 2019 with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools including CRISPR-Cas9. The Mayo Agreement broadened our leadership position in the GM-CSF neutralization space and expanded our discovery platform aimed at improving CAR-T therapy to include gene-edited CAR-T cells.
 
Preclinical data indicates that GM-CSF gene knockout CAR-T cells show improved overall survival compared to GM-CSF-expressing CAR-T cells in addition to the expected benefits of reduced serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. We are establishing a platform of next-generation combinatorial gene knockout CAR-T cells that have potential to be applied across both autologous and allogeneic approaches and we are also investigating multiple CAR-T cell designs using precise dual and triple gene editing to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity while simultaneously preventing CAR-T therapy induced toxicities. Through targeted gene expression and modulating cytokine activation signaling, we may be able to increase the proportion of fitter T-cells produced during expansion, increase the proliferative potential, and inhibit activation induced cell death, thereby improving the cancer killing activity of our engineered CAR-T cells thereby making them more effective and safer in the treatment of cancers. Preclinical data indicates that CAR-T cells express GM-CSF and signal through GM-CSF receptors upon activation in an autocrine fashion. GM-CSF knockout CAR-T cells are not able to signal through this pathway which results in a gene expression profile distinct from GM-CSF-expressing CAR-T cells after in vitro expansion. This includes lower levels of Fas expression which may indicate a less differentiated state of the CAR-T cells. These data were presented at the 2019 ASH annual meeting and the abstract was the recipient of an Abstract Achievement Award. We continue to explore the phenotypic pattern of GM-CSF knockout CAR-T cells relative to GM-CSF-expressing CAR-T cells and possible implications for improved safety and efficacy. We plan to continue development of this technology in combination approaches that could add to the observed efficacy benefits of current generation CAR-T products.
 
Kite Collaboration
 
Our current clinical and regulatory development plan is focused on the Kite Agreement we executed in May 2019. Pursuant to the Kite Agreement, the parties have agreed to conduct a multi-center potential registration Phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) of lenzilumab with Kite’s Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, including DLBCL. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta. In addition, efficacy and healthcare resource utilization will be assessed. Kite is the sponsor of ZUMA-19 and responsible for its conduct. On June 30, 2020, we announced that the first patient had been infused in the ZUMA-19 study.

The Kite Agreement provides that we and Kite will split only the out-of-pocket costs incurred in conducting the ZUMA-19 study, including third-party expenses incurred in accordance with a mutually agreed budget. We currently project we will be responsible for an aggregate of up to approximately $8 million in out-of-pocket costs, assuming up to a total of 72 patients are recruited for a multi-center study. Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with the Study.
 
In addition, the parties have agreed to enter into certain additional agreements in connection with ZUMA-19, including a quality and a supply agreement that will obligate us, at our expense, to supply certain quantities of lenzilumab in final form for administration to subjects in ZUMA-19. Kite is responsible, at its expense, to supply Yescarta. Kite will be responsible for other costs related to ZUMA-19. 
 
The parties have formed a Joint Development Committee (“JDC”) to oversee ZUMA-19, its progress and administration, and other matters between the parties and their obligations set forth in the Kite Agreement. The JDC comprises representatives of each of Humanigen and Kite. Kite’s JDC designees will have decision-making authority with respect to (1) certain operational matters in conducting ZUMA-19, such as selection of participating sites and engagement of third party service providers; and (2) amendments to the ZUMA-19 protocol established by the JDC that do not directly relate to our investigational product or the part of the ZUMA-19 Study combination that consists solely of our investigational product; but only, in each case, to the extent that such decisions by the Kite JDC designees do not result in an increase in the mutually agreed-upon budget by fifteen percent or more. Neither Kite designees nor our designees will have final decision-making authority on matters directly related to the investigational product of the other party, including the other party’s investigational product that is used in or a part of ZUMA-19.
 
We and Kite will jointly own all ZUMA-19 data and sample data, including case report forms, findings, conclusions and other results from ZUMA-19 that relates to each party’s investigational product that is used in combination or sequence in ZUMA-19, and not solely to either party’s investigational product. ZUMA-19 data and sample data that relates solely to a party’s own investigational product will be owned solely by that party. We and Kite will own our respective background intellectual property and neither party has been granted a commercial license to use the respective background intellectual property of the other party. Each party will own any inventions that relate to its own investigational product used in ZUMA-19 or sample data, however, any new inventions related to, or covering, the combination of each party’s investigational product used in ZUMA-19 will be jointly owned by the parties. Kite will control any preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of any patent covering any new inventions related to, or covering, the combination of each party’s investigational product used in ZUMA-19 and the parties will equally share costs for all such patents. We will continue to own all world-wide rights to lenzilumab and the intellectual property related to lenzilumab, including use of lenzilumab with CAR-T therapy.

Unless previously terminated, the Kite Agreement will continue until the first anniversary of the date Kite provides the final ZUMA-19 study report to us or the termination of the study. Kite may elect to terminate or suspend the study at any time. Each party may terminate the Kite Agreement under certain circumstances, including (1) for an uncured breach by the other party; (2) if a party determines that the study may unreasonably affect patient safety; (3) upon certain actions by regulatory authorities that are adverse to the study; or (4) if a party determines to discontinue the development of its investigational product.
 
The Kite Agreement imposes additional obligations on the parties, such as confidentiality obligations, obligations to comply with applicable law related to patient privacy and data protection, and potential indemnification obligations. The Kite Agreement is non-exclusive.
 
Worldwide License for the Prevention of GvHD through GM-CSF Neutralization from UZH
 
In July 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent GvHD through GM-CSF neutralization. The Zurich Agreement covers various patent applications filed by UZH which complement and broaden our position in the application of GM-CSF neutralization and expands our development platform to include improving allogeneic HSCT.

Worldwide License to Gene-Editing Technology from the Mayo Foundation
 
In June 2019, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools including CRISPR-Cas9. The license covers various patent applications and know-how developed by the Mayo Foundation in collaboration with us. These licensed technologies complement and broaden our leadership position in the CAR-T/GM-CSF neutralization space and expand our discovery platform aimed at improving CAR-T therapy to include gene-edited CAR-T cells. With this license agreement, we significantly expanded our intellectual property portfolio to include gene-edited CAR-T cells which can be engineered to lack the ability to produce GM-CSF which may improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy. In addition, we have and continue to file intellectual property encompassing a broad range of gene-editing approaches related to GM-CSF knockout.
 
Lenzilumab
 
Overview and Mechanism of Action
 
Lenzilumab is a novel monoclonal antibody designed to target and neutralize human GM-CSF, which could also be described as a ‘myeloid inflammatory factor’. We used our proprietary and patent protected Humaneered antibody development platform to develop lenzilumab.
 
There is extensive evidence linking GM-CSF expression to serious and potentially life-threatening outcomes in other respiratory conditions such as COVID-19 pneumonia. GM-CSF and other downstream cytokines that are triggered by GM-CSF are elevated in patients who suffer poorer outcomes, including ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation. Neutralizing GM-CSF with lenzilumab may result in fewer days to symptom resolution, fewer days in hospital, minimization, or absence of admission to the ICU and use of invasive mechanical ventilation.
 
In addition, there is extensive published scientific evidence linking GM-CSF expression to serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy and reduced efficacy through recruitment of MDSCs. Our focus for lenzilumab development is investigating its potential to improve efficacy of CAR-T therapy and to prevent or ameliorate CAR-T therapy-related NT and CRS. Following CAR-T therapy administration, GM-CSF produced by CAR-T cells initiates a signaling cascade of inflammation that results in the trafficking and recruitment of myeloid cells to the tumor site. These myeloid cells produce key cytokines known to be associated with the development of NT and CRS thereby perpetuating the inflammatory cascade. Peer-reviewed publications in leading journals by well-recognized experts have reported that GM-CSF blood levels are elevated early after CAR-T cell administration and reach significant peak levels in patients who suffer serious NT as a side-effect of CAR-T therapy.
 
GM-CSF seems to be critical for the initiation of CRS, NT and the inflammatory cascade in COVID-19 and following CAR-T administration. GM-CSF acts as an upstream ‘initiator’ and the precursor to other cytokines involved in the cascade. GM-CSF gene knock-out (k/o) mice, or animals that lack a functional myeloid compartment, do not develop CRS and have normal levels of downstream cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1 and MCP-1/CCL2. Animals that are k/o for IL-1, INF-gamma and IL-6 still develop CRS in models which recapitulate this syndrome. This is very telling, given that some investigators believe IL-6 to be causative of CRS. In addition, in pivotal clinical studies, IL-6 has not been shown to correlate with severe NT or CRS emergence. In the COVID-19 setting, multiple late-stage clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia when dosed with IL-6 inhibitors. Recently published results from the RECOVERY trial have demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory treatment, tocilizumab, reduces the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, IL-6 inhibitors have Black Box Warnings in the product label and package inserts related to an increase of potentially fatal infections, including respiratory and an increase in viral reactivation. In the COVID-19 setting, these may be particularly concerning, given the viral and respiratory issues at work. The benefit:risk to patients who are not end-stage and with co-morbidities where the additional risk posed by these warnings may need to be carefully assessed before using IL-6 inhibitors off-label and in studies in COVID-19 patients.

The lack of GM-CSF does not affect T-cell mediated cancer-killing, or cytotoxicity, as GM-CSF k/o animals had equivalent effector to target cell (E:T) ratios and cytotoxic activity against tumor cells in our published studies. GM-CSF is required for CCR2+ monocytes to initiate and sustain neuro-inflammation. It is postulated that GM-CSF induces CCR2+ inflammatory myeloid derived cells to infiltrate into the CNS, activating microglial cells; the activated microglial cells then increase their expression of CCL2/MCP-1 to further recruit inflammatory myeloid cells in a self-perpetuating manner, forming a positive feedback loop. Research from CAR-T clinical trials demonstrated that fever and elevated MCP-1 levels 36 hours post CAR-T treatment were most predictive of severe CRS and NT across patients with NHL, ALL and CLL, providing further support for the mechanism by which GM-CSF may contribute to these toxicities.
 
The field of COVID-19 is extremely dynamic and fast-moving, with multiple publications and other information appearing at a very rapid pace, as clinical practice endeavors to optimize care for patients. 
 
There are many other publications that point to the pivotal role of GM-CSF in CRS and NT in CAR-T therapy, as well as potentially hampering efficacy. Based on these publications and extensive discussions with leading key opinion leaders, we believe that lenzilumab, used as alongside CAR-T therapy offers several potential benefits, including:
 

· | Lower rates of severe/grades >3 CRS and all grades of CRS;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Lower rates of severe/grades >3 NT and all grades of NT;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Lower rates of ICU admissions and duration of hospitalization;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved anti-tumor response (e.g. ORR, CR) and overall patient outcomes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved duration of response and reduced relapse rates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved cost effectiveness and reduced direct/indirect costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved reimbursement, and preferential formulary placement for CAR-T;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansion of CAR-T beyond the relapse/refractory setting to second-line and potential first-line use due to improved benefit-risk profile, increasing utilization to a significantly larger pool of patients;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansion of CAR-T into solid tumor treatments; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Scaling back or removal of current CAR-T required REMS programs and “Black Box” warnings due to improved benefit-risk profile of CAR-T.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Preclinical studies in mice conducted at the Mayo Clinic using human ALL blasts, human CD19 CAR-T, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), demonstrated that blockade of GM-CSF with lenzilumab prevented the onset of CRS, reduced neuro-inflammation by 75% (as assessed by quantitative MRI) and maintained the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) compared to CAR-T plus control antibody treatment, where CRS, neuro-inflammation and BBB disruption can be profoundly affected. The administration of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy led to a significant (5-fold) increase in proliferation of CAR-T cells and improved CAR-T effector function, presumably due to a decrease in MDSC expansion and trafficking which is known to be promulgated by GM-CSF. GM-CSF neutralization in combination with CAR-T therapy reduced relapse, enhanced anti-tumor response and improved overall survival compared to CAR-T therapy alone and these data were published in ‘blood’. Moreover, the combination of lenzilumab and CAR-T reduced myeloid cell infiltration into the CNS and resulted in significantly better leukemic control as quantified by flow cytometry compared to CAR-T and control antibody. Human data from CAR-T clinical trials suggests that the only cytokines associated with grade > 3 NT are GM-CSF, IL-2 and IL-15. Moreover, in patients who developed severe NT, there was a 17-fold increase in myeloid cell trafficking into the CNS further establishing the role of GM-CSF in the expansion and trafficking of myeloid cells in the toxicities associated with CAR-T therapy.
 
We are also developing lenzilumab alongside allogeneic HSCT for patients with hematological cancers. Accordingly, we are assessing plans to investigate use of lenzilumab as a necessary companion product to any allogeneic HSCT and as a part of the standard pre-conditioning that all patients receiving allogeneic HSCT should receive or as an early treatment option for patients identified as high risk by certain biomarkers.

Clinical data also shows the potential for lenzilumab as a treatment for certain autoimmune and other inflammatory conditions, including eosinophilic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”), psoriatic arthritis (“PsA”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (“JIA”), giant cell arteritis (“GCA”), atopic dermatitis (“AD”) and systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”). There is potential for a range of other oncology, immunology and autoimmune conditions and we are investigating partnering lifecycle management opportunities for lenzilumab in high value markets with strong unmet medical needs.
 
Development Program
 
As a Treatment and/or Prevention of Cytokine Storm Associated with COVID-19
 
We have completed enrollment in a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, clinical trial in the setting of COVID-19. There were 18 clinical sites recruiting patients into this study in the US and 11 sites in Brazil. The Phase 3 trial is assessing the safety and efficacy of lenzilumab in reducing severe outcomes in hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
 
There are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CRS/cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. There are numerous products currently in development for COVID-19 which can be broadly categorized as direct acting antivirals, immunomodulators, and other preventative strategies such as vaccines or neutralizing antibodies., Remdesivir (a direct acting antiviral) was approved by FDA for COVID-19. There is no evidence that remdesivir offers a mortality benefit and the largest remdesivir-based global study conducted by the World Health Organization failed to show benefit from remdesivir treatment. Other direct acting antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (with or without a macrolide) have not demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials.
 
Other than the recently published results from the RECOVERY trial which demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory treatment, tocilizumab, in addition to steroids, reduces the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, no immunomodulator therapy has proven efficacy in a randomized controlled clinical trial in the setting of COVID-19. Other studies involving tocilizumab have failed to demonstrate benefit. In addition, IL-1 and IL-1 receptor inhibitors, respectively Ilaris (canakinumab) and Kineret (anakinra) have both failed to demonstrate benefit in Phase 3 studies, as has the oral JAK inhibitor Jakafi (ruxolitinib) and the BTK inhibitor Calquence (acalabrutinib). Baricitinib a JAK inhibitor is authorized for use in combination with remdesivir for COVID-19. The anti-GM-CSF agent, otilimab failed in an 806-patient randomized controlled study sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”). In a post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients older than 70, there was an apparent benefit in the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28 and mortality at day 60. A 350-patient follow-on Phase 3 study is planned to determine if the benefit in patients older than 70 can be confirmed. It is unclear whether the anti-GM-CSF agents gimsilumab and namilumab are continuing development for COVID-19 and the primary endpoint for mavrilimumab for COVID-19 in a 40 patient study was recently missed, though there were some promising data in this Phase 2 study.
 
As an upstream regulator of cytokine storm, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab may offer advantages over other immunomodulator strategies that either target other downstream cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, or MIP-1 alpha or are broadly immunosuppressive and target cytokine signaling pathways non-selectively through JAK inhibition. In addition, lenzilumab is the only immunomodulator that was in an active clinical trial to prevent cytokine storm prior to COVID-19 and is currently the only agent in an active Phase 3 trial targeting GM-CSF.
 
Lenzilumab was granted emergency single use IND authorization from the FDA (often referred to as compassionate use) to treat patients with COVID-19. On June 15, 2020, we announced that Mayo Clinic published data derived from the compassionate use of lenzilumab in the treatment of 12 patients hospitalized in the Mayo Clinic system. Under applicable FDA rules, a patient cannot receive a compassionate use drug unless FDA has issued an individual patient emergency IND authorization, which the Mayo Clinic requested from FDA prior to each individual patient dosing of lenzilumab. Accordingly, there was no randomized control group in the Mayo Clinic program. We did not pre-select patients to receive lenzilumab through the compassionate use program and did not deny any requests for compassionate use. Mayo Clinic clinicians solely determined which patients for which they would request emergency IND authorization from the FDA.

The patients receiving lenzilumab were hospitalized and required supplemental oxygen as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia. They were also viewed as being at high risk of further disease progression. All patients had elevation in at least one inflammatory biomarker prior to receiving lenzilumab. All patients had at least one co-morbidity associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 and several patients had multiple co-morbidities: 58% had diabetes mellitus, 58% had hypertension, 58% had underlying lung diseases, 50% were obese (defined as a BMI greater than 30), 17% had chronic kidney disease and 17% had coronary artery disease. The median age was 65 years.
 
Patients receiving lenzilumab showed rapid clinical improvement with an 80% relative reduction in the risk of progressing to IMV and/or death, a median time to median time to discharge of five days versus 11 days for controls. Patients also demonstrated rapid improvement in oxygenation and inflammatory cytokines consistent with the improved clinical outcomes.
 
As a Sequenced Therapy in Combination with CD19 Targeted CAR-T Therapies
 
Our current clinical and regulatory development plan is focused on the Kite Agreement we executed in May 2019. Pursuant to the Kite Agreement, the parties have agreed to conduct a multi-center Phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) of lenzilumab with Kite’s Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, including DLBCL which is currently enrolling. Kite is the sponsor of ZUMA-19 and is responsible for its conduct. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta. In addition, efficacy and healthcare resource utilization will be assessed. On June 30, 2020, we announced that the first patient had been infused in the ZUMA-19 study.
 
Kite’s Yescarta is one of four CAR-T therapies that have been approved by FDA and is the leading CAR-T by revenue. Our collaboration with Kite is the only current clinical collaboration that is enrolling patients with the potential to improve both the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy. The Kite Agreement is non-exclusive. Depending upon FDA feedback, and the number of patients enrolled, we believe ZUMA-19 may serve as the basis for registration for lenzilumab.
 
As a Companion to Allogeneic HSCT
 
We believe lenzilumab has potential to prevent or reduce GvHD in allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer as a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. In July 2019, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent GvHD through GM-CSF neutralization, thereby expanding our development platform to include improving the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT. A study published in ‘blood advances’, an official journal of the American Society of Hematology, suggests that neutralizing or blocking GM-CSF may limit or prevent GvHD in the gastrointestinal tract (Gartlan, K., et al, October 8, 2019, vol. 3, no.19).
 
We plan to study lenzilumab as a companion to allogeneic HSCT for patients with hematological cancers. We are collaborating with IMPACT, a clinical trial partnership of 22 transplant centers in the United Kingdom, in planning a potential randomized, placebo controlled, Phase 2/3 study focused on early intervention with lenzilumab in patients at high risk or intermediate risk for steroid refractory acute GvHD based on specific biomarkers.  The goal of the trial, as it is currently contemplated, would be to determine the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab in reducing non-relapse mortality at six months.
 
Other Inflammatory Conditions
 
Previous clinical studies of lenzilumab include a repeat-dose, Phase 2 clinical trial of lenzilumab in rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) with the inclusion of a run-in portion. On completing the run-in portion of this trial, we reassessed the increasingly competitive RA market and chose to redirect our study of lenzilumab to other areas given the competitive intensity and diminishing levels of unmet need in RA relative to some other medical areas. In addition to the 520 patients enrolled in the COVID-19 study and an expected 200 patients in the ACTIV-5 study, we have generated tolerability data in 125 patients in various clinical studies, including in asthma and CMML.

Gene-edited CAR-T Therapies using GM-CSF Gene Knockout
 
We believe that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy via gene-edited CAR-T cells which can be engineered to lack the ability to produce GM-CSF, thereby avoiding any efficacy/toxicity linkage and potentially preserving and improving upon the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.
 
We are advancing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform through the Mayo Agreement that we entered into in June 2019 with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools including CRISPR-Cas9. The Mayo Agreement broadened our leadership position in the GM-CSF neutralization space and expanded our discovery platform aimed at improving CAR-T therapy to include gene-edited CAR-T cells.
 
Preclinical data indicates that GM-CSF knockout CAR-T cells show improved overall survival compared to GM-CSF-expressing CAR-T cells, in addition to the expected benefits of reduced serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. We are establishing a platform of next-generation combinatorial gene knockout CAR-T cells that have potential to be applied across both autologous and allogeneic approaches and we are also investigating multiple CAR-T cell designs using precise dual and triple gene editing to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity while simultaneously preventing CAR-T therapy induced toxicities. Through targeted gene expression and modulating cytokine activation signaling, we may be able to increase the proportion of fitter T-cells produced during expansion, increase the proliferative potential, and inhibit activation-induced cell death, thereby improving the cancer killing activity of our engineered CAR-T cells thereby making them more effective and safer in the treatment of cancers. Preclinical data indicates that CAR-T cells express GM-CSF and signal through GM-CSF receptors upon activation in an autocrine fashion. GM-CSF knockout CAR-T cells are not able to signal through this pathway which results in a gene expression profile distinct from GM-CSF-expressing CAR-T cells after in vitro expansion. This includes lower levels of Fas expression which may indicate a less exhausted state of the CAR-T cells. These data were presented at the 2019 ASH annual meeting.
 
We continue to explore exhaustion markers of GM-CSF knockout CAR-T cells relative to GM-CSF-expressing CAR-T cells and possible implications for improved safety and efficacy. We plan to continue development of this technology in combination approaches that could add to the observed efficacy benefits of current generation CAR-T products.
 
Ifabotuzumab
 
Ifabotuzumab is a Humaneered monoclonal antibody, formerly referred to as KB004, which targets EphA3, and in which the antibody carbohydrate chains lack fucose, thereby enhancing the targeted cell-killing activity of the antibody. We believe that ifabotuzumab has the potential for treating solid tumors, hematologic malignancies and serious pulmonary conditions. In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research (“LICR”) pursuant to which LICR granted certain exclusive rights to the ifabotuzumab prototype (referred to as IIIA4) as well as EphA3 intellectual property.
 
Ifabotuzumab binds to EphA3, which plays an important role in cell positioning and tissue organization during fetal development but is not thought to be expressed nor play a significant role in healthy adults. EphA3 is a tyrosine kinase receptor, aberrantly expressed on the tumor vasculature and tumor stroma in several solid tumors including melanoma, breast cancer, small and non-small cell lung cancer (“SCLC” and “NSCLC”), colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, renal cancer, GBM, and prostate cancer, making it an attractive target for a range of cancers. Publications related to certain cancers have indicated that EphA3 tumor cell expression correlates with cancer growth and a poor prognosis. EphA3 is overexpressed in GBM and, in particular, in the most aggressive mesenchymal subtype. Importantly, EphA3 is highly expressed on the tumor-initiating cell population in glioma and appears to be critically involved in maintaining tumor cells in a less differentiated state by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. EphA3 knockdown or depletion of EphA3-positive tumor cells may reduce tumorigenic potential to a degree comparable to treatment with a therapeutic radiolabeled EphA3-specific monoclonal antibody. We believe EphA3 is a functional, targetable receptor in GBM and other solid tumors. A study published in December 2018 in ‘Cancers’ showed that an antibody drug conjugate (“ADC”) comprising IIIA4 (a predecessor monoclonal antibody and prototype for ifabotuzumab) showed significant survival benefit in mice with GBM.

Anti-EphA3 treatment has shown encouraging preclinical results in multiple experiment types, including patient primary tumor cell assays, colony forming assays, and xenograft mouse models. Upon binding to EphA3, ifabotuzumab causes cell killing to occur either through antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity or through direct apoptosis, and in the case of tumor neovasculature, through cell rounding and blood vessel disruption. Given the expression pattern of EphA3 in multiple tumor types, ifabotuzumab may have the potential to kill cancer cells and the tumor stem cell microenvironment, providing for long-term responses while sparing normal cells.
 
We completed the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ifabotuzumab in multiple hematologic malignancies for which the preliminary results were published in the journal Leukemia Research in 2016. We have conducted a Phase 1/2 trial for ifabotuzumab in multiple hematologic malignancies. The most common adverse event attributed to ifabotuzumab in this trial was infusion reactions (chills, fever, nausea, hypertension, and rapid heart rate) which is an expected safety finding based on the mechanism of action. The majority of infusion reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved with temporary stoppage of infusion and/or use of medications to treat symptoms. In 2014, we completed the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of our study, primarily treating patients with AML as well as patients with MDS and myelofibrosis (“MF”).
 
A Phase 1 safety and imaging trial of radio-labeled ifabotuzumab in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, a particularly aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer, has fully enrolled at two centers in Australia, the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute (“ONJCRI”) in Melbourne and the Queensland Institute for Medical Research in Brisbane and interim data have been presented at both American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) and  Society for Neuro-Oncology (“SNO”) in 2019, with final data expected to be presented in 2021. The lead investigators at the ONJCRI, are also evaluating an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC” or “ADCs”) based on ifabotuzumab in solid tumor models. The Phase 1 clinical trial has enrolled all 12 patients. Preliminary imaging data reported at AACR and at SNO demonstrated that administration of ifabotuzumab resulted in rapid, specific targeting of GBM tumors in all patients. Whole body bio-distribution imaging demonstrated no normal tissue uptake of the antibody. Post-treatment MRI scans showed predominant T2/Flair changes which were consistent with treatment effect on tumor vasculature. We continue to explore partnering opportunities and seek governmental and institutional grants to facilitate the further development of ifabotuzumab in a range of cancer types.
 
We are in discussions with separate and various parties and may initiate partnerships to pursue some of the following activities:
 

· | Complete the on-going clinical study and preclinical studies with various ADCs that are based on ifabotuzumab (in partnership with leading centers in Australia); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop bi-specific antibodies based on ifabotuzumab.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
Centers in Australia have worked independently on IIIA4, the murine antibody parent of ifabotuzumab, as an ADC in mice and a December 2018 publication in the journal ‘Cancers’ showed that in mice engrafted with GBM, treatment with an ADC based on IIIA4 showed significantly improved survival.

HGEN005
 
HGEN005 is a Humaneered monoclonal antibody, formerly referred to as KB005, which targets the EMR1, and in which the antibody carbohydrate chains lack fucose, thereby enhancing the targeted cell-killing activity of the antibody.
 
A major limitation of current eosinophil-targeted therapies is incomplete depletion of tissue eosinophils and/or lack of cell selectivity. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. If too many eosinophils are produced in the body, chronic inflammation and tissue and organ damage may result. The origin and development of eosinophilic disorders is mostly due to eosinophils infiltrating tissue. EMR1 is expressed exclusively on eosinophils, making it an ideal target for the treatment of eosinophilic disorders. Regardless of the eosinophilic disorder, mature eosinophils express EMR1 in tissue, blood and bone marrow in patients with eosinophilia. We believe that because of its high selectivity, HGEN005 has significant potential to treat serious eosinophil diseases.
 
In preclinical work, HGEN005’s anti-EMR1 activity resulted in dramatically enhanced NK killing of eosinophils from normal and eosinophilic donors and also induced a rapid and sustained depletion of eosinophils in a non-human primate model without any clinically significant adverse events. We have engaged with NIH to discuss expanding the initial work they have conducted utilizing HGEN005 and discussions are underway with a leading center in the US to perform the IND-enabling work.
 
Our Humaneered Technology 
 
Our proprietary and patented Humaneered technology platform is a method for converting existing antibodies (typically murine) into engineered, high-affinity human antibodies designed for therapeutic use, particularly for chronic conditions. We have developed or in-licensed targets or research (mouse) antibodies, typically from academic institutions, and then applied our Humaneered technology to them. Lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005 are Humaneered antibodies. In aggregate, our Humaneered antibodies have been tested clinically in more than 200 patients with no evidence of serious immunogenicity. Our Humaneered antibodies are closer to human antibodies than chimeric or conventionally humanized antibodies and have a high affinity for their target but low immunogenicity. Specifically, our Humaneered technology generates an antibody from an existing antibody with the required specificity as a starting point and, we believe, provides the following additional advantages:

· | high potency;
--+--------------


· | slow off-rate;
--+---------------


· | high solubility;
--+-----------------


· | retention of identical target epitope specificity and generation of higher affinity antibodies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | high antibody expression yields;
--+---------------------------------


· | attractive cost-of-goods;
--+--------------------------


· | physiochemical properties that facilitate process development and formulation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lack of aggregation at high concentration;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | very-near-to-human germ line sequence (which may mean they are less likely to induce an inappropriate immune response when used chronically, which has proven to be the case in clinical studies); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an optimized antibody processing time of three to six months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
As we are focused on progressing our current portfolio of antibodies through clinical development and out-licensing, we are not currently dedicating additional resources to the research or development of additional Humaneered antibodies other than our existing portfolio of lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property (IP) is an important part of our strategy and has been a key focus area for the Company. We have and continue to file aggressively on our own inventions and in-license intellectual property and technology as it relates to our therapeutic interests. We believe that we are a leader in the field of GM-CSF neutralization to ameliorate cytokine storm as it relates to COVID-19, CAR-T and GvHD.

Licensing and Collaborations
 
CRADA
 
On November 5, 2020, we and the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND or JPEO) entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in support of Operation Warp Speed (“OWS”), to assist in the development of our lead product candidate, lenzilumab, in advance of a potential EUA for COVID-19.
 
On January 22, 2021, we announced an expansion of the CRADA that the company had previously entered with JPEO on November 5, 2020, was subsequently co-signed by BARDA. This provides Humanigen with access to manufacturing capacity reserved by BARDA for fill-finish product to accelerate the drug product manufacturing of lenzilumab.
 
Pursuant to the CRADA, we have been provided access to a full-scale, integrated team of OWS manufacturing, and regulatory subject matter experts, leading decision makers and statistical support in anticipation of applying for EUA and subsequently a BLA for lenzilumab as a potential treatment for COVID-19. The CRADA also provides that OWS regulatory experts will work with us on FDA communications, meetings and regulatory filings. The CRADA aims to support the lenzilumab Phase 3 clinical trial output, focusing on efficiently generating an EUA and BLA submission. In addition to providing access under EUA, a goal of the CRADA is to ensure lenzilumab receives the benefits provided by Public Law 115-92.
 
Clinical Trial Agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
 
On July 24, 2020, we entered into a clinical trial agreement (the “Clinical Trial Agreement”) with NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health, which is part of the United States Government Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, lenzilumab will be an agent to be evaluated in the NIAID-sponsored ACTIV-5/Big Effect Trial (BET) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
 
ACTIV-5 will evaluate the combination of lenzilumab and Gilead’s investigational antiviral, remdesivir, on treatment outcomes versus placebo and remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The trial is expected to enroll 100 patients in each arm of the study with an interim analysis for efficacy after 50 patients have been enrolled in each arm.
 
Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, NIAID will serve as sponsor and will be responsible for supervising and overseeing ACTIV-5. The Company will be responsible for providing lenzilumab to NIAID without charge and in quantities to ensure a sufficient supply of lenzilumab.
 
The University of Zurich
 
On July 19, 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent GvHD through GM-CSF neutralization. The Zurich Agreement covers various patent applications filed by UZH which complement and broaden our position in the application of GM-CSF neutralization and expands our development platform to include improving allogeneic HSCT.
 
The Zurich Agreement required an initial one-time payment of $100,000, which we paid to UZH on July 29, 2019. The Zurich Agreement also requires the payment of annual license maintenance fees, as well as milestones and royalties upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones.

The term of the Zurich Agreement runs from July 19, 2019 until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right, subject to termination rights specified in the agreement.
 
The Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research
 
On June 19, 2019, we entered into the Mayo Agreement with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools including CRISPR-Cas9. The license covers various patent applications and know-how developed by Mayo Foundation in collaboration with us. These licensed technologies complement and broaden our position in the GM-CSF neutralization space and expand our discovery platform aimed at improving CAR-T to include gene-edited CAR-T cells. The Mayo Agreement requires the payment of milestones and royalties upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones.
 
The term of the Mayo Agreement runs from May 29, 2019 until the later of: (i) the expiration date of the last to expire of the patent rights granted; or (ii) the conclusion of a period of ten (10) years from the date of the first commercial sale, subject to termination rights specified in the agreement.
 
Kite
 
On May 30, 2019, we entered into the Kite Agreement. Pursuant to the Kite Agreement, the parties agreed to conduct a multi-center Phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) of lenzilumab with Kite’s Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta. Various other important parameters, including efficacy and healthcare resource utilization, will also be measured. Kite is the sponsor of ZUMA-19 and responsible for its conduct. On June 30, 2020, we announced that the first patient had been infused in the ZUMA-19 study.
 
The Kite Agreement provides that we and Kite will split only the out-of-pocket costs incurred in conducting ZUMA-19, including third-party expenses incurred in accordance with a mutually agreed budget. We currently project we will be responsible for an aggregate of up to approximately $8 million in out-of-pocket costs, assuming up to a total of 72 patients are recruited for ZUMA-19 as a multi-center Study. Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with ZUMA-19.

The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 
In 2004, we entered into a license agreement with the LICR pursuant to which LICR granted to us an exclusive license for intellectual property rights and materials related to chimeric anti-GM-CSF antibodies that formed the basis for lenzilumab. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to develop antibodies related to LICR’s antibodies against GM-CSF. We are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and sell lenzilumab. We pay LICR a quarterly license fee and are obligated to pay to LICR a royalty from 1.5% to 3% of net sales of licensed products, subject to certain potential offsets and deductions. Our royalty obligation applies on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, and will begin on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a given country and end on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent covering a licensed product in a given country (which in the US is currently expected in 2029 for the composition of matter and 2038 for methods of use in CAR-T) or 10 years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in the country. We must also pay to LICR a certain percentage of sublicensing revenue received by us. Payments made to LICR under this license for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

Other License Agreements
 
LICR and ifabotuzumab
 
In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with LICR pursuant to which LICR granted to us certain exclusive rights to the ifabotuzumab prototype (IIIA4) which targets EphA3 and EphA3-related intellectual property. Under the agreement, we obtained rights to develop and commercialize products made through use of licensed patents and any improvements thereto, including human or Humaneered antibodies that bind to or modulate EphA3. We paid LICR an upfront option fee of $0.05 million and a further $0.05 million upon our exercise of the option for the exclusive license outlined above. We are responsible for contingent milestone payments of less than $2.5 million and royalties of 3% of net sales subject to certain potential offsets and deductions. In addition, we are obligated to pay to LICR a percentage of certain payments we receive from any sublicensee in consideration for a sublicense. Our royalty obligation exists on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, which will begin on the first commercial sale and end on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent covering such licensed product in such country, which in the US is currently expected in 2031, or 10 years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.
 
BioWa and Lonza 
 
In 2010, we entered into a license agreement with BioWa, Inc. (“BioWa”), and Lonza Sales AG (“Lonza”) pursuant to which BioWa and Lonza granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain know-how and patents related to antibody expression and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity enhancing technology using BioWa and Lonza’s Potelligent® CHOK1SV technology. This technology is used to enhance the cell killing capabilities of antibodies and is currently used by us in connection with our development of ifabotuzumab. Under this agreement, we owe annual license fees, milestone payments in connection with certain regulatory and sales milestones and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products developed under the agreement. The agreement expires upon the expiration of royalty payment obligations under the agreement, is terminable at will by us upon written notice, is terminable by BioWa and Lonza if we challenge or otherwise oppose any licensed patents under the agreement and is terminable by either party upon the occurrence of an uncured material breach or insolvency.
 
Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We use a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protections to protect our product candidates and platforms. We will be able to protect our product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or to the extent our technology is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Intellectual property is an important part of our strategy. We have and continue to file aggressively on our own inventions and in-license intellectual property and technology as it relates to our therapeutic interests. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights for and to extend the life of patents covering lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab, HGEN005, our Humaneered technology, and our GM-CSF gene-editing CAR-T platform technologies, to preserve trade secrets and proprietary know how, and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We actively seek patent protection, if available, in the US and select foreign countries for the technology we develop. We have 111 registered patents, including 16 registered in the US and 95 registered in foreign countries. Of the 111 registered patents, 87 are owned by us, 9 are owned jointly with a third party and 15 are exclusively licensed from a third party. We also have 53 patent applications pending globally, of which 21 are owned by us, 7 are owned jointly with a third party and 25 are exclusively licensed from a third party. 
 
Using our Humaneered technology, we have developed and own two composition of matter US patents covering lenzilumab and related anti-GM-CSF antibodies that provide patent protection through April 2029, a granted composition of matter patent in 15 European countries and certain foreign countries, and have two U.S. patents and six additional pending patent applications in the US and one PCT international patent application covering various methods of treatment, including in the CAR-T space covering a broad and comprehensive range of approaches to neutralizing GM-CSF, including the use of GM-CSF k/o CAR-T cells, which, if granted, are expected to confer protection to at least October 2038. We also have two currently pending foreign patent applications that are jointly owned with a third party for anti-EphA3 antibodies and their use, and we developed and own an issued US composition of matter patent covering ifabotuzumab and related anti-EphA3 antibodies, which is currently expected to expire in 2031, and own 22 foreign patents to anti-EphA3 antibodies and therapeutic uses, in addition to owning four US patents to therapeutic methods using anti-EphA3 antibodies and seven foreign patents owned jointly with a third party covering methods of treatment with anti-EphA3 antibodies. The two US and 26 foreign patents to our Humaneered technology cover methods of producing human antibodies that are very specific for target antigens using only a small region from mouse antibodies.

We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products, even though we may be able to prevent their commercial use without our permission if our intellectual property allows for such limitations. Patents also will not protect our products if competitors devise ways of making or using these products without legally infringing our patents. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake.
 
In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. However, prospective partners may have to license or otherwise come to an agreement with us if they wish to use our products and those products and methods of use of such products have issued patents in those territories.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators, and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and our employees to execute assignment of invention agreements to us on commencement of their employment. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing any proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
We outsource all development activities, including the development of formulation prototypes. We do not have, nor do we plan to have, any manufacturing facilities. Instead, we have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties for the manufacture of drug substance and product. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package, and distribute investigational drug products. The use of contract manufacturers can be expensive, complicated and time consuming and could delay clinical trials, drug approval and potential product launch. We believe our outsourcing approach allows us to maintain a leaner staffing approach and a more flexible infrastructure, allowing us to focus our expertise on developing our products. It does however mean that we have to carefully plan the availability of manufacturing ‘slots’ and the availability of drug for investigation in preclinical and clinical trials. We have been proactive and aggressive in pursuing manufacturing slots for lenzilumab in connection with our clinical trial programs and expect to commit the necessary resources to ensure that our manufacturing capabilities do not hinder our ability to attain regulatory approvals for its use. During the latter half of 2020, and continuing into 2021, it has become more challenging and expensive to obtain these slots due to increased demand for production at our CMOs, many of which also manufacture vaccines and other therapeutics. Even after being reserved, the manufacturing slots for which we contract are subject to risk of displacement as mandated from Rated Orders issued under the Defense Production Act (DPA). This displacement risk has caused us to expend significant efforts to manage our supply chain. Despite those efforts, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience shortages of raw materials and critical components necessary for our manufacturing processes.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into agreements with several contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the manufacture of bulk drug substance (“BDS”) for our lenzilumab clinical trial activities in COVID-19 as well as for a potential launch of lenzilumab in anticipation of an EUA in 2021. We have also entered into agreements for filling, finishing and packaging of the drug. These agreements represent large financial commitments, including upfront amounts prior to commencement of manufacturing and progress payments through the course of the manufacturing process and include payments for the initial technology transfer. A summary of the various CMOs with whom we have contracted for services is as follows:
 

Contract Manufacturer | Services 
-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC | Bulk drug substance manufacture, fill and finish, clinical packaging
Lonza Sales AG | Bulk drug substance manufacture 
Patheon Biologics LLC | Bulk drug substance manufacture 
Avid BioServices, Inc. | Bulk drug substance manufacture 
Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. | Fill and finish 
Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services | Fill and finish 
Bryllan LLC | Fill and finish 
PCI Pharma Services | Commercial packaging 

Sales and Marketing
 
We outsource our sales and marketing infrastructure necessary to market and sell our products, if authorized or approved. The establishment of a sales and marketing operation can be expensive, complicated and time consuming and could delay any potential product launch. As our drug candidates progress, we may also seek strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties including those with existing infrastructure and with government bodies. The following summarizes our important sales and marketing arrangements.
Eversana Agreement
 
On January 10, 2021, we announced that we had entered into a master services agreement (the “Eversana Agreement”) with Eversana Life Science Services, LLC (“Eversana”) pursuant to which Eversana will provide us multiple services from its integrated commercial platform in preparation for the potential commercialization of lenzilumab, for treatment of hospitalized and hypoxic COVID-19 patients.
 
Under the Eversana Agreement, Eversana will serve as our end-to-end commercial partner, providing us with a full suite of services in connection with the potential launch of lenzilumab. Eversana services initially will comprise marketing, market access and field solution services, and may expand to other areas including patient services, compliance services, professional services, data and analytics, and health economics outcome research, as may be negotiated by the parties and set forth in statements of work delivered in accordance with the Eversana Agreement.
 
We will pay Eversana fees and reimburse it for its expenses in performing the services as established in applicable statements of work. Eversana has agreed to defer its fees pending our receipt of an EUA from the FDA for lenzilumab for hospitalized and hypoxic COVID-19 patients. If we have not received an EUA by April 30, 2021 or such later date as to which the parties otherwise may agree, either party may terminate the Agreement immediately; Eversana will not receive the deferred fees upon such termination.
 
The Eversana Agreement provides for a one-year term and will renew for subsequent one-year terms unless either party provides a notice of non-renewal. After the first year, we may terminate the Eversana Agreement upon advance written notice to Eversana. The Eversana Agreement contains customary provisions allowing either party to terminate the Eversana Agreement as a result of certain changes in law and material breaches and certain insolvency events by or relating to the other party.
 
The Eversana Agreement imposes customary mutual obligations on the parties to protect and not disclose the confidential information and intellectual property of the other, and contains insurance, non-solicitation, indemnification and limitation of liability provisions customary for service contracts of this type.
 
Cardinal Agreement
 
On September 9, 2020 we entered into an agreement with Cardinal Health (“Cardinal”) to provide shipping, receiving, returns, warehousing, invoicing, collections, data collection and exchange, as well as other third-party logistics services for lenzilumab in preparation for receipt of an EUA for COVID-19.  The agreement is for a three-year term and is subject to annual renewal thereafter.  It is anticipated that initially Cardinal will take title of the product while we finalize US state licensing. Cardinal will receive monthly fees for services as well as a percentage of the Wholesaler Acquisition Cost (WAC) while operating in the title model.

Competition
 
We compete in an industry characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a changing regulatory and legislative landscape and a strong emphasis on the benefits of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivities. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We compete with these parties to develop potential biologic therapies to make CAR-T therapy and allogeneic HSCT safer and more effective and to develop a potential treatment for hematologic cancers, in addition to recruiting highly qualified personnel. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies, with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors, including competitors relying to a large extent on our drug approvals or on our biologics approvals, or with generic copies of our product approved by FDA, as bio-similars, referencing our drug products. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do.
 
In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful with respect to their products than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance for our products. In addition, our competitors’ products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and supporting the commercialization of any of our product candidates. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. After one of our product candidates is approved, FDA may also approve a generic version with the same or similar dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use as our product. These bio-similar equivalents would be less costly to bring to market and could generally be offered at lower prices, thereby limiting our ability to gain or retain market share. However, our product candidates are all biologics and, as such, would benefit from 12 years market exclusivity from first licensure.
 
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to in-license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. The more established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, institutional experience, and historical corporate reputation.
 
Lenzilumab and COVID-19 competition
 
There are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CRS/cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. There are numerous products currently in development for COVID-19 which can be broadly categorized as direct acting antivirals, immunomodulators, anticoagulants and other preventative strategies such as vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Remdesivir (a direct acting antiviral) was approved by FDA for COVID-19. There is no evidence that remdesivir offers a mortality benefit and the largest remdesivir-based global study conducted by the World Health Organization failed to show benefit from remdesivir treatment. Other direct acting antiviral agents such as lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (with or without a macrolide) have not demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Other treatments available under EUA include baricitinib (Olumiant) in combination with remdesivir (Veklury), bamlanivimab alone and with Etesevimab, and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab). Published data to date from randomized controlled clinical trials in the setting of COVID-19 and the two leading IL-6 inhibitors, Actemra (tocilizumab) and Kevzara (sarilumab) has been mixed. Recently published results from The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial have demonstrated that an anti-inflammatory treatment, tocilizumab, reduces the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The study also showed that tocilizumab shortens the time until patients are successfully discharged from hospital and reduces the need for a mechanical ventilator. The relative reduction in mortality was 14% and the relative reduction in progressing to IMV or death was 15%. A total of 2,022 patients were randomly allocated to receive tocilizumab by intravenous infusion and were compared with 2,094 patients randomly allocated to usual care alone. 82% of patients were taking a systemic steroid such as dexamethasone. Treatment with tocilizumab significantly reduced deaths: 596 (29%) of the patients in the tocilizumab group died within 28 days compared with 694 (33%) patients in the usual care group (rate ratio 0·86; [95% confidence interval [CI] 0·77 to 0·96]; p=0·007), an absolute difference of 4%. Tocilizumab also increased the probability of discharge alive within 28 days from 47% to 54% (rate ratio 1·23, [95% CI 1·12 to 1·34], p<0·0001). These benefits were seen in all patient subgroups, including those requiring oxygen via a simple face mask through to those requiring mechanical ventilators in an intensive care unit. Among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation when entered into the trial, tocilizumab significantly reduced the chance of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death from 38% to 33% (risk ratio 0·85, [95% CI 0·78 to 0·93], p=0·0005). However, there was no evidence that tocilizumab had any effect on the chance of successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation. In June 2020, the RECOVERY trial found that the inexpensive and widely available steroid dexamethasone reduces death for patients with severe COVID-19. Dexamethasone became part of standard-of-care given to all such patients. In this trial, the benefits of tocilizumab were seen to be in addition to those of steroids.

In addition, IL-1 and IL-1 receptor inhibitors, respectively Ilaris (canakinumab) and Kineret (anakinra) have both failed to demonstrate benefit in Phase 3 studies, as has the oral JAK inhibitor Jakafi (ruxolitinib) and the BTK inhibitor Calquence (acalabrutinib). The anti-GM-CSF agent, otilimab failed in an 806-patient randomized controlled study sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”). In a post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients older than 70, there was an apparent benefit in the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28 and mortality at day 60. A 350-patient follow-on Phase 3 study is planned to determine if the benefit in the patients older than 70 can be confirmed. It is unclear whether the anti-GM-CSF agents gimsilumab and namilumab are continuing development for COVID-19 and the primary endpoint for mavrilimumab for COVID-19 in a 40 patient study was recently missed, though there were some promising data in this small Phase 2 study.
 
Lenzilumab and CAR-T-related toxicities competition
 
Significant ongoing concerns for clinicians, caregivers, patients and FDA regarding CAR-T therapy include, durability of response, long-term outcomes, manufacturing process, time to delivery of active CAR-T product, serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects, namely NT and CRS, frequency and duration of hospitalization and ICU admission, health resource utilization, cost effectiveness and reimbursement. Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus and Brevanzi carry “Black Box” warnings in their labels for NT and CRS and are subject to a REMS program, such that on-going data has to be provided to FDA and CAR-T therapy can only be administered in strictly controlled environments at trained centers.
 
FDA approval of tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor blocker, Genetech’s Actemra®) with or without high-dose corticosteroids, for the management of severe cases of CRS, was announced in conjunction with approval of Kymriah solely as part of its REMS program based on a retrospective analysis of 45 patients who received tocilizumab. Approval was subsequently also granted for tocilizumab as a treatment (not prevention) of moderate to severe CRS, despite the lack of an IND application, NDA or conduct of a prospective trial of tocilizumab in this setting. Only 20% of Kymriah or Yescarta patients treated with tocilizumab had resolution of signs and symptoms 6 days after onset of CRS and ~50% patients responded 11 days after onset of CRS. Tocilizumab is not approved for the prevention of CRS or for the prevention or treatment of NT. Tocilizumab is also not approved for the treatment of mild cases of CRS.

There are no FDA-approved therapies for the prevention of CAR-T therapy induced NT and CRS or for the treatment of CAR-T therapy induced NT. The CAR-T therapy-associated TOXicity Working Group currently recommends intensive monitoring, accurate grading and aggressive supportive care with the anti-IL-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab and/or high-dose corticosteroids. These agents are reserved only for the treatment of severe cases of CRS and are not approved for prevention. Since corticosteroids have been reported to suppress T-cell function and/or induce T-cell apoptosis, they may limit the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy and use has been generally limited to treatment of severe cases of CRS refractory to tocilizumab and severe cases of NT. Sometimes high-dose corticosteroids are used alongside tocilizumab. Tocilizumab has not been found to be effective in the prevention or management of CAR-T therapy induced NT. In fact, the prophylactic use of tocilizumab has been shown to increase both overall rates of NT and rates of severe NT with overall rates of CRS remaining unchanged in an expanded safety cohort from a CAR-T trial. As tocilizumab is an anti-IL-6 receptor blocker, serum IL-6 levels have been shown to increase shortly after administration of tocilizumab which may increase passive diffusion of IL-6 into the CNS and increase the risk of NT. In patients who received prophylactic tocilizumab, a 17-fold increase in CD14+ myeloid cells was seen in the CSF of patients who developed severe NT vs those who did not. A similar dynamic may occur with other cytokine receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies that are also being explored in this setting (e.g. anti-IL-1Ra, anti-GM-CSFRa). As the antibody directly binds the cytokine receptor, the receptor may get saturated causing the cytokine to get dislodged which leads to an initial increase in the level of the circulating cytokine. In this setting, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines can further propagate the inflammatory cascade and result in higher levels of NT and CRS when the receptor blocker is administered prophylactically. In addition, IL-1 levels have not been shown to correlate to CRS and NT in CAR-T clinical trials and there is no evidence in the clinical or preclinical setting available to support the use of GM-CSF receptor alpha blockade with CAR-T cell therapy. There are data that suggest that the mechanism of GM-CSF receptor alpha blockade may be interfere with CAR-T expansion and potentially efficacy. Our approach with lenzilumab is a different mechanism of action entirely and we have published data which shows expansion of CAR-T cells in animal models.
 
Other experimental approaches being explored include development of next-generation, CAR-T constructs, including introducing suicide genes into CAR-T cells using herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) or inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) genes with “on / off” switches, incorporating a co-stimulatory molecule into T-cells, using RNA-guided DNA targeting technology or other epitope-based / gene-editing technology. While it is possible that some of these approaches could result in lower rates of NT and/or CRS, preliminary data suggests that improvements in the safety profile are associated with lower rates of efficacy and durable response. This is not surprising given the linkage that has been shown to exist between CAR-T cell expansion, efficacy and toxicity. In addition, an agent comprised of a mixture of single-stranded oligonucleotides that is purified from the intestinal mucosa of pigs, defibrotide (Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Defitelio®) is being evaluated to reduce NT although there is no preclinical data supporting its use in this indication and the mechanisms of action is uncertain. Defibrotide is approved for the treatment of severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in adults and children who have undergone chemotherapy and a stem-cell transplant and is associated with a 37% rate of hypotension, or low blood pressure. Hypotension is a hallmark of CRS, which occurs very frequently with patients receiving CAR-T therapy. There are also several other anti-GM-CSF compounds that are in various stages of development, however the focus of these compounds appears to be in chronic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, giant cell arteritis and related disorders.
 

Government Regulation 
 
Drug Development and Approval in the U.S.
 
As a biopharmaceutical company operating in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by FDA and by other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. FDA regulates biological products such as our product candidates under the U.S. Federal Food and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and their implementing regulations. Under the PHSA, an FDA-approved biologics license application (BLA) is required to market a biological product, or biologic, in the U.S. These laws and regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for preclinical and clinical testing, development, approval, labeling, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products and product candidates. Biologics receive 12 years market exclusivity from first licensure.
Applications Relying on the Applicant’s Clinical Data
 
The approval process for a BLA under the PHSA requires the conduct of extensive studies and the submission of large amounts of data by the applicant. The biologic development process for these applications will generally include the following phases:

41
--

Preclinical Testing. Before testing any new biologic in human subjects in the U.S., a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
 
IND Application. Human clinical trials in the U.S. cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to FDA as part of the IND application, and FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the product in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless FDA raises concerns, the IND application becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials. GCP requirements are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected.
 
Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to FDA as part of the IND application. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board (IRB), at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND application may be submitted in support of a BLA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and FDA is able to validate the data. A study sponsor is required to publicly post certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results on the government website clinicaltrials.gov.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and, notably, in the CAR-T setting, FDA has granted approval to both currently marketed CAR-T therapies (Kite’s Yescarta, Tescartus and Novartis’s Kymriah) based on Phase 2 data and to tocilizumab without any prospective data in the CAR-T setting:
 

· | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational product to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase I clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the product, the side-effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the product’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen, or with the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product.

· | The FDA does not always require every approved therapy to complete Phase 1 through 3 studies to secure approval. Approval through expedited routes is at the discretion of FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The sponsoring company, FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval.
 
BLA Submission and Review
 
After completing clinical testing of an investigational biologic product, a sponsor must prepare and submit a BLA for review and approval by FDA. A BLA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application that must include, among other things, sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling. When a BLA is submitted, FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, FDA may refuse to accept the application for filing and may request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information and review of the application is delayed.
 
FDA performance goals, which are target dates and other aspirational measures of agency performance to which the agency, Congressional representatives, and industry agree through negotiations that occur every five years, generally provide for action BLA applications within 10 months of submission or 10 months from acceptance for filing for an original BLA. FDA is not expected to meet those target dates for all applications, however, and the deadline may be extended in certain circumstances, such as when the applicant submits new data late in the review period. In practice, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. In some circumstances, FDA can expedite the review of new biologics deemed to qualify for priority review, such as those intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. In those cases, the targeted action date is six months from submission, or for biologics constituting original biological products, six months from the date that FDA accepts the application for filing.
 
As part of its review, FDA may refer a BLA to an advisory committee for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Although FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations. FDA may also determine that a REMS program is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and that the product can therefore be approved. A REMS program may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, depending on what FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the product. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations, unless the requirement is waived or deferred. Receiving orphan drug designation from FDA is one situation where such a requirement may be waived.
 
After review of a BLA, FDA may determine that the product cannot be approved, or may determine that it can only be approved if the applicant cures deficiencies in the application, in which case the agency endeavors to provide the applicant with a complete list of the deficiencies in correspondence known as a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). A CRL may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, FDA may decide that the BLA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets them. Additionally, as a condition of approval, FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as “Phase IV” studies or “post-marketing requirements.” Obtaining regulatory approval often takes several years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.
 

43
--


Post-approval modifications to the drug or biologic product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials. The proposed changes would need to be submitted in a new or supplemental BLA, which would then require FDA approval.
 
Regulatory Exclusivities
 
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
 
In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was enacted, creating an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under a BLA. The BPCIA also provides innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products 12 years of exclusive use from first licensure before biosimilar versions can be licensed in the US. This means that FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of a reference biological product until 12 years after the date of first licensure of the reference biological product (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results reported to FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of first licensure of the reference biological product. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant must provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval of the biosimilar product, although the interpretation of those procedures has been subject to litigation and appears to continue to evolve. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product.
 
FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA in 2015, and the agency continues to refine the procedures and standards it will apply in implementing this approval pathway. FDA has released guidance documents interpreting specific aspects of the BPCIA in the years since. We would expect lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005, as biologics, to each receive at least 12 years exclusivity from first licensure if they are approved.
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 
For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-Phase I meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after licensing of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 

44
--


The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits a BLA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the BLA if the biologic is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary potency to inform pediatric labeling for the product. Deferrals and waivers as described above are also available.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by a further six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot license another application.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of therapeutic products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Rare diseases and conditions generally are those affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., but also include diseases or conditions affecting more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. of such product.
 
If a sponsor demonstrates that a therapeutic product, including a biological product, is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, and meets certain other criteria, FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. FDA may grant multiple orphan designations to different companies developing the same product for the same indication, until the one company is the first to be able to secure successful approval for that product. The first product approved with an orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity from the date of approval for that indication. During that period, FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. FDA can also revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet patient needs.
 
A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation is also granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, FDA will typically coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval based on more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.
 
Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions
 
FDA has implemented a number of expedited programs to help ensure that therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions, and for which there is unmet medical need, are approved and available to patients as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies’ benefits justify their risks. Among these programs are the following:

45
--

Fast Track Designation
 
FDA may designate a product for fast-track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where non-clinical or clinical data demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical need for such a disease or condition. A product can also receive fast track review if it receives breakthrough therapy designation.
 
For fast-track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with FDA and FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast-track product’s application before the application is complete, also referred to as a ‘rolling review’. This rolling review may be available if FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast-track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. Furthermore, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast-track application does not begin until the last section of the complete application is submitted. Finally, the fast-track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of fast-track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design efficient clinical trials.
Accelerated Approval
 
Under the accelerated approval pathway, FDA may approve a drug or biologic based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit; qualifying products must target a serious or life-threatening illness and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
Priority Review
 
FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA generally determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and will shorten FDA’s goal for acting on a marketing application from the standard targeted ten months to a target of six months review.

Created in 2012 under the FDASIA and extended with the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, FDA is authorized under section 529 of the FDCA to grant a PRV to BLA sponsors receiving FDA approval for a product to treat a rare pediatric disease, defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., and where more than 50% of the patients affected are aged from birth to 18 years. We believe that our product candidates which may assist with the treatment of rare pediatric cancers or other rare pediatric diseases may qualify for a PRV under this program, depending on the indication.
 
The PRV program allows the voucher holder to obtain priority review for a product application that would otherwise not receive priority review, shortening FDA’s target review period to a targeted six months following acceptance of filing of an NDA or BLA, or four months shorter than the standard review period. The voucher may be used by the sponsor who receives it, or it may be sold to another sponsor for use in that sponsor’s own marketing application. The sponsor who uses the voucher is required to pay additional user fees on top of the standard user fee for reviewing an NDA or BLA.
 
We anticipate submitting applications for one or more of these expedited programs and the targeted therapeutic indications.
 
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation
 
Recently, through the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, Congress also established another expedited program, called a RMAT designation. The Cures Act directs the FDA to facilitate an efficient development program for and expedite review of RMATs. To qualify for this program, the product must be a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or a combination of such products, and not a product solely regulated as a human cell and tissue product. The product must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address an unmet need for such disease or condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.
 
Post-Licensing Regulation
 
Once a BLA is approved and a product marketed, a sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-licensing regulatory requirements as well as any post-licensing requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the licensing process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and potency or efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing processes are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCA), which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
