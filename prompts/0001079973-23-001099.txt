ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (OTCPK:MDXL) is an innovation-driven technology company designed to deliver health and well-being services which address gaps in access to care, spiraling healthcare costs, and the pain points faced by both consumers and businesses. MediXall is structured to provide solutions that are proactive and preventive versus the current reactive system, structured primarily on treating the sick, which is inherently costly.
 
We started Health Karma in response to the design and delivery flaws we saw in the American health care system. We believe that these flaws made healthcare too expensive, reactionary, and inconvenient for far too many Americans to obtain quality health care and maintain their health. Since inception, we have been focused on changing the way individuals access, interact with, and consume healthcare. Our mission is simple: we want to provide easy access to health and wellbeing solutions to consumers and businesses, while reducing what consumers and businesses pay for it.
 
As the U.S. healthcare market remains opaque and highly fragmented for consumers, even simple healthcare transactions, such as finding a doctor, scheduling routine procedures or filling a prescription at an affordable price, can be difficultAs a result, Americans are often neglected by the health care system, whether or not by choice, and those who would otherwise be more proactive fail to access care due to the health care system’s inherent complexity.



Recognizing that these trends are not sustainable, Health Karma is focused on addressing these problems by providing solutions that shift healthcare from a one-size-fits all model to a more personalized experience built around each individual and each company - reducing and even removing layers of complexity that healthcare system brings. We believe that a new healthcare model, one that places the consumer at the center of the healthcare ecosystem, can help to improve their health care access while reducing what they pay for it.

To accomplish this, we developed Health Karma as a robust digital healthcare platform providing a single place for healthcare consumers and organizations to turn for personalized information, programs, and resources needed to understand, access, and manage their health and well-being. Focusing on the individual, Health Karma gives people information they need to access the right level of care from the start, when and where they need it, and provide ongoing support, thereby saving money for companies and their employees, while also improving care.
 

MediXall Group is reimagining how Americans access and afford care to give people a more consumer-centric way to manage their health & wellbeing: immediate, seamless, affordable, and tailored to their unique needs:
 

· | Easy and accessible healthcare – Making healthcare easy to understand and use through the entire health journey – from onboarding and monitoring to everyday use. Users can actively and confidently engage with their health anywhere, anytime they want and not just when it is convenient for the healthcare providers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Personalized health experience – Empowering users to take charge of their health and well-being through targeted health campaigns that come with relevant programs, resources and education.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Always-on service – Delivering immediate support to solve healthcare-related questions and address health-related concerns throughout the health experience.

We have engineered the Health Karma Platform to be scalable and to grow beyond its current offerings. The flexibility of the Platform enables us to seamlessly integrate and quickly launch new services, expand service offerings or enter new verticals in a cost- effective manner. This has enabled us to acquire and integrate synergistic offerings, such as Responders 1st Call™, Workers 1st Call & Report™, and Student 1st Call™ which help us better serve both our members and employer/organization clients.
 
MediXall Group is currently comprised of the following five solutions:
 
Health Karma – With Health Karma, we have created a unique membership model that provides consumers with convenient and affordable access to best-in-class care, whenever and wherever, while driving down overall healthcare costs. We provide our members access to licensed healthcare providers across a wide and growing spectrum of care through $0 copay virtual primary, urgent, behavioral, and pet care, as well as significant discounts to prescriptions, dental care, eye care, and hearing. For employers, our Health Karma membership offers a comprehensive way for them to offer supplemental health benefits to all of their employees, including part-time and gig workers, which include independent contractors, on-demand platform workers (ie Uber, Lyft, etc.), freelancer, and other temporary workers, who typically are not eligible for benefits. The Health Karma membership is also targeted for the small companies who cannot afford to provide health insurance to their employees as well as an adjunct for high-deductible health insurance plans.
Health Karma Behavioral Health – The behavioral health market has traditionally been underserved for a number of reasons, including as a result of inadequate access, a limited universe of qualified providers, high cost and social stigma. That is why we created Health Karma Behavioral to focus on providing mental health care exactly when and how is needed, instead of waiting six weeks for an appointment to see a psychiatrist. We believe this specialized offering for behavioral health can help to removes or reduces these burdens associated with traditional face-to-face mental health services by improving convenience through 24/7 access to our platform, providing more accessible entry level price points, and reducing associated stigmas by promoting easier access and preserving privacy. Health Karma Behavioral provides our members both the ability to speak to a therapist in-the moment they need it or schedule a call or video chat with a therapist within 24 hours.
Workers 1st Call & Report™ - Workers 1st Call & Report is a 24/7/365 pre-claim, preemptive solution to reduce work comp claims, costs, fraud and unnecessary and over-utilized case management. The program combines behavioral health consultations to mitigate the primary reasons injuries happen in the workplace which is distracted employees along with Registered Nurse triage to mitigate minor injuries from becoming a work comp claim integrated into an easy-to-access, plug-and-play program.
Responders 1st Call™ - Responders 1st Call is a confidential, anonymous in-the-moment 24/7/365 solution for First Responders to destress and digest traumatic situations which could lead to a work comp claim, disability, or suicide. This program provides in-the-moment consultations to the First Responder and their family to address work-related or personal, emotional, or behavioral health issues, or other issues interfering with responsibilities at work or home.
Student 1st Call™ - Student 1st Call is a solution for in the moment confidential access to master-level clinicians targeted for college age student population to help with depression, stress, sleep, addiction, relationship problems, anxiety, grief, and more. Our evidenced-based assessment and clinician-led consultation sets the student on a clear path for emotional support.
By bringing the Workers 1st Call, Responders 1st Call and Student 1st Call programs into the Health Karma ecosystem, we believe we are better positioned to meet the growing industry needs by allowing us to collectively build out our employer client base with more coverage options, enhance our distribution footprint, and strengthen our operational capacity to meet growing customer demands. With the addition of the 1st Call products, Health Karma is uniquely equipped to meet the growing needs of the Small to Medium Businesses, as well as individuals and families across the nation.
 
We believe the addition of these new programs will help to further enrich our membership model by creating a comprehensive and interconnected offering that delivers a virtuous circle of value for consumers, employers and partners.
 
We generate revenue from the membership payments of companies, organization memberships, and consumer subscription fees, which are typically a 12-month commitment in nature, providing significant revenue visibility. Through our per-membership-per-month (“PMPM”) subscription model, we enter into contracts with our employer customers that pay a fixed monthly rate based on the total number of Memberships. In most cases, Employees and their Dependents have unlimited access to our Platform and do not pay extra fees for increased utilization, unless they wish to access services outside the scope of those covered by the subscription.

We see exciting growth potential as we continue to attract new members through our existing offerings, launch new offerings to address more of the healthcare needs of consumers & employers, and improve Americans’ access to health while reducing what they pay for it. As we extend our platform, we believe that we can create multiple monetization opportunities at different stages of the consumer healthcare journey, enabling us to drive higher expected consumer lifetime value without significant additional consumer acquisition costs.
 
Focusing on the Underserved Small Employer and Individual Market
 
The primary reason the landscape of healthcare offerings has not evolved to solve this problem until recently is due to many companies solely focusing on creating solutions and businesses models targeting large self-insured employers and payors, leaving the small-to-midsize employer and individual market completely underserved.
 
Over the last 10 years, multiple generations of healthcare technology companies struggled to get lift-off and scale, not because their products and services weren’t transformative for this market, but because they failed to find an executable path for sustainable distribution and value capture. We believe the lack of maturity of the underlying distribution — has been arguably the most significant bottleneck in the adoption and growth of healthcare solutions for this market.
 
We believe there are three reasons why existing providers haven’t focused on this market. First, small and midsize businesses (SMBs), and individuals are fragmented and hard to reach. Relative to the value they bring in, the cost of reaching and serving them has traditionally been too high to warrant the effort unless you can sell multiple products to them. Second, there is significant signup friction for benefits and healthcare products. Lastly, benefits products can be costly for SMBs to offer to employees, which results in many just forgoing benefits altogether. The lack of access to simple, low-cost healthcare and benefits solutions has had a significant impact on the recruitment and retention efforts of SMBs and the well-being of their employees.
 But we believe where there is a gap, there is an opportunity. This is why we have put tremendous focus into building out a unique distribution engine that capitalizes on the current infrastructure of health insurance distribution and merges it with proven strategies from B2C and B2B2C from other industries.
 
Our Unique Distribution Engine 
 
Our Distribution is currently made up of five pillars:
 
Employer Groups 
 Providing health benefits to employees is costly, complicated, and time-consuming for SMBs. While larger organizations are starting to realize the cost of traditional group health insurance is becoming unsustainable, the annual rate hikes and increasing premium prices are even more of a concern for SMBs with smaller budgets to dedicate to their employees’ healthcare.
 
With fewer employees, SMBs also have a much harder time meeting a group health insurance plan’s minimum participation requirement. Whether they have a lot of employees still on their parents’ insurance, older employees who qualify for Medicare, or others who simply don’t want to participate in a group health plan, SMBs need a more flexible health benefits solution. The reliance on part-time employees and 1099 employees by SMBs also precludes those type of workers being eligible for health insurance. With Health Karma, we saw an opportunity to provide a comprehensive solution for SMBs brings many of the benefits, resources, tools, and advantages big companies have historically had. With Health Karma, we wanted SMB owners to be able to afford solutions that can make their employees healthier and happier.
 
With fewer tiers in the organization’s hierarchy and less people involved in the decision-making process, one of the benefits to working with SMBs is they generally have a much quicker buying process than larger employers. Health Karma is focused on 3 types of employers
 

· | Employers that don’t offer insurance or that have a high number of part time, 1099, or employees without social security numbers. These type of employees are in many cases their highest area of turnover, which costs a ton of money, but health insurance doesn’t consider those employees to be benefits eligible. And they likely have wanted to provide something, but health insurance is just too expensive anyway even if they were eligible.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Employers that offer health insurance coverage that have a high deductible. Most companies have had to increase deductibles year after year after year to battle the double-digit health insurance increases. So, a totally typical plan may have a $3,000 deductible for an individual and $6,000 deductible for family. You think that person that needs mental health counseling or a doctor’s visit is going to be rethinking if they even go because they will have to pay it all out of pocket and they still need to pay for gas, food and their rent and all that is going up. You don’t address things at the initial level, and they turn into a crisis which results in lost work time and productivity and more expense for the employer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Employers that have high Workers Comp claims. According to the National Safety Council, in the United States in 2021, a worker is injured on the job every 7 seconds. This equates to 7 million work injuries per year and a total cost of over $160 billion. Approximately 70% of workplace injuries are minor and do not need clinical intervention. Overextension, slip, trip, falls, contact with equipment account for 86% of workplace injuries. This issue is compounded by the number of fraudulent injuries exacerbated by aggressive litigators. If work comp fraud were a legitimate business, it would rank among Fortune 500 companies. SMB have limited resources to address the injured worker other than sending them to urgent care or ER regardless of the severity of the injury. Plus, the required work comp state regulatory and OSHA injury reports pose a significant burden on the smaller businesses with no risk insurance personnel.

Health Insurance Brokers & General Agencies
 Most employers do not manage benefits selection alone—thousands of licensed and trained insurance brokers serve as trusted advisors to small and large businesses, helping employers and their employees navigate the complexity of benefits. According to MetLife’s 15th Annual U.S. Employee Benefits Trend Study, over 80% of small and midsize businesses work with insurance brokers to manage their benefits. These insurance brokers serve as a key intermediary between insurance carriers seeking to access a widely dispersed SMB population, which often lacks dedicated personnel and technology budgets to fully self-direct critical benefit decisions. They play a crucial role in educating SMBs about their health benefit options. Health insurance brokers and agents are experts in helping their clients select the right set of products.
 
When it comes to the selling, education and distribution of health benefits (can include health, dental, life and other types of insurance) to small employers, mid-size employers, individuals, associations and some large employers it is that insurance broker who is providing that key role. The broker is talking to the business owner and the human resources team to sell or renew policies and adjust and make changes according to the needs. Often a relationship has been built over many years and that company relies on their broker for advice each year on their benefit package. In addition, there are brokers attempting to expand their business and they are looking for unique benefits to help them get access to a new client. Many employers won’t add an additional health benefit without discussing it first with their broker.
 
This is why health insurance brokers are a key pillar to our distribution, as they provide an immense expansion of our sales efforts with our Health Karma and our Workers 1st and Responders 1st call solutions. To accelerate the expansion of our health insurance broker relationships, we also look to partner with General Agencies. These organizations provide brokers the administrative support, product education and home base to build up their business. By partnering with the organization, we are able to access 100s and sometimes 1000s of brokers without having to onboard and train each one individually.
 
We believe we have built a robust and extensive partnership network in the health insurance industry with distribution agreements with many leading insurance agencies in their respective states, such as BHC Insurance, the third largest independent insurance agency in Arkansas, and Gem State Financial, a leading Idaho-based General Agency. We have been able to increase the reach of our partnership network through an Affinity Marketing Partnership agreement with the National Association of Health Underwriters, a professional association representing more than 100,000 health insurance agents, benefits professionals, consultants, and brokers, from both small and large health insurance companies throughout the United States. The Partnership enables NAHU brokers to market the Health Membership in combination with various insurance products or self-insured plans. This expands NAHU members’ ability to work with organizations to provide additional benefits for employees with customized membership options to enhance existing benefits packages or to open the door to benefits for non-traditional, gig and part-time workers.

Associations, Chambers, Other membership organizations
 Associations, Chambers of Commerce and other types of organizations are a large driver of our distribution engine, as it enables us to drive significant reach to very targeted member populations. These organizations look to drive revenue in two ways, through member dues and “non due” revenue. Health Karma can help increase both. Associations and other membership organizations will enter into agreements with us to offer Health Karma to their own end-user customers or members as a benefit, a reward or a component of a loyalty program. In addition to helping increase member dues, Health Karma also becomes a new source of non-due revenue through a revenue share on new membership driven through the organization.
 
Municipalities and Public Service Departments
 According to the National League of Cities data, there are 36,000 municipalities and local governments in the United States, of which 18,700 are municipalities of less than 50,000 lives, 16,360 are town and townships, and 4,031 are county governments. These smaller municipalities and governments are dealing with the same issues and pain points as with smaller companies; namely many 1099, part-timers and other employees with limited health benefits, issues in dealing with workplace injuries and work comp claims, fraud, and reporting requirements. Our Health Karma and Workers 1st Call solutions address these issues and pain points.
 
When you look at Public Service Departments and the First Responder market, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there are over 800,000 law enforcement officers in the US; according to the US National Fire Department registry there are 1.2 million fire fighters of which 795,00 are volunteer; according to the National Association of State EMS Officials, there are 219,000 EMS professionals, and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are approximately 400,000 correction officers in the US; represented by 75,000 departments or organizations. This represents the market opportunity for Responders 1st Call to mitigate trauma, PTSD, disability and suicide ideations for our First Responders. And this does not include the 800,000 ER nurses and doctors according to Zippia Emergency Room Statistics and the NIH, plus the 2 million active and reserve military according to Defense Department personnel data and over 2 million retired military according to Statista 2023 . who can benefit from the virtual technology embedded in our Responders 1st Call product which is an effective treatment for trauma and PTSD.
 
Colleges and Universities
 According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), there are approximately 6,000 colleges and universities in the US of which 4,000 are degree-granting institutions. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, undergrad enrollments in 2021 were 17.5 million representing a decline of almost 10% after the pandemic. Further almost 600 institutions have closed over the last 3 years. With the effects of the pandemic retention and recruitment is a critical issue for higher education along with the increasing concern on how to support the mental and emotional well-being of their student population.
Our Market Opportunity
 
Since inception, we have been focused on changing the way consumers access, interact with and consume healthcare. In the United States, healthcare spending grew to $4.1 trillion in 2020 and is expected to reach $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. However, it is not always clear what the employer group or individual consumer receives in return for this massive spending. We believe that a new healthcare model, one that places the consumer at the center of the healthcare ecosystem, can help to improve their health care access while reducing what they pay for it.

Evolving Attitudes Among Consumers and Employers Towards Virtual Medicine

Supported by increasing deregulation and broad societal shifts, demand for and provision of virtual medical and behavioral health services is surging. Telehealth enables more efficient allocation and utilization of existing clinical resources that could otherwise go unused. With an aging population requiring more complex care and a younger generation that is accustomed to digital technology, telehealth offers an efficient way to leverage finite resources. In the coming years, the telehealth market is positioned for significant growth. The demand for telehealth services is clear among younger generations. According to a survey by Harmony Healthcare IT, three out of four millennials would rather search for medical advice online versus seeing a doctor in-person. These younger generations represent the future of the healthcare system, and telehealth can be at the center of their care experience.
 
Healthcare is a Top Priority for Employers
 
To attract and retain staff, employers are looking to make significant investments in health benefits; yet, as commercial insurance costs have reached record highs, employers and employees remain frustrated. Barriers to accessing timely care during the day and after business hours cause employees to miss work and lose productivity. As a result, many employees self-direct themselves to higher cost settings such as emergency rooms. Efficient healthcare needs to be available 24/7/365 from anywhere that employee happens to be.
 
Rising health care costs are causing many employers to question whether they can afford to offer health benefits to their employees. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2021 Employer Health Benefits Survey, it costs up to $21,804 each year for employer-sponsored family health coverage for covered workers in small firms.
 
As costs continue to rise, a common way to offset them is to adjust benefits, such as increasing deductibles or copays, lowering coinsurance and increasing out-of-pocket limits. At a certain point, when the benefits become too lean, employees’ perception of their benefits deteriorates.

Health Insurance is Tailored to Large Enterprises not Small Businesses
 
In November 2021, Americans quit jobs at a record pace with about 4.5 million workers quitting their jobs, the most since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started publishing the data in 2000. In the "Great Resignation," small businesses face an uphill battle for labor. Some employees are leaving for better pay and benefits, while some are leaving the workforce and relying on government programs.
 
Small business owners are still managing the reality that the number of job openings exceeds the number of unemployed workers, producing a tight labor market. In the January 2022 Jobs Report survey from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), 47% of independent businesses said they had job openings they struggled to fill, which far exceeds the 48-year historical average of 23%. Moreover, 50% of small business owners reported raising compensation in part to stay competitive as employers and attract applicants to their open position, which is another 48-year record high reading.
 
Small businesses — defined as 500 employees or less by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) — are a key part of economic growth and job creation in the United States. The US Small Business Administration said in 2019 that they accounted for two-thirds of net new jobs. According to the SBA 2021 Small Business Profile, there are over 32 million small business in the US, making up 99.9% of all US businesses and providing employment for 61.2 million Americans. More jobs are also traditionally created by small businesses and new company formation than by large corporations, with small companies creating 1.5 million jobs annually which accounts for 64% of new jobs, according to the Small Business Administration.
 
Small businesses, like their larger counterparts, have not been shielded from the increasing cost of health care. Without advantages such as a larger pool of insured employees, more bargaining power with health insurance companies, and the benefit of full-time human resources personnel, small-business owners are often left with little recourse and few options when a health insurance carrier hikes costs. In addition, many small employers have been hanging on during the pandemic and are just starting to rebound. They may not be able to afford full insurance, but they need their employees to stay, as turnover is costly.
 
The Rise of the Independent Worker, Freelancer, and 1099 (Changing Workforce)
 
With the slow transition away from traditional employment and rise of independent labor over the past decade, the U.S. economy has experienced a significant shift in how employees choose to work. The pandemic has served as a catalyst for deeper change with respect to Americans’ embrace of the gig economy. The gig economy is characterized by short-term, flexible jobs that businesses offer to freelancers and independent contractors instead of traditional, full-time employees. What seemed like a gradual uptick in interest for freelance and gig work up until 2019 has now exploded into the mainstream.
 
While approximately 156 million Americans, about half the U.S. population, gets health insurance through an employer, now more than one-third of the workforce works in the gig economy full- or part-time, according to Upwork’s study of the U.S. independent workforce, “Freelance Forward:2020.” Covid-19 only accelerated this trend towards the gig economy with Upwork’s data showing that 12% of workers started freelancing during the pandemic. And there may be no turning back; 60% of people who had taken up freelancing reported that no amount of money would convince them to take a traditional job again.
 
The pandemic also magnified the fundamental problems in the traditional employer benefit system for Americans. People who lost their jobs and took up independent work were forced to find their own benefits or go without coverage during the pandemic. Today, nearly 70 million Americans, representing more than one-third of the total U.S. workforce earn income as freelancers and that figure is expected to swell to 90 million to by 2028, according to Statistica. Despite the trend however, this group of people are underserved compared to W2 full-time employees. The challenge of accessing benefits isn’t just limited to independent workers either. Many employees, particularly part-time employees, do not have access to benefits through their employers. As of January 2022, the Bureau of Labor Statics reported over 25 million part-time workers are in the US. With this changing workforce, the needs of independent and part-time workers will only become more central in the U.S.

We believe there is a significant opportunity to solve these challenges through affordable easy-to access online solutions to health and wellcare, such as ours, that matches consumer demand, offering health plans and employers an attractive, cost-effective healthcare alternative for their beneficiaries, and addressing pain points such as work comp claims and costs. We believe that MediXall Group provides solutions to address these challenges.
 
Health Karma Platform
 
At MediXall Group, we empower consumers—both individual consumers and SMBs—to make smarter healthcare decisions with confidence via our digital platform. Technology has changed the way consumers manage their healthcare, making them more comfortable with comparing and accessing healthcare services online.

By seamlessly integrating best-in-class providers into one Platform, users get the same, consistent user experience, without fumbling for passwords across multiple programs or struggling to remember where to access each benefit. Built as a modular solution Health Karma can scale up depending on the unique needs of each member or employer customer by adding programs over time.

Complete Solution to Manage the Consumer Healthcare Journey
 
Health Karma offers a simple and intuitive consumer experience that enables our users to take control of their health care decisions.
 
That experience begins with trust and engagement, which we earn by providing our users with features that help them navigate the many disconnected elements of the healthcare ecosystem. When our users adopt these tools, we not only streamline their day-to-day interactions with the healthcare system and improve user satisfaction, but we also obtain valuable data that enables a better understanding of their unique health care needs. Trust, engagement, and personalized data allow us to guide our users to the providers that can give them the right care, including virtual care, at the right time and right cost. Our technology stack will also permit us to offer personalized insights and benefits. Our ability to deliver a high-value product, in turn, creates more trust, engagement, and in time, enhances our ability to provide personalized, data-driven insights.



An important aspect of our approach to building trust and engaging members is to engage with them through whatever channel is most comfortable for them. Whether it is a secure in-app message to answer coverage and benefit questions, a consultation with a licensed medical provider in the middle of the night through our telehealth offering, talking immediately with a licensed, behavioral health clinician 24/7/365 to address common emotional well-being and behavioral health concerns, we are there for our users when they need us most. In this way, we are building a consumer-centric experience more similar to what consumers experience from a best-in-class technology or consumer products company than from a traditional health care organization.

Our Growth Opportunities
 
Expand clients and B2B offering. We expect to meaningfully expand our B2B channel through both the addition of new employer and group clients, as well as a focus on driving deeper penetration rates within our existing clients. We plan to add new B2B clients by contracting with additional regional and national general insurance agencies, accelerating our outbound marketing efforts, leveraging our broker and consultant relationships and continuing to penetrate the massively underserved part-time, independent, and the smaller employer worker market. Additionally, we are focused on further developing our dedicated internal B2B sales team solely focused on expanding our B2B client base across our different verticals as well as driving penetration within existing contracts by cross-sales with our various MediXall Group solutions –an effort we expect to drive significant traction within the near-term. Within our existing employer base, we plan to drive penetration and engagement with an invested focus on client success. Additionally, because of our embedded position serving the B2B customer base, we believe we are well-positioned to innovate and lay the groundwork for additional services that drive value for their members such as navigation across the ever-changing health and wellness landscape.
 
Continue expanding B2C user base through Associations and increase engagement. Through our expanding client base of associations and performance marketing initiatives drive penetration with these associations, we will continue to focus on growing consumer member acquisition and activation. We expect this strategy to be further complemented by sustained investment in our platform capabilities, as well as through continuing to leverage our growing brand awareness. We believe our growth opportunity in both health and wellness to be substantial. In addition, as a result of the end-to-end nature of our platform, we believe we are well-positioned to create care continuity for our members across a broader range of health and wellness verticals. We plan to drive further engagement of our existing member base by expanding our offerings beyond our current programs to include capabilities such as enhanced behavioral and emotional well-being offerings, wearable (i.e. Apple Watch, FitBit) integration, Wellness challenges and rewards, and medical records transfer in order to drive higher member lifetime engagement and value. We use a strategic and disciplined approach to scaling our marketing budget, as we believe we are able to achieve efficient spend levels on a per-customer basis by leveraging the Health Karma brand, the breadth of our MediXall Group solutions, and strong relationships with outbound and inbound marketing channels.

Opportunistic M&A and Product Development. We are well positioned to further expand our solution set through opportunistic acquisitions or product development responsive to the evolving and expanding needs of our client base. Our technology platform is built to easily integrate with non-native technologies and to offer a single cohesive platform. We plan to use a disciplined approach to strategically acquire complementary capabilities and service lines. These may include, but are not limited to, healthcare FinTech platforms, Third-party data providers, wellness and coaching platforms, workers comp solutions, and other virtual behavioral and care coordination platforms.
 
MediXall Group Technology
 
The underlying technology for MediXall Group is a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface or API-driven technology platform. This enables the platform to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services, technologies and functionality that we have introduced through strategic partnerships.
 
Our platform is built on a modern cloud-based technology stack, employing Agile development cycles and a DevOps approach to infrastructure. This approach allows us to evolve and improve our platform at a faster pace than using a traditional software development and infrastructure management process. Our technology platform is updated frequently, without long upgrade cycles. Our modular, service-oriented architecture utilizes API standards for ease of implementing new functionalities and integrating with external systems. By designing our product as a platform, we have created an overarching infrastructure where consumer data, preferences, and third-party partners can all interact through Health Karma’s API. Data is the heart of our technology so because of this we have the potential to integrate machine learning and natural language processing to automate recommendations and workflows, uncovering insights that we can incorporate back into the design platform.
 
This enables our platform to act as a sales channel for other companies. We can deliver other’s state-of-the-art technology and applications through our platform. Similar to other two-sided marketplaces, the platform can bring innovative new products to consumers and employers, while at the same time opening up distribution and revenue opportunities for other health companies. Furthermore, we believe that this will generate a virtuous cycle, leveraging our growing customer base to attract the best healthcare partners (and vice versa)-increasing value for all stakeholders.
 
Our proprietary technology platform powers all aspects of our company: engaging members, supporting partners, and advancing business objectives. Our technology is grounded in human-centered design thinking and leverages insights from behavioral interaction. Our product designers and engineers collaborate closely with our operational team members, as well as healthcare advisors and partners in the Health Karma Network to observe and then optimize workflows. We employ user testing and experiment-driven design (such as A/B testing) to enhance our member and partner experiences.
 
With the opportunities and growth trajectory in front of the company, we believe our skilled internal development team is uniquely positioned to make critical real-time product development decisions, enabling us to be responsive and stay ahead of the competition.

We support our sales force in several ways, including through account-based marketing resources and the deployment of a business development team to educate employer decision makers on the benefits of offering Health Karma to their employees. We also leverage sales analytics to further support lead generation. Additionally, our account management and client success team actively manages our customer accounts, provides in-depth support, and cross-sells the client to other MediXall Group solutions which address their pain points.

Consumer Sales & Marketing 
 
When we market and sell directly to individuals, we initially plan to focus on increasing brand awareness, followed by performance marketing targeted toward user acquisition, activation and engagement.
 
Our marketing strategy in new markets is primarily centered on increasing overall brand awareness, familiarity, consideration and ultimately enrollment. We have carefully developed a robust marketing plan to achieve these objectives:
 

· | SEO, Social & Traditional - We will drive brand awareness and conversions to our platform using social media marketing via Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and others. In addition, we plan to leverage SEO & SEM (Search Engine Optimization & Search Engine Marketing) to enhance MediXall Group’s search presence both organically and paid.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Content Marketing - We consistently release marketing content through our blog that aims to educate our audience about the value that our services provides. We also develop thought leadership content such as whitepapers, eBooks, and infographics and use public relations to secure earned media placements. Our content marketing efforts aim to influence and persuade readers without having to rely solely on conventional direct selling tactics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Influencer Marketing - We will launch an initiative to guest blog articles and features in healthcare, personal finance, and startup tech publications like TechCrunch, Wired, VentureBeat, and other outlets in our industry. Additionally, we participate in industry conferences, and may partner with media outlets, event venues, local businesses, and social media influencers to increase brand awareness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As brand awareness increases in more established markets, we shift our efforts to performance marketing focused on both customer acquisition and engagement. Our performance marketing initiatives include customized task-based in-app messages and email communications to drive engagement among members, in addition to more targeted advertisements through direct mail, Google Search, YouTube and social media for member acquisition.
 
Customer and Client Services and Support
 
We believe that because our clients and employer customers bear an enormous responsibility to successfully run their businesses day in and day out, they welcome our support to provide end-to-end customer support, including full profile data conversion and import, live onboarding and technical support via telephone, email, and screen sharing; in-software self-service tools; advanced professional services; and educational events. Our dedicated support team is focused on seeking to ensure that every MediXall Group member has the best possible experience.
Customer & Client Onboarding. We onboard new customers and partners with live training sessions delivered via telephone and web conference. These trainings are supplemented by self- service setup checklists, online help materials and webinars.
Customer & Client Success. To identify opportunities for greater adoption of our products and services and to further help our customers be more successful on our platform, we engage with them to better understand their business goals, objectives, and pain points; provide targeted education about relevant features, products and services as well as business best practices; and develop a recommended success plan with periodic outreach to check in on their progress.
Ongoing Customer Support. Inclusive with being a member of the Health Karma Partner Program, we offer customer service and support via phone, chat, emails and self-help knowledge centers. All customer service and support is provided by our in-house personnel who are invested in MediXall Group’s core values and are closely connected to our Product, Technology and Experience team.

Competition 
 
While we believe there are currently no direct competitors that offer the full suite of solutions as we do, there are several companies that offer components of telehealth or address conditions that compete with our solutions. These include companies whose primary business is providing and marketing telehealth and health and wellness management, such as the delivery of on-demand access to healthcare and wellness services. We compete with other providers that are larger in scale and generally provide telehealth on behalf of self-insured employers and insurance plans. Within parts of the behavioral health market, we also compete with public and private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers. Competition focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated services, operational experience, customer support, extent of customer base, and reputation.
Regulatory Environment
 
Participants in the health care industry are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations in the United States at the federal and state levels as well as applicable international laws. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the Unites States, both at the federal and state level, which could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. We have attempted to structure our operations to comply with applicable legal requirements, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Healthcare Reform
 
Our business could be affected by changes in health care laws, including without limitation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which was enacted in March 2010. The ACA has changed how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of individuals, changes in Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. Ongoing government and legislative initiatives may bring about other changes.
 
While most of the provisions of the ACA and other health care reform legislation will not be directly applicable to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers, which may in turn affect our business. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of the ACA, any amendment or repeal of the ACA, or other health care reform on our business model, financial condition, or results of operations, negative changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure may negatively impact our business.
 
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
 
U.S.- HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. There are many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. Additionally, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Any health plan customers, as well as health care clearinghouses and certain providers with which we may have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which became effective on February 17, 2010, significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” who are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are considered a “business associate” to our customers and thus are directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with it. Such agreements must, among other things, require us to:

· | limit how we will use and disclose the protected health information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;
· | enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information; 
· | report security incidents, breaches and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and, 
· | assist the customer in question with certain duties under the privacy standards. 

 
In addition to HIPAA regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices and laws that place specific requirements on use of data. Such state laws can be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA, in which case we must comply with the more stringent law. As a result, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations in order to ensure we are in compliance with the stricter state laws.

Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA, we must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to our contractual partners within 60 days of discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Under the GDPR, the data controller is required to report personal data breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach.
 
We have implemented and maintained physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data and have processes in place to assist it in complying with all applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements regarding the protection of these data and properly responding to any security breaches or incidents. However, we cannot be sure that these safeguards are adequate to protect all personal data or to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal data and responding to any security breaches or incidents. Furthermore, in many cases, applicable state laws, including breach notification requirements, are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thereby complicating our compliance efforts. Additionally, state and federal laws regarding deceptive practices may apply to public assurances we give to individuals about the security of services we provide on behalf of our contractual customers.
 
Other Healthcare Regulations
 
In addition to data privacy laws, our operations and arrangements with healthcare professionals, clients, and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including without limitation fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; civil and criminal false claims laws; physician transparency laws; and state laws regarding the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing operations, and our interactions with healthcare professionals. We continually monitor legislative, regulatory and judicial developments related to licensure and engagement arrangements with professionals; however, new agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could require us to change how we operate, may increase our costs of services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and health care provider information. Some states also are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
 
In addition to HIPAA regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices and laws that place specific requirements on use of data. Such state laws can be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA, in which case we must comply with the more stringent law. As a result, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations in order to ensure we are in compliance with the stricter state laws.
