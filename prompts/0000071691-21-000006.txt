ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
The New York Times Company (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 26, 1896, under the laws of the State of New York. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “our” and “us.”
We are a global media organization focused on creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information. Our continued commitment to premium content and journalistic excellence makes The New York Times brand a trusted source of news and information for readers and viewers across various platforms. The quality of our coverage has been widely recognized with many industry and peer accolades, including 130 Pulitzer Prizes and citations, more than any other news organization.
The Company includes our digital and print products and related businesses. We have one reportable segment with businesses that include:
•our core news product, The New York Times (“The Times”), which is available on our mobile applications, on our website (NYTimes.com) and as a printed newspaper, and associated content such as our podcasts;
•our other interest-specific products, including Games (previously Crossword), Cooking and Audm (our read-aloud audio service), which are available on mobile applications and websites, and Wirecutter, our online review and recommendation product; and
•our related businesses, such as our licensing operations; our creative services associated with our branded content studio; our commercial printing operations; our live events business; and other products and services under The Times brand.
We generate revenues principally from subscriptions and advertising. Subscription revenues consist of revenues from subscriptions to our digital and print products (which include our news product, as well as our Games, Cooking and Audm products) and single-copy and bulk sales of our print products. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of our advertising products and services. Revenue information for the Company appears under “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
We believe that the significant growth in subscriptions to our products demonstrates the success of our “subscription-first” strategy and the willingness of our readers to pay for high-quality journalism. We had approximately 7.5 million paid subscriptions to our products as of December 27, 2020, more than at any point in our history. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY – P. 1


During 2020, we continued to make significant investments in our journalism and our digital products, while taking further steps to position our organization to operate effectively in a digital environment. The Times continued to break stories, produce investigative reports and help our audience understand a wide range of topics, including the Covid-19 pandemic and its many reverberations, a national reckoning over race and social justice, and the U.S. presidential election and its aftermath. We made significant investments in our newsroom, including capabilities in live, visual and data journalism, and in audio, including our highly popular news podcast, The Daily, which was downloaded 1.25 billion times in 2020. In addition, we acquired Serial Productions, the company that produces the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast, and Audm, which transforms long-form journalism into audio. In addition, we continue to innovate digital advertising solutions, including our first-party data products, which allow the Company to leverage its large and coveted audiences in privacy-forward ways.
Our business was affected in 2020 and may be further affected by the conditions, including significant economic disruption, market volatility and uncertainty, caused by the global coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and attempts to contain it. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
PRODUCTS
The Company’s principal business consists of distributing content generated by The Times newsroom through our digital and print platforms. In addition, we distribute selected content on third-party platforms. 
Since 2011, we have charged consumers for content provided on our core news website (NYTimes.com) and mobile applications. Digital subscriptions can be purchased individually or through group corporate or group education subscriptions. Our access model generally offers users who have registered free access to a limited number of articles before requiring users to subscribe for access to additional content. We have made the choice at times to suspend limits on registered users' free access to particularly important coverage.
In addition to subscriptions to our digital news product, we offer standalone subscriptions to our Games, Cooking and Audm products. (In the first quarter of 2020, we acquired a company that transforms journalism articles into audio that is made available in a subscription-based product named “Audm.”) Certain digital news subscription packages include access to our Games and Cooking products. 
Our products also include podcasts, which are distributed both on our digital platforms and on third-party platforms. We generate advertising and licensing revenue from this content, but do not charge users for access.
The Times’s print edition newspaper, published seven days a week in the United States, commenced publication in 1851. The Times also has an international edition that is tailored for global audiences. First published in 2013, the international edition succeeded the International Herald Tribune, a leading daily newspaper that commenced publishing in Paris in 1887. Our print newspapers are sold in the United States and around the world through individual home-delivery subscriptions, bulk subscriptions (primarily by schools and hotels) and single-copy sales. Print home-delivery subscribers are entitled to receive free access to some of our digital products.
SUBSCRIPTIONS AND AUDIENCE
Our content reaches a broad audience through both digital and print platforms. As of December 27, 2020, we had approximately 7,523,000 paid subscriptions across 232 countries and territories to our digital and print products. 
Paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 6,690,000 as of December 27, 2020, an increase of approximately 52% compared with December 29, 2019. This amount includes standalone paid subscriptions to our Games, Cooking and Audm products, which totaled approximately 840,000, 726,000 and 34,000, respectively, as of December 27, 2020. International digital-only news subscriptions represented approximately 18% of our digital-only news subscriptions as of December 27, 2020.
The number of paid digital-only subscriptions also includes estimated group corporate and group education subscriptions (which collectively represent approximately 4% of total paid digital subscriptions to our news products). The number of paid group subscriptions is derived using the value of the relevant contract and a discounted subscription rate. The actual number of users who have access to our products through group subscriptions is substantially higher.

In the United States, The Times had the largest daily and Sunday print circulation of all seven-day newspapers for the six-month period ended September 30, 2020, according to data collected by the Alliance for Audited Media (“AAM”), an independent agency that audits circulation of most U.S. newspapers and magazines.
For the fiscal year ended December 27, 2020, The Times’s average print circulation (which includes paid and qualified circulation of the newspaper in print) was approximately 374,000 for weekday (Monday to Friday) and 854,000 for Sunday. (Under AAM’s reporting guidance, qualified circulation represents copies available for individual consumers that are either non-paid or paid by someone other than the individual, such as copies delivered to schools and colleges and copies purchased by businesses for free distribution.)
Average circulation for the international edition of our newspaper (which includes paid circulation of the newspaper in print and electronic replica editions) for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2020, and December 29, 2019, was approximately 105,000 (estimated) and 164,000, respectively. These figures follow the guidance of Office de Justification de la Diffusion, an agency based in Paris and a member of the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations that audits the circulation of most newspapers and magazines in France. For 2020, this guidance excludes data from March through June 2020 in the calculation of annual average. The final 2020 figure will not be available until April 2021.
According to comScore Media Metrix, an online audience measurement service, in 2020, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 118 million unique visitors in the United States on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices. Globally, including the United States, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 166 million unique visitors on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices, according to internal data estimates. 
ADVERTISING 
We have a comprehensive portfolio of advertising products and services. Advertising revenue is principally from advertisers (such as technology, financial and luxury goods companies) promoting products, services or brands on digital platforms in the form of display ads, audio and video, and in print, in the form of column-inch ads. 
The majority of our advertising revenue is derived from offerings sold directly to marketers by our advertising sales teams. A smaller proportion of our total advertising revenues is generated through programmatic auctions run by third-party advertising exchanges. 
Digital advertising includes our core digital advertising business and other digital advertising. Our core digital advertising includes direct-sold website, mobile application, podcast, email and video advertisements. Other digital advertising includes advertising revenues generated by open-market programmatic advertising; creative services; Wirecutter, our review and recommendation product; and classified advertising. In 2020, digital advertising represented approximately 58% of our advertising revenues.
Print advertising includes revenue from column-inch ads and classified advertising, including line-ads as well as preprinted advertising, also known as freestanding inserts. Column-inch ads are priced according to established rates, with premiums for color and positioning, and classified advertising is paid for on a per-line basis. The Times newspaper had the largest market share in 2020 in print advertising among a national newspaper set that consists of USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Times, according to MediaRadar, an independent agency that measures advertising sales volume. In 2020, print advertising represented approximately 42% of our advertising revenues.
Our business is affected in part by seasonal patterns in advertising, with generally higher advertising volume in the fourth quarter due to holiday advertising.

COMPETITION
Our digital and print products compete for subscriptions and advertising with other media in their respective markets. Competition for subscription revenue and audience is generally based upon content breadth, depth, originality, quality and timeliness; product experience; format; price and access model; visibility on search engines and social media platforms and in mobile app stores; and service, while competition for advertising is generally based upon audience levels and demographics, advertising rates, service, targeting capabilities, advertising results and breadth of advertising offerings.
As our industry continues to shift from print to digital media, our products face competition for audience, subscriptions and advertising from a wide variety of digital media (many of which are free to users), including news and other information websites and mobile applications, news aggregators, sites that cover niche content, social media platforms, podcast distributors, and other forms of media. In addition, we compete for advertising on digital advertising networks and exchanges with real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels. 
Our digital news product most directly competes for audience, subscriptions and advertising with other U.S. and global news and information websites, mobile applications and digital products, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, BBC News, Vox, Buzzfeed, NPR, The Guardian and Financial Times. Our digital news product also competes with customized news feeds, news aggregators and social media products by companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter. Our audio journalism competes for audience and advertising with content from Spotify, NPR and others, and for audience with content in Apple’s products.
Our print newspaper competes for subscriptions and advertising primarily with the print editions of national newspapers such as The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal; newspapers of general circulation in New York City and its suburbs; other daily and weekly newspapers in markets in which The Times is circulated; and some national news and lifestyle magazines. The international edition of our newspaper competes with international sources of English-language news, including the Financial Times, Time, Bloomberg Business Week and The Economist, as well as pan-regional publications. 
OTHER BUSINESSES
We also derive revenue from other businesses, which primarily include:
•The Company’s licensing of our intellectual property. Our licensing division transmits articles, graphics and photographs from The Times and other publications to over 1,500 clients, including newspapers, magazines and websites in 100 countries and territories worldwide. The licensing division also handles digital archive distribution, which licenses electronic databases to resellers in the business, professional and library markets; magazine licensing; news digests; book development and rights and permissions. In addition, the Company licenses select content to third-party digital platforms for access by their users. Finally, the Company licenses content for use in, and collaborates with third parties in the development and production of, television and films;
•Wirecutter, a review and recommendation product that serves as a guide to technology gear, home products and other consumer goods. This product generates affiliate referral revenue (revenue generated by offering direct links to merchants in exchange for a portion of the sale price upon completion of a transaction); 
•The Company’s commercial printing operations, which utilize excess capacity at our College Point facility to print and distribute products for third parties; and
•The Company’s live events business, which hosts physical and virtual live events to connect audiences with our journalists and outside thought leaders, and is monetized through sponsorship and advertising.

PRINT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
The Times is currently printed at our production and distribution facility in College Point, N.Y., as well as under contract at 24 remote print sites across the United States. We also utilize excess capacity at our College Point facility for commercial printing and distribution for third parties. The Times is delivered to newsstands and retail outlets in the New York metropolitan area through a combination of third-party wholesalers and our own drivers. In other markets in the United States and Canada, The Times is delivered through agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents.
The international edition of The Times is printed under contract at 26 sites throughout the world and is sold in over 130 countries and territories. It is distributed through agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents.
RAW MATERIALS
The primary raw materials we use are newsprint and coated paper, which we purchase from a number of North American and European producers. A significant portion of our newsprint is purchased from Resolute FP US Inc., a subsidiary of Resolute Forest Products Inc., a large global manufacturer of paper, market pulp and wood products.
In 2020 and 2019, we used the following types and quantities of paper:

(In metric tons) | 2020 | 2019
Newsprint(1) | 71,600 | | 93,300
Coated and Supercalendered Paper(2) | 10,200 | | 13,200

(1) Newsprint usage includes paper used for commercial printing.
(2) The Times uses a mix of coated and supercalendered paper for The New York Times Magazine, and coated paper for T: The New York
Times Style Magazine.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our ability to attract, develop and maximize the contributions of world-class talent, and to create the conditions for our people to do their best work, is vital to the continued success of our mission and business and central to our long-term strategy. As we continue to transform the Company and foster a culture that enables our mission and people to thrive, we are focused on building a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace and workforce that reflects the society that we report on; providing competitive compensation packages and otherwise incentivizing employees in unique and attractive ways; developing and promoting talent; and supporting the health, safety and well-being of our employees. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The New York Times is driven by a simple but powerful mission: to seek the truth and help people understand the world. The diversity of our staff helps to make our news report deeper and richer, and better able to address the needs and experiences of our growing, global audience.
Since 2017, we have published annually a report on diversity and inclusion to provide transparency in the composition of our workforce, and recently published a more detailed report and plan of action focused on transforming our culture and strengthening our systems and practices for developing and supporting our workforce. We have also taken a number of steps over the years to advance our diversity, equity and inclusion goals, including:
•Building clear, fair and intentional processes for hiring, including requirements for recruiting diverse slates of job candidates;
•Conducting a pay equity analysis every two years to ensure that employees from traditionally under-represented groups are not adversely impacted by pay bias, as well as regularly reviewing and benchmarking pay against external market data;
•Continuing to invest in diversifying the pipeline of future journalists at both The Times and the broader industry, by creating and expanding programs like The New York Times Fellowship Program, a one-year

work program for up-and-coming journalists, hosting an annual Student Journalism Institute for journalists of color, and supporting many outside organizations dedicated to increasing diversity in journalism, technology and the media;
•Fostering an inclusive workplace through, among other things, sponsoring 11 employee resource groups for people who share identities and interests and expanding trainings on unconscious bias and leading diverse teams; and 
•Adopting policies, processes and guidelines to promote productive, effective and respectful communications with employees.
Talent and Development 
Recognizing the critical importance of executive leadership to the success of the Company, the Board of Directors works with senior management to ensure that effective plans are in place for both short-term and long-term executive succession at the Company. The Board conducts annually a detailed review of the Company’s talent strategies, leadership pipeline and succession plans for key senior leadership roles. After a deliberate succession planning process, led by our Chairman and Publisher of The New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, and the Presiding Director, Brian P. McAndrews, the Board appointed Meredith Kopit Levien from within the organization to be the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective September 2020. We also value ongoing development and continuous learning and strive to support and provide learning opportunities to our employees to invest in their career growth. 
Compensation and Benefits
We offer a comprehensive compensation and benefits program designed to attract and maximize the contributions of talented individuals. The goal of this program is to meet the needs of our employees, support our strategic goals, mission and values, drive a high-performance culture, and pay competitively and equitably. In line with our business goals, our compensation philosophy links compensation to achieving sustained high performance and creating long-term stockholder value. 
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical and mental health, safety, well-being and work-life balance of our employees is vital to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial and mental well-being for all of our employees. During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, we assembled a broad, cross-functional team to lead and coordinate the Company’s overall response, including to support employees during an extended period of working from home and consider how our policies and practices around remote and distributed work should evolve. Among other things, we expanded remote work, established specialized employee engagement and feedback initiatives, broadened benefit offerings and took early action in implementing protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees, many of whom were reporting on the frontlines of the pandemic. In addition, we introduced dependent care relief, an office supply reimbursement and ergonomic resources, mental health and wellness support, and a one-off bonus to all employees other than senior-most leaders to recognize their outstanding efforts and support them with any additional financial needs stemming from the pandemic.
Workforce Demographics
We had approximately 4,700 full-time equivalent employees as of December 27, 2020, which includes approximately 1,700 in our newsroom.
Approximately 40% of our full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions as of December 27, 2020, including certain employees at Wirecutter who formed a union in 2019. The following is a list of collective bargaining agreements covering various categories of the Company’s employees and their corresponding expiration dates. As indicated below, five collective bargaining agreements, under which approximately 30% of our full-time equivalent employees are covered, will expire within one year and negotiations for new contracts are either ongoing or expected to begin in the near future. We cannot predict the timing or the outcome of these negotiations.
