Item 1. | Business.


(a) General Development of Business 

General

Philip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside of the United States of America. Our products are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.

Our portfolio of international and local brands is led by Marlboro, the world’s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 35% of our total 2016 shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament and Virginia S. Our leading mid-price brands are L&M, Lark, Merit, Muratti and Philip Morris. Other leading international brands include Bond Street, Chesterfield, Next and Red & White.

We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as Dji Sam Soe, Sampoerna and U Mild in Indonesia; Champion, Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines; Apollo-Soyuz and Optima in Russia; Morven Gold in Pakistan; Boston in Colombia; Belmont, Canadian Classics and Number 7 in Canada; f6 in Germany; Delicados in Mexico; Assos in Greece, and Petra in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. While there are a number of markets where local brands remain important, international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets. With international brands contributing approximately 77% of our shipment volume in 2016, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from this trend. 

In addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of Reduced-Risk Products ("RRPs"). RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.  We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.  Because our RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than found in cigarette smoke. Further details on our RRPs are described in the Research and Development section below and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 7"), Business Environment — Reduced-Risk Products.
Separation from Altria Group, Inc.

We were a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. ("Altria") until the distribution of all of our shares owned by Altria (the “Spin-off”) was made on March 28, 2008 (the "Distribution Date").
Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements 

Details about our acquisitions and other business arrangements are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 8") in Note 6. Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements.
Source of Funds — Dividends

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock. 
(b) Financial Information About Segments 

We divide our markets into four geographic regions, which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes:

 1


• | The European Union (“EU”) Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the EU countries and also comprises Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the EU through trade agreements; 


• | The Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EEMA”) Region is also headquartered in Lausanne and includes Eastern Europe, certain Balkan countries, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa and our international duty free business;


• | The Asia Region is headquartered in Hong Kong and covers all other Asian markets as well as Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands; and


• | The Latin America & Canada Region is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.

Net revenues and operating companies income* (together with a reconciliation to operating income) attributable to each segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 12. Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. See Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our operating results by business segment.

The relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:


 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
European Union | 35.8 | % | | 32.6 | % | 31.6 | %
Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa | 27.1 | | | 31.2 | | 33.5 | 
Asia | 28.7 | | | 26.3 | | 26.4 | 
Latin America & Canada | 8.4 | | | 9.9 | | 8.5 | 
 | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

______________________________

* | Our management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income, which we define as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, plus equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 

We use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). We often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments, and, in those circumstances, we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products. Our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.
Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.

(c) Narrative Description of Business 

Our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture, market and sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States of America.

Our total cigarette shipments decreased by 4.1% in 2016 to 812.9 billion units. We estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 5.3 trillion units in 2016, a 3.0% decrease over 2015. We estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume, excluding the United States of America) was approximately 15.3% in 2016, 15.5% in 2015 and 15.4% in 2014. Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately 27.9%, 28.5%, and 28.3% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Shipments of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro, decreased by 1.4% in 2016 and represented approximately 9.6% of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, in 2016, 9.6% in 2015 and 9.4% in 2014. 

We have a cigarette market share of at least 15% and, in a number of instances, substantially more than 15%, in approximately 100 markets, including  Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, 
 2

Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. 

The term IQOS Consumables refers to the consumable used in our IQOS device. Total shipment volume of IQOS Consumables reached 7.4 billion units, up from 396 million units during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Our other tobacco products ("OTP") primarily include tobacco for roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and do not include Reduced-Risk Products. Total shipment volume of OTP, in cigarette equivalent units, decreased by 4.5% to 32.6 billion units.
References to total international cigarette market, defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States, total cigarette market, total market and market shares in this Form 10-K are our tax-paid estimates based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources. 
Consumer Focused Marketing & Sales 

In 2016, we continued to deploy our new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our in-depth knowledge of various sales territories. This framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult smokers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners. The main benefits are:

• | Improved effectiveness of direct adult smoker engagement activities;


• | More effective communication with our retailers about our brands;


• | Increased speed, efficiency and widespread availability of our products; and


• | Distribution and Sales Strategies and Trade Engagement Programs tailored to the individual characteristics of each market.

The four main types of distribution that we use globally, often simultaneously in a given market, are: 


• | Direct Sales and Distribution, where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers;


• | Distribution through Independent Distributors who also are distributing other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a single market;


• | Exclusive Zonified Distribution, where the distributors are dedicated to us in tobacco products distribution and assigned to exclusive territories within a market, enabling them to get an appropriate return on their investment; and


• | Distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade.


In many markets we also directly supply key accounts, including gas stations, retail chains and supermarkets. 

Our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 19,800 employees worldwide. Our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism.
Our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels, including, where permitted by law, point of sale communications, brand events, access-restricted websites and printed and direct communication to verified adult smokers. Our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail, e-mail and other electronic communication tools. Promotional activities include, where permitted by law, competitions, invitations to events, interactive programs, consumer premiums and price promotions. To support advertising and promotional activities in the markets, we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult smokers based on the latest technologies and adult smoker trends. In addition, we developed digital and non-digital engagement programs for retailers.
Our IQOS distribution strategy is tailored to the individual characteristic of each market. We have adopted a scalable strategy for the IQOS commercialization focused on retail experience, guided consumer trials and customer care. We are also developing several ways to connect with adult smokers through digital communication tools such as mobile apps in several markets.

Competition    

We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and retail price. Our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. We predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro, L&M, Parliament and Chesterfield, which are the most popular across many of our markets. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.
 Procurement and Raw Materials    

We purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. We also contract directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Poland. Direct sourcing from farmers represents approximately 17% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Brazil, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), China, Malawi, India, the United States, Mozambique, Argentina, Philippines and Tanzania.
We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.
In addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 450 suppliers. Our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 50% of our total direct materials purchases. The three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business.
 Business Environment 
Information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in Item 7, Business Environment.

Other Matters

Customers 

None of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
Employees 
 
At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 79,500 people worldwide, including employees under temporary contracts and hourly paid part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are excellent.

Executive Officers of the Registrant     
The disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth under the heading “Executive Officers as of February 14, 2017” in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 10").

Research and Development 

Our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation, which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore, we are developing a portfolio of products intended to 
 4

appeal to a variety of distinct tastes. Four RRP platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness. We describe each of them in more detail in Item 7, Business Environment—Reduced-Risk Products.
The research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, is set forth in Item 8, Note 14. Additional Information to the consolidated financial statements. 
Intellectual Property 
Our trademarks are valuable assets, and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including Marlboro, or have the right to use them in all countries where we use them.

In addition, we have more than 5,900 granted patents worldwide and approximately 6,400 pending patent applications. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs and proprietary secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Effective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”). The Intellectual Property Agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between PMI and PM USA. Ownership of the jointly funded intellectual property has been allocated as follows:


• | PMI owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and


• | PM USA owns all rights to the jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.

Ownership of intellectual property related to patent applications and resulting patents based solely on the jointly funded intellectual property, regardless of when filed or issued, will be exclusive to PM USA in the United States, its territories and possessions and exclusive to PMI everywhere else.

The Intellectual Property Agreement contains provisions concerning intellectual property that is independently developed by us or PM USA following the Distribution Date. For ten years following the Distribution Date, independently developed intellectual property may be subject to rights under certain circumstances that would allow either us or PM USA a priority position to obtain the rights to the new intellectual property from the other party, with the price and other commercial terms to be negotiated.
In the event of a dispute between us and PM USA under the Intellectual Property Agreement, we have agreed with PM USA to submit the dispute first to negotiation between our and PM USA’s senior executives and then to binding arbitration.
Seasonality 

Our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism.
Environmental Regulation    

We are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint and wastage as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly, the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of climate change. We have developed and implemented a consistent environmental and occupational health, safety and security management system ("EHSS"), which involves policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. We also conduct regular safety assessments at our offices, warehouses and car fleet organizations. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of our EHSS management system at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards for safety and environmental management. The environmental performance data we report externally is also verified by a qualified third party. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on the management and controls we have in place and our review of climate change risks (both physical and regulatory), environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.
