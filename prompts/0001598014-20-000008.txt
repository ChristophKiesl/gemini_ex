Our Vision
Our vision is to be our customers’ leading source for critical information, analytics, and insight. Our purpose is to help our customers grow, enabling better decision making and operational efficiency.
Our Business
We deliver data, insight, and software that combine our expertise, unique content sets, and leading technology to the world’s major industries, financial markets, and governments. Our analytics reveal interdependencies across complex industries, which enhances transparency, reduces risk, and improves operational efficiency for our customers. Our information, analytics, and solutions are significant components in the systems and workflows of many of our customers and continue to become increasingly important to our customers’ operations. We leverage leading technologies and our industry expertise to create innovative products and services that provide information and insight to our customers to help them be more efficient and make more informed decisions. We are committed to sustainable, profitable growth.
Our core competency is using our expertise to source and transform data into information and analytics that our customers can use when making operational and strategic decisions. We are a dependable resource for our customers, who require and demand the most accurate and robust information available. We are dedicated to providing the information and analysis our customers need to make critical decisions that drive growth and value for their operations.
By integrating and connecting our information and analytics with proprietary and widely used decision-support technology on scalable platforms, we produce critical information and insight designed to meet our customers’ needs. Our product development teams have also created proprietary Web services and application interfaces that enhance access to our information and allow our customers to integrate our offerings with other data, business processes, and applications (such as computer-aided design, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), supply chain management, and product data/lifecycle management).
Our Objectives
To achieve our vision, we are focusing our efforts primarily on the following areas:


• | Customers. We are working together with our customers to be a trusted and valued partner through meaningful and responsive engagement, deep and differentiated expertise, and best-in-class delivery.


• | Product. We strive to develop innovative, best-in-class products that deliver real value, are reliable, and stand out from our competitors.


• | Technology and data science. We are using technology and data science as a differentiator to maximize and optimize our content, expertise, and operations.


• | People. Our work environment is designed to encourage excitement and pride in the work we do and where our people are constantly learning and feel challenged, respected, and valued.


• | Efficiency. We expect to achieve operational excellence by consistently improving productivity and efficiency by leveraging technology and operations.


• | Financial strength. We seek to consistently deliver on our key financial commitments.

We benchmark our progress annually against these objectives using external and internal metrics. For example, to 
 5

measure customer and employee satisfaction, we use surveys and develop goals based on those metrics.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to bring together information, research, analytics, and technology to deliver integrated offerings to customers in separate but interconnected industries. We believe that we can best implement our strategy by using our strong foundation of leading assets, talent, and competitive positioning in large growing global markets to achieve the following:

• | Increase in geographic, product, and customer penetration. We believe there are continued opportunities to add new customers and to increase the use of our products and services by existing customers. We plan to add new customers and build our relationships with existing customers by leveraging our existing sales channels, broad product portfolio, global footprint, and industry expertise to anticipate and respond to the changing demands of our end markets.


• | Introduce innovative offerings and enhancements. To maintain and enhance our position as a leading information services provider, we introduce enhancements to our products and services, as well as launch new products and services. We maintain an active dialogue with our customers and partners to allow us to understand their needs and anticipate market developments. We also seek to develop innovative uses for our existing products and services to generate incremental revenue, find more cost-effective inputs to support our existing products and services, and facilitate development of profitable new products and services. Our investment priorities are primarily in energy, automotive, and financial services, and we intend to continue to invest across our business to increase our customer value proposition.


• | Balance capital allocation. We expect to balance capital allocation between returning capital to shareholders (targeting an annual capital return of 50 to 75 percent of our annual capital capacity through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends) and completing mergers and acquisitions, focused primarily on targeted transactions in our core end markets that will allow us to continue to build out our strategic position. We intend to operate at the high end of our capital policy target leverage ratio of 2.0-3.0x.

Our Global Organizational Structure
To serve our customers, we are organized into the following four industry-focused segments:
•Financial Services, which includes our financial Information, Solutions, and Processing product offerings;
•Transportation, which includes our Automotive and Maritime & Trade product offerings;
•Resources, which includes our Upstream and Downstream product offerings; and

• | Consolidated Markets & Solutions, which includes our Product Design, Economics & Country Risk, and TMT benchmarking product offerings.

We believe that this sales and operating model helps our customers do business with us by providing a cohesive, consistent, and effective product, sales, and marketing approach by segment.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

• | Trusted partner with diversified, global customer base and strong brand recognition. We believe that our customers trust and rely on us for our consultative approach to product development, dedication to customer satisfaction, and ability to execute and deliver effective product and service offerings. Our industry expertise allows us to effectively anticipate, understand, and address our customers’ needs. Our global footprint allows us to serve our customers throughout the world and to introduce our products and services to customers in new markets. Our product offerings are well established and recognized in multiple industries. We also own a number of well-known brands, including CARFAX, CERAWeek, the Purchasing Managers Index series, and the iBoxx indices.


• | Breadth and depth of information and analytics. Our customers benefit from a concentration of intellectual wealth and thought leadership in a variety of industries. We believe that our global team of information and industry experts, research analysts, and economists provides our customers with leading strategic information and research. We convert raw data into critical information through a series of transformational steps that reduce the uncertainty that is inherent in unrefined data. Our goal is to ensure that the information we provide through our product offerings is correct, current, complete, and consistent; therefore, we place a high degree of emphasis on the data transformation process. 

 6

With our process, we believe that we can provide information and analytics that are both useful to our customers and available where and when needed. Our process also provides the foundation for the integration of our products and services into differentiated offerings and advanced analytics for the customers in our target industries.

• | Attractive financial model. We believe we have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue, margin expansion, cash generation, and capital flexibility characteristics.


◦ | Significant recurring revenue. We offer our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee agreements, and this business model has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. For the year ended November 30, 2019, we generated approximately 85 percent of our revenue from recurring revenue streams. Many of our offerings are core to our customers’ business operations, and we have long-term relationships with many of our customers.


◦ | Solid margin expansion. Our customer focus and fiscal discipline have permitted us to maintain and progressively increase our margins as we integrate and streamline our operations and leverage our business model to provide valuable customer support.


◦ | High cash generation. Our business has low capital requirements for product enhancement and new product development, allowing us to generate strong cash flow.


◦ | Capital flexibility. Our cash flow model and credit quality provide us with a significant amount of flexibility in decision-making, allowing us to balance internal resource and investment needs, acquisitions, and shareholder return.

Our Customers
We have a diverse customer base, with more than 50,000 business and government customers, including 80 percent of the Fortune Global 500 and more than 80 percent of the Fortune U.S. 1000. Our customers operate in global interconnected industries and financial markets, and we continue to build on our existing scale to integrate our comprehensive content, expertise, tools, technology, and research and analysis to produce a differentiated offering that makes us an important part of many of our customers’ core workflows. In 2019, no customer or group of affiliated customers represented more than 10 percent of our revenue.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are located throughout the world and are organized within their respective business lines to align with our 
 10

customers. In addition to field experience, we also conduct regular customer surveys to understand both current customer satisfaction levels and potential opportunities for product and coverage improvement.
Our financial services and corporate account management teams are part of our overall sales organization and are responsible for the delivery of the full breadth of our products and services to new and existing customers. The account management teams are also responsible for our overall relationship with our larger customers, focusing on developing new business, increasing our sales pipeline, and developing strategic transactions.
Our marketing organization is aligned with our sales organization and defines our marketing strategy and executes marketing programs. A primary focus for marketing strategy is to build IHS Markit brand awareness, revenue acceleration, and market leadership across our key industries for all products and services globally. Functionally, this includes corporate marketing, product marketing, and field marketing.
Competition
We believe the principal competitive factors in our business include the following:

• | Depth, breadth, timeliness, and accuracy of information and data provided

•Quality of decision-support tools and services
•Quality and relevance of our analysis and insight
•Ease of use
•Customer support
•Value for price

We believe that we compete favorably on each of these factors. Although we face competition in specific industries and with respect to specific offerings, we do not believe that we have a direct competitor across all of the industries we serve due to the depth and breadth of our offerings. Competitors within specific industries or with respect to specific offerings are described below.

• | Financial Services. Our Information offerings primarily compete with offerings from Bloomberg, FactSet, IntercontinentalExchange, S&P Global, MSCI, Refinitiv, Nasdaq, and FIS. Our Processing products and services primarily compete with Bloomberg, IntercontinentalExchange, Tradeweb, and Refinitiv. Our Solutions offerings primarily compete with firms such as BlackRock, Bloomberg, Refinitiv, SS&C, State Street, Charles River, Dealogic, Allvue, and AcadiaSoft.


• | Transportation. In the Automotive market, we primarily compete with offerings from Experian, LMC Automotive, Urban Science, and Auto Alert. In Maritime & Trade markets, we primarily compete with offerings from Informa, Verisk, and S&P Global, as well as niche providers such as Trade Data Monitor, Datamyne, and Kpler.


• | Resources. Our Upstream and Downstream offerings compete primarily with offerings from Verisk, Enverus, Schlumberger, Halliburton, GeoScout, Reed Elsevier, Bloomberg NEF, Argus, RS Energy, DTN, S&P Global, and Nexant.


• | CMS. Our Product Design offerings primarily compete with offerings from SAI Global, Clarivate Analytics, and the standards developing organizations (“SDOs”), among others. Our ECR offerings compete primarily with offerings from the Economist Group, Oxford Economics, BMI Research, Fitch Solutions, Moody’s Analytics, McGraw-Hill Education, Control Risks, and Verisk.

Government Contracts
We sell our products to various government agencies and entities. No individual contract is significant to our business. Although some of our government contracts are subject to terms that would allow renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the government, we believe that no renegotiation or termination of any individual contract or subcontract at the election of the government would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Intellectual Property
We rely heavily on intellectual property, including the intellectual property we own and license. We regard our trademarks, copyrights, licenses, and other intellectual property as valuable assets and use intellectual property laws, as well as 
 11

license and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, channel and strategic partners, and others, to protect our rights. In addition, we exercise reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights and enforce these rights when we become aware of any potential or actual violation or misuse.
We use intellectual property licensed from third parties, including SDOs, government agencies, public sources, market data providers, financial institutions, and manufacturers, as a component of our offerings and, in many cases, it cannot be independently replaced or recreated by us or others. We have longstanding relationships with most of the third parties from whom we license information. Almost all of the licenses that we rely upon are nonexclusive and expire within one to two years, unless renewed, although we have longer licenses with some of those third parties, particularly in the Financial Services segment.
We maintain registered trademarks and service marks in jurisdictions around the world. In addition, we have obtained patents and applied for patents in the United States. For more information relating to our intellectual property rights, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information.”
Employees
As of November 30, 2019, we had more than 15,500 employees located in 38 countries around the world.
Seasonality
Our business has seasonal aspects. Our first quarter generally has our lowest quarterly levels of revenue and profit. We also experience event-driven seasonality in our business; for instance, we typically hold our annual CERAWeek, World Petrochemical, and TPM conferences in the second quarter of each year. Another example is the biennial release of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (“BPVC”) engineering standard, which generates revenue for us predominantly in the third quarter of every other year. The most recent BPVC release was in the third quarter of 2019.
