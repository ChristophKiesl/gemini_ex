Item 1. Business. 
Our History and Business
 
Our business is to use sustainable technology to produce sustainable products. TransAct Energy Corp has transitioned from its original focus of developing raw energy resources to manufacturing using solid waste as an above ground resource/asset. 
 
We formed TransAct Energy Corp. as a Nevada corporation on March 15, 2006. Although our business plan called for the securing and managing of any energy leasehold, the Company focused on securing producing and non-producing oil and gas leases in Alberta, Canada. On September 7, 2006, we acquired a one hundred percent (100%) interest in a Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease, from the province of Alberta, Canada for twelve thousand and fifty-one dollars ($12,051), the MedHat Project. We did not develop this resource. We looked to expand our holdings in Alberta through acquisitions and joint ventures for the following two years. We have since allowed this lease to lapse and moved away from this focus.

In 2008, the Company was introduced to geothermal power projects in British Columbia, Canada. We worked with companies Aqua Terra Power and Aqua Terra Geothermal through the balance of 2009 on the two geothermal power projects in British Columbia. Other than lending Aqua Terra funds; no formal arrangement was entered pending them securing drill permits on the two projects. The licenses associated with these projects lapsed and were acquired by a different corporation. We entered discussions with this entity in the latter half of 2011 to form a Farm-in relationship. We have put these discussions on hold pending the completion of our first waste optimization plant although we are maintaining dialogue with its principals as it relates to utilizing Geothermal in the plants themselves.
 
TransAct in mid-2009 started introducing the concept of geothermal power to markets in Western and South Asia with the plan to enter joint venture relationships to develop geothermal power projects in these areas. To enter these markets as a power producer, the Company found it strategic to add the development of traditional carbon fueled power projects. After discussions with Spectrum Energy Project Investments (a UAE power company), we submitted applications to the Basra Investment Commission to develop/manage three natural gas power plants. These multi-billion-dollar projects came with long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) and sovereign guarantees and our application through Spectrum was shortlisted. We were unsuccessful in completing our acquisition of 50% of Spectrum and the initial offering lapsed. 
 
On August 31, 2009, TransAct Energy completed and closed its initial public offering at twenty-five cents ($0.25) per share selling one million one hundred and two thousand shares (1,102,000) for a total capital raise of two-hundred and seventy-four thousand three hundred and ninety-eight dollars ($274,398 USD). Most of these funds were placed with Aqua Terra Power as convertible notes to secure and develop the four (4) geothermal licenses in British Columbia, Canada; the balance was used to pay the costs of the offering and a small amount went to working capital. The Company was approved for listing on the OTCBB in December 2009 and received the trading symbol “TEGY.” 
 
Throughout 2010 we laid the groundwork for large power projects in South Europe, Asia and Africa; smaller projects for solar, waste to energy and hydrogen fuel cells specifically in India. We worked to secure markets for geothermal, new solar photo-voltaic, waste to energy and hydrogen fuel cell generators. 
 
Joint development agreement negotiations took place in December 2010 clearing the way for Transact to enter one major project in South East Asia in 2011. The 2011 year was frustrated with the company’s inability to collect raised or earned funds into the company’s bank account. Thus projects, joint ventures and previous efforts were postponed or lost permanently. While we did maintain the company’s trading status, the year was taken up with collection efforts and supporting business relationships while in limbo. We did initiate discussions on new waste to energy technologies to leverage the work we had done previously in this sector.
 
The Company’s 2012 efforts were focused on building out a Waste Optimization division. We completed a Business Plan for this division and entered a Joint Development Agreement with the owners of a small scale, proprietary, zero emissions waste optimization plant (“ZEWOPtm”) that had been operating a 20 tonne per day plant for two years. We reconnected with clients in India and Brazil for future waste optimization opportunities. From the second quarter, through to the end of 2012 we worked to raise the necessary funds to build a municipal scale plant (1000+ tonnes per day) in Scotland. 
 
2013 continued as a building year for both the company and its Waste Optimization division. We completed the acquisition of the ZEWOPtm technology from the Scottish Inventor and brought him on as a long-term member of our team. We successfully negotiated a relationship with the international firm Fichtner Consulting Engineers to complete the certification of our plants going forward. We identified suppliers of feedstock for the proposed United Kingdom plants, initiated the relationships for the uptake of any Synthetic Gas and Electricity(neither are part of our product mix now) in the United Kingdom and tentatively sourced the capital required for the first plant in the United Kingdom. Globally we negotiated the intent to build a plant in Mexico that includes the required equity and feedstock. In Brazil, we initiated a relationship to create a green energy fund to grow both the market in Brazil and the other strategic areas of South America. Initial talks have taken place with potential development partners for a few of the major Brazil markets pending the success of the Mexico plant. 
 
Throughout 2014 TransAct worked to finalize the engineering review and agreements necessary to develop the first ZEWOPtm in Puebla, Mexico. The plant under design is capable of processing 1320 metric tons per day of Municipal Solid Waste (“MSW”) and is estimated to cost approximately three hundred million dollars. In late November Fichtner Consulting Engineers reported they believed the ZEWOPtm could process the MSW 100% into useable products without emissions. The Fichtner report provided TransAct the opportunity to submit the Waste Supply Agreement to the Municipality of Puebla, prepare off-take agreements for interested buyers of the ZEWOPtm products and formalize the share purchase agreement with the Puebla Waste Consortium (“PWC”). PWC intended on providing 30% of the capital required to build the ZEWOPtm, while TransAct negotiates third party lenders for the remaining 70% of the cost through debt instruments.

The Company delivered the results of the Fichtner Report to the Puebla City Staff in December of 2014. The cost of the plant was more than originally discussed because it included MSW pre-processing and dewatering component. This affected the required equity and although it was never stated, appears to be cause of the PWC hesitation. We also found out subsequently that there was legal wrangling and back room negotiations between the existing MSW concession holders and the municipal/state government, affecting their ability to sign with us. After 6 months with no movement forward for the MSW feedstock from the City of Puebla, Management set out in 2015 to secure an alternate source of MSW. The agreement we had with the Puebla Waste Consortium was terminated, however, the sales efforts were all to National/International companies whose interest in our products will not change with a change in location. 
 
Because of the specialized nature of many of the ZEWOPtm components, we initiated some of the equipment procurement; thus, we entered a design/supply agreement for our proprietary reactors with a specialized engineering firm. 
 
2014 saw the Company form subsidiary corporations in Ireland and Mexico. In Ireland we established the wholly owned subsidiary “TransAct Energy Global Limited”, this company will in turn wholly own each national subsidiary. The first national subsidiary of TransAct Global is “TransAct Energy Mexico S.DE R.L. DE C.V.” which will own a majority shareholding of each holding company that owns a ZEWOPtm like the Mexican corporation “Puebla ZEWOP 1, S. DE R.L. DE C.V.”. 
 
At the beginning of 2015 we focused on finalizing the sale of the anticipated ZEWOPtm products. These efforts included getting signed letters of intent from qualified buyers and preparing formal legal agreements for the same. We now have letters of intent from multiple qualified buyers for all the expected product and agreements ready to be signed subject to us finalizing our feed-stock agreement (Waste Supply Agreement) for the first plant. 
 
In summary 2015’s efforts focused on completing the due-diligence for the Mexican candidate feedstocks including matching equity partners and buyers of the resulting products. To that end, we now have several feedstock agreements to negotiate through to a final agreement or dismiss depending on the outcome of the negotiations. The potential equity partners have been identified subject to finalizing the feedstock agreement and pre-sales of the future products. The clients that signed letters of intent for the products have also been briefed on the potential feedstock cities to confirm their commitment. Every effort was made during the year to keep the candidate banks for debt financing informed of our progress and they appear to be continuing with their support. 
 
2016 we focused on finalizing contracts for the required MSW feedstock. The results were a signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a private contractor in Mexico City and a municipality outside of Asuncion, Paraguay; a letter of invitation from the Republic of Panama; and a formal proposal to a municipality in the State of Jalisco, Mexico now awaiting the formal request for proposal coming in 2017. The Mexico City MOU was followed in December 2016 with a Waste Supply Agreement. Each opportunity was negotiated to satisfy our need for thirteen-hundred and twenty metric tons per day of MSW feedstock per ZEWOPtm. 
 
2017 was Transacts breakthrough year as it finally secured the required feedstock under long-term contract for its first ZEWOPtm to be in Mexico’s second largest city Guadalajara. We immediately secured a strategically located industrial site in El Salto and have proceeded to pre-sell the products from the future ZEWOPtm.
 
In 2018 we focused on completing the due diligence for the El Salto site, the pre-development capital required to pay for the building-site and the completion of all preliminary design work required to secure an EPC Contractor (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) through the tender process to build the ZEWOPtm. Due diligence was completed proving the site suitable for our proposed use and the landowners have so far continued to wait for us to close on the site. 
 
The pre-development capital was committed to as a bridge-loan, but to date has not been received.

2019 was dominated with closing the funds to build the El Salto ZEWOPtm and preparing the Company for operating status. This included continued meetings with members of the new Mexican government to forward our waste management approach in Mexico and renegotiating the purchase of the El Salto lands anticipating a closing. We started the process of acquiring a sustainable geothermal technology that will provide most of the energy required to operate the ZEWOPtm. Our incoming COO and CPO started working through the people requirements for Mexico. 
 
We acquired another Irish corporation to hold our physical assets in Ireland as we start the search for facilities to house our global accounting, human resources, and research/development offices in Dublin. To that end Christina Kenny officially came on as our Chief People Officer starting the process of identifying our first hires for both the global administration and the El Salto ZEWOPtm. 
 
2020 had two focuses: We continued raising the predevelopment capital for El Salto, Mexico and new business development initiatives that could result in cash flow. Raising the pre-development capital for El Salto during COVID-19 Pandemic led to the loss of several funders, however, as companies adjusted it created new opportunities. We reduced our initial capital requirements by $10 Million through negotiating a lease/purchase agreement on the El Salto lands. Then after many single-family office contacts we negotiated the balance of the funds required. We have secured a $14 Million loan with an office that owns an EPC Contractor and we have agreed to their preferred vendor status, provided they are competitive through the tender process. In terms of business development, we contracted to develop a retail business using our core reactor technology. The retail opportunity is now in the business planning stage.
 
Business Strategy
 
TransAct Energy Corp. has elected to focus entirely on the global development and dissemination of its 
ZEWOPtm. The ZEWOPtm makes ecological, economic, cultural, and social sense. Becoming an engine that supports the circular economy in any community it enters, sustainably; Municipalities can now be paid instead of paying to manage their MSW. In the process, TransAct is able to incorporate many of the energy technologies it has worked on including, geothermal and solar. 
 
It is our intent during the eighteen-months that it should take to construct the first municipal scale ZEWOPtm; to debug any mechanical/operational issues of the design. After the first building is complete (approximately one-year in), we will secure the second site in Guadalajara and start its construction as soon as the first plant is certified operational. We will complete the assembly of the second ZEWOPtm to perfect the project management process, creating a cookie cutter approach to ZEWOPtm erection. 
 
The first two ZEWOPtm gives us the opportunity to recruit and train the project managers’ expertise to effectively work with our EPC contractors in the development of each new ZEWOPtm; with a focusing on streamlining the supply chain of required materials and equipment. 
 
During the estimated twenty-four to 30 months it will take to get the first two ZEWOPtm underway, we intend on imbedding a team in Europe to secure feedstock and development sites for the next twenty ZEWOPtm. This approach will be continued around the globe, selecting major markets that are politically and economically ready to adopt our approach to sustainable manufacturing using solid waste. Upon receipt (in the first quarter of 2021) of the loan funds required for the predevelopment of the El Salto, 
ZEWOPtm; our pre-described timeline will start. 
 
With a firm start date and location of the first ZEWOPtm TransAct Energy Mexico can proceed to finalize long-term offtake agreements. We will reengage Fichtner Consulting Engineers to prepare working drawings, that while being approved under permits and permissions will go to tender for a guaranteed procurement and construction contract (EPC). We have selected a preferred vendor for this role, however, they still have to compete in the EPC tender process. When these steps are completed, we intend on finalizing the tentative financing commitments we have in place with two international investment banks. 
 
TransAct intends on establishing the manufacturing of our proprietary reactors in Mexico in 2021. We have already initiated discussions for a joint venture agreement with an ISO 9001 and ASME capable manufacturer. Our facility would supply the demand for both Mexico, South America, Central America, Canada and the USA. 
 
ZEWOPtm can demonstrate to Mexico and the World a municipal scale solution to manufacturing using solid waste without emissions. Although we have been approached to build in other North American cities, we feel the market is best approached when the first ZEWOPtm is fully operational to garner government agency support. Once we break ground, we will make sure major municipalities throughout the US and Canada are aware of our process, so we get on their technology review lists. This will ensure a smoother entry into North American markets,
 
Until the first revenues from operations come in, our corporate operations will continue to be funded by raising money through private placements or public offerings. We anticipate bringing on an expanded management team to oversee our operational growth throughout the upcoming year and plan to raise additional capital as required.

Markets and Customers
 
The markets that need to adopt a circular economy strategy, the complete processing of solid waste into useable products/commodities without emissions or landfilling are global. Countries around the world are adopting standards that will reduce green house gas emissions. They are promoting better use of resources, ultimately seeking freedom from new resource harvesting including foreign petroleum. The TransAct ZEWOPtm provides these markets with an emissions free solution utilizing their solid waste and turning it into products and fuels that can be used in these domestic markets. 
 
We have had discussions and early contract negotiations with entities in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and USA. Europe is the most advanced market with legislation in place that targets zero-landfills and zero-emissions within a few short years. The current ZEWOPtm design for mass production has a plant size processing capacity of approximately 1320 tonnes per day of raw municipal solid waste (based on 2 Kgs per day per person, approximately 660,000 people in North America slightly less in Europe). 
 
Our target service customers are corporations or municipalities with municipal solid waste, plastic, tires or medical waste as these are the most profitable waste streams. However, we can process any carbon based waste stream including sewage and agricultural. 
 
Our target ZEWOPtm product customers include airlines, shipping companies, bus companies, trucking companies or fuel retailers requiring direct blend green fuels to meet legislated targets. The EU 20/20 legislation started on January 1st of 2015, requires a 20% green fuel blend by 2020. This has created customers needing a green fuel that can blend with existing refined fuels. 
 
Since 2015, all airplanes or ships landing in the EU require 15% of their fuel to be green. We anticipate these sectors will adopt our fuels in this capacity upon EU certification. Our customers also include friction product manufacturers (brake pads, clutch plates, sanding disks) and wood product manufacturers (plywood, particle board, OSB etc.) that utilize phenol resins in their manufacturing process. We are targeting manufacturers of biodegradable plastics and pharmaceuticals for our Levoglucosan and tire and rubber manufacturers, lithographers and printers for our high quality carbon black. Waxes for the cosmetic industry, paraffin waxes for a variety of other uses including candles, along with high grade lubricating oils are ZEWOPtm products. We produce fertilizers for the agricultural industry, a brick mix for the construction industry, a variety of reclaimed metals, and purified (distilled) water. Acetic acid and furfural are manufactured for industrial chemical manufacturers. We have a diverse mix of products and potential customers. 
 
Employees
 
As at December 31, 2020, the Company has a combined CEO/CFO and the Chief People Officer. The Company has identified persons for many of its required portfolios and intends to finalize employee agreements in March 2021. The focus will be on growing the human resource, development, accounting, and sales teams first and then filling out the rest as we progress towards operations.
 
Our global offices covering human resources, accounting, research, and development will be based in Dublin, Ireland and will be staffed accordingly starting in the first quarter of 2021.
 
As the company ramps up the ZEWOPtm in Mexico, it anticipates bringing on 50 to 75 employees in its Mexican subsidiary. 
 
The Company did not experience any labour disputes or labour stoppages during the current fiscal year.
 
Principal Products
 
The Company’s principal products are carbon black, phenol resins and Levoglucosan making up approximately 71% of our proposed revenue. Waxes account for another 15%. 
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The raw material for the ZEWOPtm is solid waste; better known as trash or garbage. Humanity currently produces over 11 Billion tonnes of waste per year. Just over 2 Billion tonnes is processed by use of landfills or incineration technologies; while the rest is dumped raw onto land/oceans. Garbage is readily available in every municipality on our planet. 
Seasonality of Business
 
Waste from human activities is generated 365 days a year with slight seasonal variations occurring in MSW. Our facilities are designed to run every day of the year. The products we produce are in demand globally and used year round.

Industry Practices/Needs for Working Capital
 
The Company is heavily involved in development operations; therefore high levels of working capital will be committed directly or indirectly to the construction efforts. After a ZEWOPtm becomes commercially operational, the needs of working capital are expected to be low. The Company is expecting to be significantly involved in development activities for the next 20 years.
 
Dependence on Few Customers
 
While the waste supplied to each 
ZEWOPtm comes from millions of residences in a city; our contract is typically awarded by one customer. The Company’s dependency on one customer for the feedstock is mitigated by the long-term waste and operational guarantees in our agreement. In the future, we may be able to set up direct homeowner and business waste pickup agreements. 
 
The market for our products is vast. However, the number of entities that can physically, logistically and economically purchase large quantities of the commodity in our area of operations are limited. The Company’s primary revenues are projected to originate from carbon black (21 %+) and phenol resin (38 %+) sales. Currently, the Company has interest from three multi-national corporations for these and other ZEWOPtm products. Mitigating risk factors with customers will focus on their credit-worthiness, a guaranteed long-term contract with no out, unless we do not perform. We can also build up a multitude of small order customers over time. 
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The interest in both sustainable energy, manufacturing, and the waste to value sector have continued to grow as have the amounts of garbage. Every government on the planet is faced with growing amounts of solid waste and the mandate to use it as a resource rather than bury or burn it. The demand for sustainable energy continues to increase almost everywhere on the planet at the same time. Climate changes affect the demand for heating and cooling and the lack of rain in certain areas impacts on the ability to produce hydro-electricity. Political instability or the threat there of, in oil producing regions sends countries that have petroleum based economies scrambling for alternatives. Economic instability impacts on many countries abilities to import energy; causing them to look within their own borders for energy that provides autonomy. The pressure is on all nations to look at and change the environmental impact of their solid waste. 
 
Each product we produce is made by reprocessing solid waste, resulting in“green” and cheaper products. Our production process has no emissions or environmental impact compared to competitive products that come from crude oil and natural gas. Because our raw material is garbage, we are not subjected to market fluctuations and can consistently maintain our cost of goods compared to our competitors. The finished products are produced at much lower costs than our competitors giving us a natural advantage going forward. 
 
Any technology that can produce clean energy from waste in a cost effective manner has a competitive advantage in the complex matrix of sustainable energy production. To date, there have been no emission free and cost effective energy from waste technologies to handle the ever growing waste on our planet. Governments have settled for incineration with scrubbers that remove the pollutants to established levels. The new emission targets being established for waste going forward, limits the competition.
 
Availability of resources, upfront capital and customers willing to pay for the resulting products, determine the generation resource. The markets where they have resources but not the expertise or upfront capital, opens the competitive field for those able to build, own, and operate profitable facilities over the long-term. 
 
The Company believes that our emission free technology, low operating costs and ability to process all waste streams into useable products with full carbon capture and a low "full life" cost will allow it to successfully compete for long-term waste processing and green product supply agreements globally.
 
Factors that can influence the overall market for our products include some of the following:
 
·
number of market participants buying and selling green products including fuels; 
 
·
environmental regulations that impact us and our competitors; 
 
·
availability of production tax credits and other benefits allowed by tax law; 
 
·
relative ease or difficulty of developing and constructing new facilities; and 
 
·
credit worthiness and risk associated with buyers.
