Item 1.     Business
Overview
We are an alternative asset management firm offering yield solutions to retail and institutional investors. We focus on credit-related investment strategies, primarily originating senior secured loans to private middle market companies in the United States that have revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. We generally hold these loans to maturity. Our national direct origination franchise provides capital to the middle market in the U.S. For over 18 years, we have provided capital to over 400 companies across 35 industries in North America.
We manage three permanent capital vehicles, two of which are Business Development Companies "BDCs", and a credit interval fund, as well as long-dated private funds and Separately Managed Accounts ("SMAs"), with a primary focus on senior secured credit. As of December 31, 2019, we had $4.1 billion of AUM in two business development companies, MCC and SIC, as well as private investment vehicles. Our compounded annual AUM growth rate from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2019 was 17%, and our compounded annual Fee Earning AUM growth rate was 10%, which have both been driven in large part by the growth in our permanent capital vehicles. Typically the investment periods of our institutional commitments range from 18 to 24 months and we expect our Fee Earning AUM to increase as capital commitments included in AUM are invested.
In general, our institutional investors do not have the right to withdraw capital commitments and to date we have not experienced any withdrawals of capital commitments. For a description of the risk factor associated with capital commitments, see “Risk Factors — Third-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.”
The diagram below presents the historical correlation between growth in our AUM, fee earning AUM and management fees.
(1) Presented on a standalone basis
Direct origination, credit structuring and active monitoring of the loan portfolios we manage are important success factors in our business, which can be adversely affected by difficult market and political conditions, such as the turmoil in the global capital markets from 2007 to 2009 and the ongoing after-effects including market turbulence and volatility. Since our inception in 2006, we have adhered to a disciplined investment process that employs these principles with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns while protecting investor capital. Our focus on protecting investor capital is reflected in our investment strategy; at December 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the combined portfolios investments were in first lien positions. We believe that our ability to directly originate, structure and lead deals enables us to consistently lend at higher yields with better terms. In addition, the loans we manage generally have a contractual maturity between three and seven years and are typically floating rate 
1

(at December 31, 2019, approximately 83% of the loans we manage, based on aggregate principal amount, bore interest at floating rates), which we believe positions our business well for rising interest rates. 
Our senior management team has on average over 20 years of experience in credit, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. As of December 31, 2019, we had 65 employees, including 29 investment, origination and credit management professionals, and 36 operations, accounting, legal, compliance and marketing professionals, each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines.
Our Funds
We provide our credit-focused investment strategies through various funds and products that meet the needs of a wide range of retail and institutional investors.
Except as otherwise described herein with respect to our BDCs, our investment funds themselves do not register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), in reliance on Section 3(c)(1), Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act exempts from the Investment Company Act’s registration requirements investment funds privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are “qualified purchasers” as defined under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act exempts from the Investment Company Act’s registration requirements privately placed investment funds whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons. In addition, under certain current interpretations of the SEC, Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. investment fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers and purchase their interests in a private placement. Certain subsidiaries of Medley LLC typically serve as an investment adviser for our funds and are registered under the Advisors Act. Our funds’ investment advisers or one of their affiliates are entitled to management fees, performance fees and/or incentive fees from each investment fund to which they serve as investment advisers. For a discussion of the fees to which our funds’ investment advisers are entitled across our various types of funds, please see “Business — Fee Structure.”
Medley Capital Corporation
We launched MCC (NYSE:MCC) (TASE:MCC), our first permanent capital vehicle, in 2011 as a BDC. MCC has grown to become a BDC with approximately $0.4 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2019. MCC has demonstrated an 8% compounded annual growth rate of AUM from inception through December 31, 2019.
Sierra Income Corporation
We launched SIC, our first public non-traded permanent capital vehicle, in 2012 as a BDC. As of December 31, 2019, AUM has grown to $1.1 billion, and has demonstrated an 86% compounded annual growth rate of AUM from inception through December 31, 2019.
Sierra Total Return Fund
We launched STRF (NASDAQ:SRNTX), our first interval fund, in January 2017. STRF is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end investment management company that is operated as an interval fund. The fund commenced investment operations in June 2017.
Long-Dated Private Funds
We launched MOF I, our first long-dated private fund, in 2006, MOF II, our second long-dated private fund, in 2010, MOF III, our third long-dated private fund, in 2014, MCOF and Aspect, our fourth and fifth long-dated private funds, respectively, in 2016, and MOF III Offshore, our sixth long-dated private fund, in 2017. In 2018, we launched Aspect B. Our long-dated private funds are managed through partnership structures, in which limited partnerships organized by us accept commitments or funds for investment from institutional investors and high net worth individuals, and a general partner makes all policy and investment decisions, including selection of investment advisers. Affiliates of Medley LLC serve as the general partners and investment advisers to our long-dated private funds. The limited partners of our long-dated private funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of such funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind such funds and have no influence on the voting or disposition of the securities or assets held by such funds, although limited partners often have the right to remove the general partner or cause an early liquidation by super-majority vote. As our long-dated private funds are closed-ended, once an investor makes an investment, the investor is generally not able to withdraw or redeem its interest, except in very limited circumstances.

Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)
We launched our first SMA in 2010 and currently manage twelve SMAs. In the case of our SMAs, the investor, rather than us, dictates the risk tolerances and target returns of the account. We act as an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act for these accounts. The accounts offer customized solutions for liability driven investors such as insurance companies and typically offer attractive returns on risk based capital.
Fee Structure
We earn management fees at an annual rate of 0.75% to 2.00% and may earn performance fees, which may be in the form of an incentive fee or carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund or SMA. Management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of (1) average or total gross assets, including assets acquired with leverage, (2) total commitments, (3) net invested capital (4) NAV, or (5) lower of cost or market value of a fund’s portfolio investments. Management fees are calculated quarterly and are paid in cash in advance or in arrears depending on each specific fund or SMA. We earn incentive fees on our permanent capital vehicles and earn incentive fees on certain of our long-dated private funds. In addition, we may earn additional carried interest performance fees on our long-dated private funds and SMAs that are typically 15% to 20% of the total return over a 6% to 8% annualized preferred return.
Medley Capital Corporation
Pursuant to the investment management agreement between MCC and our affiliate, MCC Advisors LLC, MCC Advisors LLC receives a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee. Effective January 1, 2016, pursuant to a fee waiver executed by MCC Advisors LLC on February 8, 2016, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of MCC’s gross assets up to $1.0 billion and 1.50% on MCC's gross assets over $1.0 billion, and is payable quarterly in arrears (the “Reduced Base Management Fee”). The Reduced Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of MCC’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and will be appropriately pro-rated for any partial quarter. Prior to January 1, 2016, the MCC base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of MCC's gross assets. The base management fee was calculated based on the average value of MCC's gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.
The two components of the MCC incentive fee are described below.

• | The first component of the MCC incentive fee is the Part I incentive fee. Effective January 1, 2016, the incentive fee based on net investment income is reduced from 20.0% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over a fixed hurdle rate of 2.0% per quarter, to 17.5% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over a fixed hurdle rate of 1.5% per quarter. Moreover, the incentive fee based on net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to our aggregate net investment income, as adjusted, as described below (the “Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income”), from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2016). We refer to such period as the “Trailing Twelve Quarters.” The hurdle amount for the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income is determined on a quarterly basis, and is equal to 1.5% multiplied by MCC’s net assets at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments to MCC’s net assets, as determined as of the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, in order to account for any capital raising or other capital actions as a result of any issuances by MCC of its common stock (including issuances pursuant to MCC’s dividend reinvestment plan), any repurchase by MCC of its own common stock, and any dividends paid by MCC, each as may have occurred during the relevant quarter. Any Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income is paid to MCC Advisors LLC on a quarterly basis, and is based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (“Ordinary Income”) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount.” For the avoidance of doubt, Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the Reduced Base Management Fee but excluding any incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income or on MCC’s capital gains. 

The Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income for each quarter is determined as follows:

• | No incentive fee based on net investment income is payable to MCC Advisors LLC for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount;


• | 100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the “Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 1.8182% multiplied by MCC’s net assets at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter, as adjusted as noted above, comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income; and

3


• | 17.5% of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income.

The amount of the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income that is paid to MCC Advisors LLC for a particular quarter equals the excess of the incentive fee so calculated minus the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below).
The Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income that is paid to MCC Advisors LLC for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 17.5% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate incentive fees based on net investment income that was paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or a portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
“Cumulative Net Return” means (X) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (Y) any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, MCC pays no incentive fee based on net investment income to MCC Advisors for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Reduced Incentive Fee based on Net Investment Income that is payable to MCC Advisors for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, MCC pays a Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income to MCC Advisors equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income that is payable to MCC Advisors for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, MCC pays a Reduced Incentive Fee on Net Investment Income to MCC Advisors, calculated as described above, for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, and dilution to MCC’s net assets due to capital raising or capital actions, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized and accretion to MCC’s net assets due to capital raising or capital action, in such period. 
Dilution to MCC’s net assets due to capital raising is calculated, in the case of issuances of common stock, as the amount by which the net asset value per share was adjusted over the transaction price per share, multiplied by the number of shares issued. Accretion to MCC’s net assets due to capital raising is calculated, in the case of issuances of common stock (including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan), as the excess of the transaction price per share over the amount by which the net asset value per share was adjusted, multiplied by the number of shares issued. Accretion to MCC's net assets due to other capital action is calculated, in the case of repurchases by MCC of its own common stock, as the excess of the amount by which the net asset value per share was adjusted over the transaction price per share multiplied by the number of shares repurchased by MCC. 
The purpose of changing the fee structure was to permanently reduce aggregate fees payable to MCC Advisors by MCC. Beginning January 1, 2016, in order to ensure that MCC pays MCC Advisors aggregate fees on a cumulative basis under the new fee structure that are less than the aggregate fees otherwise due under the management agreement, at the end of each quarter, MCC Advisors calculates aggregate base management fees and incentive fees on net investment income under both the new fee structure and the fee structure under the management agreement, and if, at any time after January 1, 2016, the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis under the new fee structure would be greater than the aggregate fees on a cumulative basis under the fee structure under the management agreement, MCC Advisors is only entitled to the lesser of those two amounts. Since the hurdle rate is fixed, if and as interest rates rise, it would be more likely that we would surpass the hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on net investment income. 
Prior to January 1, 2016, the Part I incentive fee was payable quarterly in arrears and was 20.0% of MCC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter subject to a 2.0% (which was 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a “catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under the hurdle rate and catch-up provisions, in any calendar quarter, we received no incentive fee until MCC’s net investment income equaled the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then received, as a “catch-up,” 100% of MCC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeded the hurdle rate but was less than 2.5%. The effect of this provision was that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded 2.5% in any calendar quarter, MCC Advisors LLC would receive 20.0% of MCC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income meant interest income, dividend income and any other income including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, due diligence and consulting fees or other fees that MCC received from portfolio companies accrued during the calendar quarter, minus MCC’s operating expenses for the quarter including the base management fee, expenses payable to MCC Advisors LLC, and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued 
4

and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income included, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we had not yet received in cash. 

• | The second component of the MCC incentive fee, the Part II incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement as of the termination date), and equals 20.0% of MCC’s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to MCC Advisors LLC.

Entities controlled by former employees held limited liability company interests in MCC Advisors LLC that entitled them to approximately 4.86% of the net incentive fee income through October 29, 2015 and an additional 5.75% of the net incentive fee income through August 20, 2016 from MCC Advisors LLC. Since August 20, 2016 and going forward, we are entitled to all of the management fees paid to MCC Advisors LLC. We may have similar arrangements with respect to the ownership of the entities that advise our BDCs in the future.
Sierra Income Corporation
Pursuant to the investment management agreement between SIC and our affiliate, SIC Advisors LLC, SIC Advisors LLC receives a base management fee and a two-part incentive fee. The SIC base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of SIC’s gross assets at the end of each completed calendar quarter and is payable quarterly in arrears. 
The two components of the SIC incentive fee are as follows.

• | The first, the Part I incentive fee (which is also referred to as a subordinated incentive fee), payable quarterly in arrears, is 20.0% of SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter subject to a 1.75% (which is 7.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a “catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under the hurdle rate and catch-up provisions, in any calendar quarter, SIC Advisors LLC receives no incentive fee until SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 1.75%, but then receives, as a “catch-up,” 100% of SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%. The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter, SIC Advisors LLC will receive 20.0% of SIC’s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, due diligence and consulting fees or other fees that SIC receives from portfolio companies accrued during the calendar quarter, minus SIC’s operating expenses for the quarter including the base management fee, expenses payable to SIC Advisors LLC or to us, and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that SIC has not yet received in cash. Since the hurdle rate is fixed, if interest rates rise, it will be easier for us to surpass the hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income.


• | The second, the Part II incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment management agreement as of the termination date), and equals 20.0% of SIC’s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to SIC Advisors LLC.

Strategic Capital Advisory Services, LLC owned 20% of SIC Advisors LLC through July 31, 2018 and was entitled to receive distributions of up to 20% of the gross cash proceeds received by SIC Advisors LLC from the management and incentive fees paid by SIC to SIC Advisors LLC, net of certain expenses, as well as 20% of the returns of the investments held at SIC Advisors LLC. We may have similar arrangements with respect to the ownership of the entities that advise our BDCs in the future.
Sierra Total Return Fund
Pursuant to the investment management agreement between STRF and our affiliate, STRF Advisors LLC, STRF Advisors LLC is entitled to a base management fee and may earn an incentive fee. The STRF base management fee is calculated and payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.50% of STRF's average daily total assets during such period.
5

The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 15.0% of the Fund's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter, and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on the Fund's adjusted capital, equal to 1.50% per quarter, subject to a “catch-up” feature, which will allow STRF Advisors LLC to recover foregone incentive fees that were previously limited by the hurdle rate. Under the hurdle rate and catch-up provisions, in any calendar quarter, STRF Advisors LLC will not receive any incentive fee until STRF's pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 1.50%, but then will receive, as a “catch-up,” 100% of STRF's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 1.76%. The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.76% in any calendar quarter, STRF Advisors LLC will receive 15.0% of SIC's pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus STRF's operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses reimbursed to STRF Advisors LLC and any interest expenses and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the inventive fee). For this purpose, adjusted capital means the cumulative gross proceeds received by STRF from the sale of shares (including pursuant to STRF's distribution reinvestment plan), reduced by amounts paid in connection with purchases of shares pursuant to STRF's mandatory repurchases and discretionary repurchases. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid to STRF Advisors LLC if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate, and there is no delay of payment to STRF Advisors LLC if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate.    
Long-Dated Private Funds and SMAs
Pursuant to the respective underlying agreements of our long-dated private funds and SMAs, we receive an annual management fee and may earn incentive or performance fees. In general, management fees are calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% to 2.00% calculated on the value of the capital accounts or the value of the investments held by each limited partner, fund or account. We may also receive transaction and advisory fees from a funds' underlying portfolio investment. In certain circumstances, we are required to offset our management fees earned by 50% to 100% of transaction and advisory fees earned. In addition, we receive performance fees or carried interest in an amount equal to 15.0% to 20.0% of the realized cash derived from an investment, subject to a cumulative annualized preferred return to the investor of 6.0% to 8.0%, which is in turn subject to a 50% to 100% catch-up allocation to us.
For certain long-dated private funds, we may also earn a two-part incentive fee. The first, the Part I incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in an amount equal to 15.0% to 20.0% of the net investment income, subject to a hurdle rate equal to 1.5% to 2.0% per quarter, which is in turn subject to a 50% to 100% catch-up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. The second, the Part II incentive fee, is calculated and payable annually in an amount equal to 15.0% to 20.0% of cumulative realized capital gains. 
In order to align the interests of our senior professionals and the other individuals who manage our long-dated private funds with our own interests and with those of the investors in such funds, such individuals may be allocated directly a portion of the performance fees in such funds. These interests entitle the holders to share the performance fees earned from MOF II. We may make similar arrangements with respect to allocation of performance or incentive fees with respect to MOF III, MCOF, Aspect or other long-dated private funds that we may advise in the future.
As noted above, in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.”
Investor Relations
Our fundraising efforts historically have been spread across distribution channels and have not been dependent on the success of any single channel. We distribute our investment products through two primary channels: (1) permanent capital vehicles and (2) long-dated private funds and SMAs. We believe that each of these channels offers unique advantages to investors and allows us to continue to raise and deploy capital opportunistically in varying market environments.
6

Permanent Capital Vehicles
We distribute our permanent capital vehicles through three sub-channels:

• | MCC is our publicly traded vehicle. It offers retail and institutional investors liquid access to an otherwise illiquid asset class (middle market credit). In addition to equity capital, MCC also raises debt capital in the private and public markets which is an alternative source of capital in challenging operating environments.


• | SIC is our non-traded public vehicle. It offers retail and institutional investors access to an otherwise illiquid asset class (middle market credit) without exposure to public market trading volatility. It allows us to continue to raise capital continually during more challenging operating environments when publicly listed vehicles may be trading below net asset value (“NAV”), which we believe is valuable during times of market volatility. We believe this is a competitive advantage allowing us to make opportunistic investments, while peers may be more limited during times of market volatility.


• | STRF is our non-traded interval vehicle. It offers retail and institutional investors investments in the debt and equity of fixed-income and fixed-income related securities. STRF is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end investment management company that is operated as an interval fund.

Long-Dated Private Funds and SMAs
We distribute our long-dated private funds and SMAs through two sub-channels:

• | Long-dated private funds: Our long-dated private funds offer institutional investors attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe this channel is an important element of our capital raising efforts given institutional investors are more likely to remain engaged in higher yielding private credit assets during periods of market turbulence.


• | Separately managed accounts: Our SMAs provide investors with customized investment solutions. This is particularly attractive for liability driven investors such as insurance companies that invest over long time horizons.

We believe that our deep and long-standing investor relationships, founded on our strong performance, disciplined management of our investors’ capital and diverse product offering, have facilitated the growth of our existing business and will assist us with the development of additional strategies and products, thereby increasing our fee earning AUM in the future. We have dedicated in-house capital markets, investor relations and marketing specialists. We have frequent discussions with our investors and are committed to providing them with the highest quality service. We believe our service levels, as well as our emphasis on transparency, inspire loyalty and support our efforts to continue to attract investors across our investment platform.
Investment Process
Direct Origination. We focus on lending directly to companies that are underserved by the traditional banking system and generally seek to avoid broadly marketed investment opportunities. We source investment opportunities primarily through financial sponsors, as well as through direct relationships with companies, financial intermediaries such as national, regional and local bankers, accountants, lawyers and consultants. Historically, as much as half of our annual origination volume has been derived from either repeat or referred borrowers or repeat sponsors. The other half of our annual origination volume has been sourced through a variety of channels including direct relationships with companies, financial intermediaries such as national, regional and local bankers, accountants, lawyers and consultants, as well as through other financial sponsors. Medley investments are well diversified across 27 of the 35 industries. As of December 31, 2019, our industry exposures in excess of 10% were 11.2% in business services, 10.7% in healthcare and pharmaceuticals and 10.6% in High Tech Industries. Medley has a highly selective, three step underwriting process that is governed by an investment committee. This comprehensive process narrows down the investment opportunities from generally over 1,000 a year to approximately 1% to 3% originated borrowers in a year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sourced 451 investment opportunities across 51 borrowers and approximately $200.0 million of invested capital. As of December 31, 2019, our funds had 266 investments across 169 borrowers. 
Disciplined Underwriting. We perform thorough due diligence and focus on several key criteria in our underwriting process, including strong underlying business fundamentals, a meaningful equity cushion, experienced management, conservative valuation and the ability to deleverage through cash flows. We are often the agent for the loans we originate and accordingly influence the loan documentation and negotiation of covenants, which allows us to maintain consistent underwriting standards. We invest across a broad range of industries and our disciplined underwriting process often involves engagement of industry experts and third-party consultants. This disciplined underwriting process is essential as our funds have historically invested primarily in privately held companies, for which public financial information may be unavailable. Since our inception, we have experienced annualized realized losses for 0.7% of that capital through December 31, 2019. We believe our disciplined underwriting culture is a key factor to our success and our ability to expand our product offerings.

Prior to making an investment, the investment team subjects each potential borrower to an extensive credit review process, which typically begins with an analysis of the market opportunity, business fundamentals, company operating metrics and historical and projected financial analysis. We also analyze liquidity, operating margin trends, leverage, free cash flow and fixed charge coverage ratios for potential investments. Areas of additional underwriting focus include management or sponsor (typically a private equity firm) experience, management compensation, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, pricing power, defensibility of market share and tangible asset values. Background checks may be conducted and tax compliance information may be requested on management teams and key employees. In addition, the investment team may contact customers, suppliers and competitors and/or perform on-site visits as part of a routine business due diligence process.
The investment team routinely uses third-party consultants and market studies to corroborate valuation and industry specific due diligence, as well as provide quality of earnings analysis. Experienced legal counsel is engaged to evaluate and mitigate regulatory, insurance, tax or other company-specific risks.
After the investment team completes its final due diligence, each proposed investment is presented to our investment committee and subjected to extensive discussion and follow-up analysis, if necessary. A formal memorandum for each investment opportunity typically includes the results of business due diligence, multi-scenario financial analysis, risk-management assessment, results of third-party consulting work, background checks (where applicable) and structuring proposals. Our investment committee requires a majority vote to approve any investment.
Active Credit Management. We employ active credit management. Our process includes frequent interaction with management, monthly or quarterly reviews of financial information and, typically, attendance at board of directors’ meetings as observers. Investment professionals with deep restructuring and workout experience support our credit management effort. The investment team also evaluates financial reporting packages provided by portfolio companies that detail operational and financial performance. Data is entered in Mariana Systems, an investment management software program. Mariana Systems creates a centralized, dynamic electronic repository for all of our portfolio company data and generates comprehensive, standardized reports and dashboards, which aggregate operational updates, portfolio company financial performance, asset valuations, macro trends, management call notes and account history. 
Investment Operations and Information Technology
In addition to our investment team, we have a finance, accounting and operations team that supports our public and private vehicles team by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, valuation, capital markets and treasury functions, operations/information technology, strategy and business development, legal/compliance and human resources.
Regulatory and Compliance Matters
Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. The SEC and other regulators around the world have in recent years significantly increased their regulatory activities with respect to alternative asset management firms. Our business is subject to compliance with laws and regulations of United States federal and state governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Our business has been operated for a number of years within a legal framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability.
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”). Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to advisory clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. The SEC requires investment advisers registered or required to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act that advise one or more private funds and have at least $150.0 million in private fund assets under management to periodically file reports on Form PF. We have filed, and will continue to file, quarterly reports on Form PF, which has resulted in increased administrative costs and requires a significant amount of attention and time to be spent by our personnel. In addition, our investment advisers are subject to routine periodic examinations by the staff of the SEC. Our investment advisers also have not been subject to any regulatory or disciplinary actions by the SEC.
MCC and SIC are BDCs. A BDC is a special category of investment company under the Investment Company Act that was added by Congress to facilitate the flow of capital to private companies and small public companies based in the United States 
8

that do not have efficient or cost-effective access to public capital markets or other conventional forms of corporate financing. BDCs make investments in private or thinly traded public companies in the form of long-term debt and/or equity capital, with the goal of generating current income or capital growth.
BDCs are closed-end funds that elect to be regulated as BDCs under the Investment Company Act. As such, BDCs are subject to only certain provisions of the Investment Company Act, as well as the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. BDCs are provided greater flexibility under the Investment Company Act than are other investment companies that are registered under the Investment Company Act in dealing with their portfolio companies, issuing securities, and compensating their managers. BDCs can be internally or externally managed and may qualify to elect to be taxed as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the regulations thereunder, for federal tax purposes. The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters, and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The Investment Company Act requires that a majority of a BDC’s directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that a BDC may not change the nature of its business so as to cease to be, or withdraw its election to be regulated as a BDC unless approved by a majority of its outstanding voting securities. The Investment Company Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of its outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (2) more than 50% of its voting securities.
Generally, BDCs are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with their affiliates without the prior approval of their board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the prohibition on transactions with affiliates broadly to prohibit “joint transactions” among entities that share a common investment adviser.
On November 25, 2013, we received an amended order from the SEC that expanded our ability to negotiate the terms of co-investment transactions among our BDCs and other funds managed by us (the “Exemptive Order”), subject to the conditions included therein. In situations where co-investment with other funds managed by us is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer or where the different investments could be expected to result in a conflict between our interests and those of our other clients, we will need to decide which client will proceed with the investment. We will make these determinations based on our policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on an alternating basis that will be fair and equitable over time. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, our BDCs will be unable to invest in any issuer in which another of our funds holds an existing investment. Similar restrictions limit our BDCs’ ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates.
Under the terms of the Exemptive Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the independent directors of our BDCs must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the applicable BDC and such BDC’s stockholders and do not involve overreaching of such BDC or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the BDC’s stockholders and is consistent with its investment strategies and policies.
Our BDCs have elected to be treated as RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. As RICs, the BDCs generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that is distributed to its stockholders from its tax earnings and profits. To maintain qualification as a RIC, our BDCs must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, the BDCs must distribute to their stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of their “investment company taxable income,” which is generally its net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including oversight and regulation of systemic market risk (including the power to liquidate certain institutions); authorizing the Federal Reserve to regulate nonbank institutions that are deemed systemically important; generally prohibiting insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of any of these types of entities, regardless of geographic location, from conducting proprietary trading or investing in or sponsoring a “covered fund,” which includes private equity funds and hedge funds (i.e., the Volcker Rule); and imposing new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers. Importantly, while several key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been defined through final rules, some aspects still remain to be implemented by various regulatory bodies.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory authorities to promulgate certain rules relating to the regulation of the derivatives market. Such rules require or will require the registration of certain market participants, the clearing 
9

of certain derivatives contracts through central counterparties, the execution of certain derivatives contracts on electronic platforms, as well as reporting and recordkeeping of derivatives transactions. Certain of our funds may from time to time, directly or indirectly, invest in instruments that meet the definition of a “swap” under the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC’s rules promulgated thereunder. As a result, such funds may qualify as commodity pools, and the operators of such funds may need to register as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) unless an exemption applies. Additionally, pursuant to a rule finalized by the CFTC in December 2012, certain classes of interest rate swaps and certain classes of index credit default swaps have also been subject to mandatory clearing, unless an exemption applies. Since February 2014, many of these interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps have also been subject to mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides expanded enforcement authority to the CFTC and SEC. While certain rules have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing. In particular, the CFTC has finalized most of its rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the SEC has proposed several rules regarding security-based swaps but has only finalized a small number of these rules.
Competition
The investment management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our funds and in acquiring investments in attractive investee companies and making other investments. We compete for outside investors based on a variety of factors, including:

• | investment performance;


• | investor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest;


• | quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;


• | business reputation; and


• | the level of fees and expenses charged for services.

We face competition in our lending and other investment activities primarily from other credit-focused funds, specialized funds, BDCs, real estate funds, hedge fund sponsors, other financial institutions and other parties. Many of these competitors in some of our business are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than are available to us. Many of these competitors have similar investment objectives to us, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make. Lastly, institutional and individual investors are allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies. Several large institutional investors have announced a desire to consolidate their investments in a more limited number of managers. We expect that this will cause competition in our industry to intensify and could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies.
Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.
For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — The investment management business is competitive.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 65 individuals, including 29 investment, origination and credit management professionals, located in our New York office. 
Agreements and Plans of Merger 
On August 9, 2018, MDLY entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “MDLY Merger Agreement”), dated as of August 9, 2018, by and among MDLY, Sierra and Sierra Management, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which MDLY and the Company would, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the MDLY Merger Agreement, merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the merger (the “MDLY Merger”). In the MDLY Merger, each share of MDLY Class A common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in the MDLY Merger Agreement) and shares of MDLY Class A common stock held by MDLY, the Company, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) would be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.3836 shares of Sierra’s common stock; plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $3.44 per share. In addition, MDLY stockholders would have the right to receive certain dividends and/or other payments. Simultaneously, pursuant to the Agreement 
10

and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 9, 2018, by and between Medley Capital Corporation (“MCC”) and Sierra (the “MCC Merger Agreement”), MCC would, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the MCC Merger Agreement, merge with and into Sierra, with Sierra as the surviving company in the merger (the “MCC Merger” together with the MDLY Merger, the “Mergers”). In the MCC Merger, each share of MCC’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MCC Merger effective time (other than shares of MCC’s common stock held by MCC, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) would be converted into the right to receive 0.8050 shares of Sierra’s common stock.
On July 29, 2019, MDLY entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MDLY Merger Agreement”), by and among MDLY, Sierra, and Merger Sub, pursuant to which MDLY and the Company will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the MDLY Merger. In the MDLY Merger, each share of MDLY Class A common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time (other than shares of our Class A common stock held by MDLY, the Company, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Excluded MDLY Shares”) and the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement), held, immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, by any person other than a holder of LLC Units), will be exchanged for (i) 0.2668 shares of Sierra’s common stock; plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $2.96 per share. In addition, in the MDLY Merger, each share of MDLY Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, other than the Excluded MDLY Shares and the Dissenting Shares, held, immediately prior to the MDLY Merger effective time, by holders of LLC Units will be exchanged for (i) 0.2072 shares of Sierra’s common stock; plus (ii) cash in an amount equal to $2.66 per share. Under the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, the MDLY exchange ratios and the cash consideration amount was fixed on July 29, 2019, the date of the signing of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement. The MDLY exchange ratios and the cash consideration amount are not subject to adjustment based on changes in the NAV of Sierra or the market price of MDLY Class A common stock before the MDLY Merger effective time, provided that the MDLY Merger is consummated by March 31, 2020, or, if consummated after March 31, 2020, only if the parties subsequently agree to extend the closing date on the same terms and conditions.
In addition, on July 29, 2019, MCC and Sierra announced the execution of the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2019 (the “Amended MCC Merger Agreement”), by and between MCC and Sierra, pursuant to which MCC will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, merge with and into Sierra, with Sierra as the surviving company in the MCC Merger. In the MCC Merger, each share of MCC’s common stock (other than shares of MCC’s common stock held by MCC, Sierra or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries), will be exchanged for the right to receive (i) 0.68 shares of Sierra’s common stock if the attorneys’ fees of plaintiffs’ counsel and litigation expenses paid or incurred by plaintiffs’ counsel or advanced by plaintiffs in connection with the Delaware Action, as described below (such fees and expenses, the “Plaintiff Attorney Fees”) are less than or equal to $10,000,000; (ii) 0.66 shares of Sierra’s common stock if the Plaintiff Attorney Fees are equal to or greater than $15,000,000; (iii) between 0.68 and 0.66 per share of Sierra’s common stock if the Plaintiff Attorney Fees are greater than $10,000,000 but less than $15,000,000, calculated on a descending basis, based on straight line interpolation between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000; or (iv) 0.66 shares of Sierra’s common stock in the event that the Plaintiff Attorney Fees are not fully and finally determined prior to the closing of the MCC Merger (such ratio, the “MCC Merger Exchange Ratio”). Based upon the Plaintiff Attorney Fees approved by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Court of Chancery”) as set forth in the Order and Final Judgment entered into on December 20, 2019, as described below (the “Delaware Order”), the MCC Merger Exchange Ratio will be 0.66 shares of Sierra’s common stock. MCC and Sierra are appealing the Delaware Order with respect to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s ruling on the Plaintiff Attorney Fees. Under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, the MCC Merger exchange ratio is not subject to adjustment based on changes in the NAV of Sierra or the market price of MCC’s common stock before the MCC Merger effective time. In addition, under the Settlement (as described below), the defendant parties to the Settlement (other than the Company) shall, among other things, deposit or cause to be deposited the Settlement shares, the number of shares of which is to be calculated using the pro forma NAV of $6.37 per share as of June 30, 2019, and is not subject to subsequent adjustment based on changes in the NAV of Sierra or the market price of MCC’s common stock before the MCC Merger effective time, provided that the MCC Merger is consummated by March 31, 2020, or, if consummated after March 31, 2020, only if the parties subsequently agree to extend the closing date on the same terms and conditions.
Pursuant to terms of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, the consummation of the MCC Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to closing under the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the consummation of the MDLY Merger. However, pursuant to the terms of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, the consummation of the MDLY Merger is not contingent upon the consummation of the MCC Merger. If both Mergers are successfully consummated, Sierra’s common stock would be listed on the NYSE, with such listing expected to be effective as of the closing date of the Mergers, and Sierra’s common stock will be listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, with such listing expected to be effective as of the closing date of the MCC Merger. If, however, only the MDLY Merger is consummated, Sierra’s common stock would be listed on the 
11

NYSE. If both Mergers are successfully consummated, the investment portfolios of MCC and Sierra would be combined, Merger Sub, as a successor to MDLY, would be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sierra (the "Combined Company"), and the Combined Company would be internally managed by MCC Advisors LLC, its wholly controlled adviser subsidiary. If only the MDLY Merger is consummated, while the investment portfolios of MCC and Sierra would not be combined, the investment management function relating to the operation of Sierra, as the surviving company, would still be internalized (the “Sierra/MDLY Company”) and the Sierra/MDLY Company would be managed by MCC Advisors LLC.
The Mergers are subject to approval by the stockholders of MDLY, Sierra, and MCC, regulators, including the SEC, court approval of the Settlement (as described below), other customary closing conditions and third-party consents. There is no assurance that any of the foregoing conditions will be satisfied. MDLY and Sierra have the right to terminate the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including (subject to certain limitations set forth in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement), among others: (i) by mutual written agreement of each party; (ii) any governmental entity whose consent or approval is a condition to closing set forth in Section 8.1 of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement has denied the granting of any such consent or approval and such denial has become final and nonappealable, or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement; (iii) the MDLY Merger has not closed on or prior to March 31, 2020; or (iv) either party has failed to obtain stockholder approval or the Amended MCC Merger Agreement has been terminated.
Set forth below is a description of the Decision (as defined below), which should be read in the context of the impact of the Delaware Order and corresponding Settlement.
On February 11, 2019, a purported stockholder class action related to the MCC Merger was commenced in the Delaware Court of Chancery by FrontFour Capital Group LLC and FrontFour Master Fund, Ltd. (together, "FrontFour"), captioned FrontFour Capital Group LLC, et al. v. Brook Taube et al., Case No. 2019-0100 (the “Delaware Action”) against defendants Brook Taube, Seth Taube, Jeff Tonkel, Mark Lerdal, Karin Hirtler-Garvey, John E. Mack, Arthur S. Ainsberg, MDLY, Sierra, MCC, MCC Advisors LLC, Medley Group LLC, and Medley LLC. The complaint, as amended on February 12, 2019, alleged that the individuals named as defendants breached their fiduciary duties to MCC’s stockholders in connection with the MCC Merger, and that MDLY, Sierra, MCC Advisors LLC, Medley Group LLC, and Medley LLC aided and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint sought to enjoin the vote of MCC’s stockholders on the MCC Merger and enjoin enforcement of certain provisions of the MCC Merger Agreement. 
The Delaware Court of Chancery held a trial on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and issued a Memorandum Opinion (the "Decision") on March 11, 2019. The Delaware Court of Chancery denied the plaintiffs’ requests to (i) permanently enjoin the MCC Merger and (ii) require MCC to conduct a “shopping process” for MCC on terms proposed by FrontFour in its complaint. The Delaware Court of Chancery held that MCC’s directors breached their fiduciary duties in entering into the MCC Merger, but rejected FrontFour’s claim that Sierra aided and abetted those breaches of fiduciary duties. The Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the defendants to issue corrective disclosures consistent with the Decision, and enjoined a vote of MCC’s stockholders on the MCC Merger until such disclosures had been made and stockholders had the opportunity to assimilate that information. 
On December 20, 2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered into the Delaware Order approving the settlement of the Delaware Action (the “Settlement”). Pursuant to the Settlement, MCC agreed to certain amendments to (i) the MCC Merger Agreement and (ii) the MDLY Merger Agreement, which amendments are reflected in the Amended MCC Merger Agreement and the Amended MDLY Merger agreement. The Settlement also provides for, if the MCC Merger is consummated, the creation of a settlement fund, consisting of $17 million in cash and $30 million of Sierra's common stock, with the number of shares of Sierra's common stock to be calculated using the pro forma net asset value of $6.37 per share as of June 30, 2019, which will be distributed to eligible members of the Settlement Class (as defined in the Settlement). In addition, in connection with the Settlement, on July 29, 2019, MCC entered into a Governance Agreement with FrontFour Capital Group LLC, FrontFour Master Fund, Ltd., FrontFour Capital Corp., FrontFour Opportunity Fund, David A. Lorber, Stephen E. Loukas and Zachary R. George, pursuant to which, among other matters, FrontFour is subject to customary standstill restrictions and required to vote in favor of the revised MCC Merger at a meeting of stockholders to approve the revised MCC Merger Agreement. The Settlement also provides for mutual releases between and among FrontFour and the Settlement Class, on the one hand, and the Medley Parties, on the other hand, of all claims that were or could have been asserted in the Delaware Action through September 26, 2019.
The Delaware Court of Chancery also awarded attorney’s fees as follows: (i) an award of $3,000,000 to lead plaintiffs’ counsel and $75,000 to counsel to plaintiff Stephen Altman (the “Therapeutics Fee Award”) and $420,334.97 of plaintiff counsel 
12

expenses payable to the lead plaintiff’s counsel, which were paid by MCC on December 23, 2019, and (ii) an award that is contingent upon the closing of the proposed merger transactions (the “Contingent Fee Award”), consisting of:

a. | $100,000 for the agreement by Sierra's board of directors to appoint one independent director of MCC who will be selected by the independent directors of Sierra on the board of directors of the post-merger company upon the closing of the Mergers; and


b. | the amount calculated by solving for A in the following formula:

Award[A]=(Monetary Fund[M]+Award[A]-Look Through[L])*Percentage[P]
Whereas

A | shall be the amount of the Additional Fee (excluding the $100,000 award for the agreement by Sierra's board of directors to appoint one independent director of MCC who will be selected by the independent directors of Sierra on the board of directors of the post-merger company upon the closing of the Mergers);


M | shall be the sum of (i) the $17 million cash component of the Settlement Fund and (ii) the value of the post-merger company stock component of the Settlement Fund, which shall be calculated as the product of the VPS (as defined below) and 4,709,576.14 (the number of shares of post-merger company’s stock comprising the stock component of the net settlement amount);


L | shall be the amount representing the estimated value of the decrease in shares to be received by eligible class members arising by operation of the change in the “Exchange Ratio” under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, calculated as follows:

L = ((ES * 68%) - (ES * 66%)) * VPS
Where:
ES    shall be the number of eligible shares;

VPS | shall be the pro forma net asset value per share of the post-merger company’s common stock as of the closing as reported in the public disclosure filed nearest in time and after the closing (the “Closing NAV Disclosure”); and


P | shall equal 0.26

The Contingent Fee Award is contingent upon the closing of the MCC Merger. Payment of the Contingent Fee Award will be made in two stages. First, within five (5) business days of the establishment of the Settlement Fund, MCC or its successor shall (i) pay the plaintiffs’ counsel an estimate of the Contingent Fee Award (the “Additional Fee Estimate”), less twenty (20) percent (the “Additional Fee Estimate Payment”), and (ii) deposit the remaining twenty (20) percent of the Additional Fee Estimate into escrow (the “Escrowed Fee”). For purposes of calculating such estimate, MCC or its successor shall use the formula set above, except that VPS shall equal the pro forma net asset value of the post-merger company’s common stock as reported in the public disclosure filed nearest in time and prior to the closing (the “Closing NAV Estimate”). 
Second, within five (5) business days of the Closing NAV Disclosure (as defined in the Order and Final Judgment), (i) if the Additional Fee is greater than the Additional Fee Estimate Payment, an amount of the Escrowed Fee shall be released to plaintiffs’ counsel such that the total payments made to plaintiffs’ counsel equal the Additional Fee and the remainder of the Escrowed Fee, if any, shall be released to MCC or its successor, (ii) if the Additional Fee is less than the Additional Fee Estimate Payment, plaintiffs’ counsel shall return to MCC or its successor the difference between the Additional Fee Estimate and the Additional Fee and the Escrowed Fee shall be released to MCC or its successor, or (iii) if the Additional Fee is equal to the Additional Fee Estimate Payment, the Escrowed Fee shall be released to MCC or its successor.
On January 17, 2020, MCC and Sierra filed a notice of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court from those provisions of the Order and Final Judgment with respect to the Contingent Fee Award.
Transaction expenses related to the MDLY Merger are included in the Company's general, administrative and other expenses and primarily consist of professional fees. Such expenses amounted to $4.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no transaction expenses related to the MDLY Merger during the year ended December 31, 2017.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors
You should carefully read the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Difficult market and political conditions may adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to our taxation, taxation of our investors, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on asset managers), trade barriers including tariffs, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations). These factors are outside of our control and may affect the level and volatility of asset prices and the liquidity and value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions. Ongoing developments in the U.S. and global financial markets following the unprecedented turmoil in the global capital markets and the financial services industry in late 2008 and early 2009, and ongoing after-effects including market turbulence and volatility, continue to illustrate that the current environment is still one of uncertainty and instability for investment management business. More recently, global financial markets have experienced heightened volatility, including the June 2016 “Brexit” referendum in the United Kingdom in favor of exiting the EU and subsequent uncertainty regarding the timing and terms of the exit, the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential and 2016 and 2018 congressional elections and resulting uncertainty regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies, and, more recently, concerns over increasing interest rates (particularly short-term rates), uncertainty regarding the short- and long-term effects of tax reform in the United States and uncertainty regarding trade policies and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. For example, in February 2018, global equity markets experienced a widespread sell-off, and bonds have also declined in value. Any of the foregoing (or related events or effects thereof or similar unpredictable events or uncertainties in global market or political conditions) could have a significant impact on the markets in which we operate and a material adverse impact on our business prospects and financial condition.
A number of factors have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on credit markets in particular. In addition following a sustained period of historically low interest rate levels in the United States, short-term interest rates have risen by 150 to 200 basis points since the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. Changes in and uncertainty surrounding interest rates may have a material effect on our business, particularly with respect to the cost and availability of financing for significant acquisition and disposition transactions. Furthermore, some of the provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the United States, Public Law No. 115-97 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”) could have a negative impact on the cost of financing and dampen the attractiveness of credit. There has been a corresponding meaningful increase in the uncertainty surrounding interest rates, foreign 
14

exchange rates, trade volume, and fiscal and economic policies, which has heightened volatility in the U.S. and global markets and could persist for an extended period.
These and other conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy may result in adverse consequences for our funds and their respective investee companies, which could restrict such funds’ investment activities and impede such funds’ ability to effectively achieve their investment objectives. In addition, because the fees we earn under our investment management agreements are based in part on the market value of our AUM and in part on investment performance, if any of these factors cause a decline in our AUM or result in non-performance of loans by investee companies, it would result in lower fees earned, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.
As of the date of this Form 10-K, there is an outbreak of a novel and highly contagious form of coronavirus (COVID-19), which the World Health Organization has declared to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in numerous deaths adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in certain equity and debt markets. The global impact of the outbreak is rapidly evolving, and many countries have reacted by instituting quarantines, prohibitions on travel and the closure of offices, businesses, schools, retail stores and other public venues. Businesses are also implementing similar precautionary measures. Such measures, as well as the general uncertainty surrounding the dangers and impact of COVID-19, are creating significant disruption in supply chains and economic activity and are having a particularly adverse impact on transportation, hospitality, tourism, entertainment and other industries. As COVID-19 continues to spread, the potential impacts, including a global, regional or other economic recession, are increasingly uncertain and difficult to assess.
Any public health emergency, including any outbreak of COVID-19, SARS, H1N1/09 flu, avian flu, other coronavirus, Ebola or other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, could have a significant adverse impact on the Company and could adversely affect the Company's ability to fulfill its investment objectives.
The extent of the impact of any public health emergency on the Company's operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of such public health emergency, the extent of any related travel advisories and restrictions implemented, the impact of such public health emergencies on overall supply and demand, goods and services, investor liquidity, consumer confidence and levels of economic activity and the extend of its disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The effects of a public health emergency may materially and adversely impact the value and performance of the Company's investments, the Company's ability to source, manage and divest investments and the Company's ability to achieve its investment objectives, all of which could result in significant losses to the Company. In addition, the operations of the Company may be significantly impacted, or even temporarily or permanently halted, as a result of government quarantine measures, voluntary and precautionary restrictions on travel or meetings and other factors related to a public health emergency, including its potential adverse impact on the health of the Company's personnel.
Recently enacted laws, such as Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or regulations and future changes in the U.S. taxation of businesses may impact our effective tax rate or may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed the Code, including a reduction in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate to 21%, a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, restrictions on the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and dramatic changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, regulations, or other guidance issued under it (including additional technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance yet to be issued) or conforming or non-conforming state tax rules might affect us or our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that U.S. tax laws, including the corporate income tax rate, would not undergo significant changes in the near future.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to advisory agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to remove us as the general partner.
With respect to our permanent capital vehicles, each fund’s investment management agreement must be approved annually by such fund’s board of directors or by the vote of a majority of the stockholders and the majority of the independent members of such fund’s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. In addition, as required by the Investment Company Act, both MCC and SIC have the right to terminate their respective management agreements without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to their respective advisers. Termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 
15

2017, our investment advisory relationships with MCC and SIC represented approximately 68.9%, 69.0% and 74.4%, respectively, of our total management fees. These investment advisory relationships also represented, in the aggregate, 37.5% of our AUM at December 31, 2019. There can be no assurance that our investment management agreements with respect to MCC and SIC will remain in place.
With respect to our long-dated private funds, insofar as we control the general partner of such funds, the risk of termination of the investment management agreement for such funds is limited, subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties as general partner. However, the applicable fund partnership agreements may permit the limited partners of each respective fund to remove us as general partner by a majority or, in certain circumstances, a super majority vote. In addition, the partnership agreements provide for dissolution of the partnership upon certain changes of control. 
Our SMAs are governed by investment management agreements that may be terminated by investors at any time for cause under the applicable agreement and “cause” may include the departure of specified members of our senior management team. Absent cause, the investment management agreements that govern our SMAs are generally not terminable during the specified investment period or following the specified investment period, prior to the scheduled maturities or disposition of the subject AUM.
Termination of these agreements would negatively affect the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.
We may not be able to maintain our current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees. Although our investment management fees vary among and within asset classes, historically we have competed primarily on the basis of our performance and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. In September 2009, the Institutional Limited Partners Association published a set of Private Equity Principles (the “Principles”), which were revised in January 2011. The Principles were developed to encourage discussion between limited partners and general partners regarding private equity fund partnership terms. Certain of the Principles call for enhanced “alignment of interests” between general partners and limited partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements, including proposed guidelines for fees and performance income structures.1 Although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees with respect to our existing funds, we may experience pressure to do so in our funds. More recently institutional investors have been allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies as well as attempting to reduce management and investment fees to external managers, whether through direct reductions, deferrals or rebates. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure. For example, on December 3, 2015, we agreed to reduce our fees from MCC and beginning January 1, 2016, the base management fee from MCC was reduced to 1.50% on gross assets above $1 billion. In addition, we reduced our incentive fee from MCC from 20% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over an 8% hurdle, to 17.5% on pre-incentive fee net investment income over a 6% hurdle and introduced a netting mechanism and incentive fee income will be subject to a rolling three-year look back. Under no circumstances will our recently implemented fee structure result in higher fees from MCC than fees under the current investment management agreement. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations. For more information about our fees, see “Business - Fee Structure."
A change of control of us or Medley Management Inc. could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements.
Pursuant to the Investment Company Act, each of the investment advisory agreements for the BDCs that we advise automatically terminates upon its deemed “assignment” and a BDC’s board and shareholders must approve a new agreement in order for us to continue to act as its investment adviser. In addition, pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act, each of our investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be “assigned” without the consent of the client. A sale of a controlling block of our or Medley Management Inc.'s voting securities and certain other transactions would be deemed an “assignment” pursuant to both the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act. Such an assignment may be deemed to occur in the event that our pre-IPO owners dispose of enough of their interests in us such that they no longer own a controlling interest in us. If such a deemed assignment occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from clients whose funds are managed pursuant to separate accounts or the necessary approvals from the boards and shareholders of the SEC-registered BDCs that we advise. An assignment, actual or constructive, would trigger these termination and consent provisions and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, could materially and adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of assets under management and a corresponding loss of revenue.
16

The historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results.
The historical performance of our funds is relevant to us primarily insofar as it is indicative of fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future and our reputation and ability to raise new funds. Poor performance of the funds we advise could cause a decline in our revenues and could therefore have a negative effect on our operating results. Also, there is no assurance that projections in respect of our funds or unrealized valuations will be realized.
Moreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of these funds or from any future funds we may raise, in part because:

• | market conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than the market conditions we may experience in the future;


• | our funds’ rates of returns, which are calculated on the basis of NAV of the funds’ investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;


• | our funds’ returns have previously benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not recur, and our funds may not be able to achieve the same returns or profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;


• | the historical returns that we present in this Form 10-K derive largely from the performance of our earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed, which may have little or no realized investment track record;


• | in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in alternative funds and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future; and


• | our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital.

The future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described in this Form 10-K, including risks of the industries and business in which a particular fund invests.
If we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
Our growth strategy may include the selective development or acquisition of other asset management businesses, advisory businesses or other businesses or financial products complementary to our business where we think we can add substantial value or generate substantial returns. The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays, (e) our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners and (f) our ability to properly manage conflicts of interest. Moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully complete an acquisition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new business or activities. If we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, our business and results of operations.
We depend on third-party distribution sources to market our investment strategies.
Our ability to grow our AUM, particularly with respect to our BDCs, is dependent on access to third-party intermediaries, including investment banks, broker dealers and RIAs. We cannot assure you that these intermediaries will continue to be accessible to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, pension fund consultants may review and evaluate our institutional products and our firm from time to time. Poor reviews or evaluations of either a particular product, or of us, may result in institutional client withdrawals or may impair our ability to attract new assets through these consultants.
An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.
Our funds have historically invested primarily in privately held companies. Investments in private companies pose certain incremental risks as compared to investments in public companies including that private companies:

• | have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress;

17


• | may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under debt that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;


• | may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger business, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;


• | are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our investee company and, in turn, on us; and


• | generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing business with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. In addition, our executive officers, directors or employees may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our funds’ investments in investee companies.

Finally, limited public information generally exists about private companies and these companies may not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of our funds’ advisors to obtain adequate information through due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness and potential returns from investing in these companies. Additionally, these companies and their financial information will not generally be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, our funds may lose money on such investments. 
Our funds’ investments in investee companies may be risky, and our funds could lose all or part of their investments.
Our funds pursue strategies focused on investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies.
Senior Secured Debt and Second Lien Secured Debt. When our funds invest in senior secured term debt and second lien secured debt, our funds will generally take a security interest in the available assets of these investee companies, including the equity interests of their subsidiaries. There is a risk that the collateral securing such investments may decrease in value over time or lose its entire value, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the investee company to raise additional capital. Also, in some circumstances, our security interest could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in an investee company’s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the debt. Consequently, the fact that debt is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the investment terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the investment should we be forced to enforce our remedies.
Senior Unsecured Debt.  Our funds may also make unsecured debt investments in investee companies, meaning that such investments will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies.
Subordinated Debt.  Our subordinated debt investments will generally be subordinated to senior debt and will generally be unsecured. This may result in a heightened level of risk and volatility or a loss of principal, which could lead to the loss of the entire investment. These investments may involve additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. To the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt may be subject to greater fluctuations in valuations, and such debt could subject our funds to non-cash income. Since the applicable fund would not receive any principal repayments prior to the maturity of some of our subordinated debt investments, such investments will be of greater risk than amortizing loans.
Equity Investments. Certain of our funds make selected equity investments. In addition, when our funds invest in senior and subordinated debt, they may acquire warrants or options to purchase equity securities or benefit from other types of equity participation. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of these equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests our funds receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, our funds may not be able to realize gains from such equity interests, and any gains that our funds do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses our funds experience.
Most loans in which our funds invest will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would be rated as below investment grade quality. Loans rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. From time to time, our funds, in the past, and may in the future, lose some or all of their investment in an investee company.
18

Prepayments of debt investments by our investee companies could adversely impact our results of operations.
We are subject to the risk that the investments our funds make in investee companies may be repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, our BDCs will generally use such proceeds to reduce their existing borrowings and our private funds will generally return such capital to their investors, which capital may be recalled at a later date pursuant to such funds' governing documents. With respect to our SMAs, if such event occurs after the investment period, such capital will be returned to investors. Any future investment in a new investee company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, the results of operations of the affected fund could be materially adversely affected if one or more investee companies elect to prepay amounts owed to such fund, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our funds’ investee companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our funds’ investments in such companies.
Our funds pursue a strategy focused on investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies. Our funds’ investee companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which our funds invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which our funds invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of an investee company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our funds’ investment in that investee company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such investee company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to our funds. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which our funds invest, our funds would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant investee company.
Subordinated liens on collateral securing loans that our funds make to their investee companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and our funds.
Certain debt investments that our funds make in investee companies are secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior secured debt of such companies. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the investee company’s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the company under the agreements governing the debt. The holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before our funds. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens, then our funds, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the investee company’s remaining assets, if any.
Our funds may also make unsecured debt investments in investee companies, meaning that such investments will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on such investee companies’ collateral, if any, will secure the investee company’s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the investee company under its secured debt agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured debt obligations after payment in full of all secured debt obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured debt obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors’ claims against the investee company’s remaining assets, if any.
The rights our funds may have with respect to the collateral securing the debt investments our funds make in their investee companies with senior debt outstanding may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that our funds enter into with the holders of senior secured debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the discretion of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. Our funds may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if their rights are adversely affected.    
19

There may be circumstances where our funds’ debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or our funds could be subject to lender liability claims.
If one of our investee companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which our funds actually provided managerial assistance to that investee company or a representative of us sat on the board of directors of such investee company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our funds’ debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our funds’ claim to that of other creditors. In situations where a bankruptcy carries a high degree of political significance, our funds’ legal rights may be subordinated to other creditors.
In addition, lenders in certain cases can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them when they become too involved in the borrower’s business or exercise control over a borrower. It is possible that we or our funds could become subject to a lender’s liability claim, including as a result of actions taken if we or our funds render significant managerial assistance to, or exercise control or influence over the board of directors of, the borrower.
Our funds may not have the resources or ability to make additional investments in our investee companies.
After an initial investment in an investee company, our funds may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to such company or have the opportunity to increase their investment through the exercise of a warrant or other right to purchase common stock. There is no assurance that the applicable fund will make, or will have sufficient resources to make, follow-on investments. Even if such fund has sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our level of risk, we prefer other opportunities or we are limited in our ability to do so by compliance with BDC requirements or maintaining RIC status, if applicable. Any decisions not to make a follow-on investment or any inability on our part to make such an investment may have a negative impact on an investee company in need of such an investment, may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation or may reduce the expected return on the investment.
Economic recessions or downturns could impair our investee companies and harm our operating results.
Many of our investee companies are susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our funds’ debt investments during these periods. Therefore, our funds’ non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value of our funds’ portfolios are likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of any collateral securing our senior secured or second lien secured debt. A severe recession may further decrease the value of such collateral and result in losses of value in such portfolios. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us on terms we deem acceptable. Occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
A covenant breach by our investee companies may harm our operating results.
An investee company’s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its debt and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize an investee company’s ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity instruments that our funds hold. Our funds may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting investee company. To the extent our funds incur additional costs and/or do not recover their investments in investee companies, we may earn reduced management and incentive fees, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
The investment management business is competitive.
The investment management business is competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. We compete for investors with a number of other investment managers, public and private funds, BDCs, small business investment companies and others. Numerous factors increase our competitive risks, including:

• | a number of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;


• | some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors’ funds or other available investment products;


• | several of our competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited;

20


• | some of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our funds;


• | some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain business or investments than we do and/or bear less compliance expense than we do;


• | some of our competitors may have more flexibility than we have in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;


• | some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do; and


• | other industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.

In addition, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our funds operate in a competitive market for lending that has recently intensified, and competition may limit our funds’ ability to originate or acquire desirable loans and investments and could also affect the yields of these assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our funds operate in a competitive market for lending that has recently intensified. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our funds’ ability to originate or acquire credit investments on attractive terms. In originating or acquiring our target credit investments, we compete with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, BDCs, small business investment companies, REITs, commercial finance and insurance companies and others. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. government. Many of our competitors or their funds are not subject to the operating constraints associated with qualifying as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code or compliance with the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, offer more attractive pricing, transaction structures, covenants or other terms and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in our target assets may lead to the yields of such assets decreasing, which may further limit our ability to generate satisfactory returns. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable loans and investments may be limited in the future and our funds may not be able to take advantage of attractive lending and investment opportunities from time to time, thereby limiting their ability to identify and originate loans or make investments that are consistent with their investment objectives. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures our funds face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Dependence on leverage by certain of our funds and by our funds’ investee companies subjects us to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.
MCC, SIC and our funds’ investee companies rely on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. While our permanent capital vehicles, MCC and SIC, are our only funds that currently rely on the use of leverage, certain of our other funds may in the future rely on the use of leverage. If our funds or the companies in which our funds invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to business generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Any economic downturn could materially and adversely affect the financial resources of our funds and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants.
The absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. Finally, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance our funds’ investments are generally deductible expenses for income tax purposes, subject to limitations under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions, as has been 
21

discussed from time to time in various jurisdictions, would reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
Similarly, our funds’ investee companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets to obtain additional financing for their operations. Our investee companies are typically highly leveraged. Those that have credit ratings are typically non-investment grade and those that do not have credit ratings would likely be non-investment grade if they were rated. If the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those investee companies and, therefore, the investment returns of our funds. In addition, if the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our investee companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs. As of December 31, 2019, MCC and SIC were our only funds that relied on leverage. As of December 31, 2019, MCC had a NAV of $220.6 million, $0.4 billion of AUM and an asset coverage ratio of 206.1%. As of December 31, 2019, SIC had a NAV of $591.1 million, $1.1 billion of AUM and an asset coverage ratio of 279.9%. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss to investors. A fund may borrow money from time to time to make investments or may enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by returns on such investments and may be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such investments. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund’s NAV to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund’s NAV could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. In addition, as BDCs registered under the Investment Company Act, MCC and SIC are each permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage ratio equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. Each of MCC’s and SIC’s ability to pay dividends will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below at least 200% and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our funds make. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Some of our funds may invest in companies that are highly leveraged, which may increase the risk of loss associated with those investments.
Some of our funds may invest in companies whose capital structures involve significant leverage. For example, in many non-distressed private equity investments, indebtedness may be as much as 75% or more of an investee company’s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, whether incurred at or above the investment-level entity. In distressed situations, indebtedness may exceed 100% or more of an investee company’s capitalization. Additionally, the debt positions originated or acquired by our funds may be the most junior in what could be a complex capital structure, and thus subject us to the greatest risk of loss.
Investments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.
Furthermore, the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:

• | subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our funds’ ability to realize value from the investment;


• | allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of our funds’ equity investment in it;


• | give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity’s ability to respond to changing industry conditions if additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;


• | limit the entity’s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;


• | limit the entity’s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and


• | limit the entity’s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.

22

As a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. For example, a number of investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flows precipitated by the subsequent economic downturn during 2008 and 2009.
We generally do not control the business operations of our investee companies and, due to the illiquid nature of our investments, may not be able to dispose of such investments.
Investments by our funds generally consist of debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. We do not expect to control most of our investee companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights, and our debt agreements may impose certain restrictive covenants on our borrowers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that an investee company in which our funds invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. Due to the lack of liquidity for our investments in private companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our investee companies as readily as we would like or at an appropriate valuation. As a result, an investee company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment holdings.
A substantial portion of our investments may be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our respective funds’ boards of directors or similar bodies and, as a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the value of our funds’ investments.
The debt and equity instruments in which our funds invest for which market quotations are not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of such respective funds' boards of directors or similar bodies. Most, if not all, of our funds' investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) are classified as Level III under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This means that our funds’ portfolio valuations will be based on unobservable inputs and our funds’ assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. We expect that inputs into the determination of fair value of our funds’ portfolio investments will require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data were available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimers materially reduces the reliability of such information. Our funds retain the services of an independent service provider to review the valuation of these loans and securities. 
The types of factors that the board of directors, general partner or similar body may take into account in determining the fair value of a fund’s investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly traded securities including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of an investee company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the investee company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the investee company does business and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these loans and securities existed. Our funds’ NAV could be materially and adversely affected if determinations regarding the fair value of such funds’ investments were materially higher than the values that such funds’ ultimately realize upon the disposal of such loans and securities.
We may need to pay “clawback” obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with respect to certain of our funds and SMAs.
Generally, if at the termination of a fund (and sometimes at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. This obligation is known as a “clawback” obligation. Medley received a carried interest distribution of $0.3 million from one of its managed funds, which was liquidated as of December 31, 2019. Prior to the receipt of this distribution during the year ended December 31, 2019, Medley has not received any carried interest, other than tax distributions, a portion of which is subject to clawback. As of December 31, 2019, we recorded a $7.2 million clawback obligation that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Had we assumed all existing investments were worthless as of December 31, 2019, there would be no additional amounts subject to clawback. 
Although a clawback obligation is several to each person who received a distribution, and not a joint obligation, the governing agreements of our funds generally provide that, if a recipient does not fund his or her respective share, we may have to fund such additional amounts beyond the amount of carried interest we retained, although we generally will retain the right to pursue remedies 
23

against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. We may need to use or reserve cash to repay such clawback obligations instead of using the cash for other purposes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contingent Obligations.”
Our funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments.
While diversification is generally an objective of our funds, there can be no assurance as to the degree of diversification, if any, that will be achieved in any fund investments. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a fund if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. This lack of diversification may expose a fund to losses disproportionate to economic conditions or market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse movements in the particular investments. If a fund holds investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class or geographic region, such fund may be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment portfolio to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could materially adversely affect a fund’s performance and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition. 
Third-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could materially adversely affect a fund’s operations and performance.
Investors in our private funds make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when we call capital from them for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations when due. Any investor that did not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including having a meaningful amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby limiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. Third-party investors in private funds often use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third-party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. A failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds could have a material adverse effect on the operation and performance of those funds.
Our funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.
Our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund’s term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, and the general partners of the funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, our funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.
Hedging strategies may materially and adversely affect the returns on our funds’ investments.
When managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps (including total return swaps), caps, collars, floors, foreign currency forward contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option contracts or other strategies. The success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market or foreign exchange changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into a transaction to reduce our or a fund’s exposure to market risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.
While such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when we or a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that may reduce the returns generated by a fund. Finally, the CFTC has made several public statements that it may soon issue a proposal for certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the cost of entering into currency hedges. 
24

Our business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from investors. If we were unable to raise such capital, we would be unable to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control. Investors may downsize their investment allocations to credit focused private funds or BDCs or to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. Poor performance of our funds could also make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our funds’ performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds depends on our funds’ performance. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of future funds. If we were unable to successfully raise capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.
We depend on our senior management team, senior investment professionals and other key personnel, and our ability to retain them and attract additional qualified personnel is critical to our success and our growth prospects.
We depend on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of our senior management team, including Brook Taube and Seth Taube, our co-Chief Executive Officers, senior investment professionals and other key personnel. Our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our senior professionals and other key personnel and our ability to recruit additional qualified personnel. These individuals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing our funds’ investments, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the source of many of our funds’ investment opportunities and, in certain cases, have strong relationships with our investors. Therefore, if any of our senior professionals or other key personnel join competitors or form competing companies, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing investors.
The departure for any reason of any of our senior professionals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives, cause certain of our investors to withdraw capital they invest with us or elect not to commit additional capital to our funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects. The departure of some or all of those individuals could also trigger certain “key man” provisions in the documentation governing certain of our funds, which would permit the investors in those funds to suspend or terminate such funds’ investment periods or, in the case of certain funds, permit investors to withdraw their capital prior to expiration of the applicable lock-up date. We do not carry any “key man” insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our senior professionals, and we do not have a policy that prohibits our senior professionals from traveling together.
We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals both to grow our business and to replace those who depart. However, the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or we may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our efforts to retain and attract investment professionals may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability or result in an increase in the portion of our performance fees that we grant to our investment professionals.
Our failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
As we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our business activities, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds’ investment activities. Certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives, including funds that have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds. For example, a decision to receive material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action.
In most cases, Medley is permitted to co-invest among our private funds, our SMAs, our public business development companies and other advisory clients pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC. We have adopted an order aggregation and trade allocation policy designed to ensure that all of our clients are treated fairly and to prevent this form of conflict from influencing the allocation of investment opportunities among clients. Allocations will generally be made pro rata principally based on each fund or advisory client's capital available for investment. It is Medley's policy to base its determinations as to the amounts of capital available for investment on such factors as: the amount of cash on hand, existing capital commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, the targeted asset mix and diversification requirements and other investment policies and restrictions or otherwise imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.
We may also cause different funds to invest in a single investee company, for example, where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest. We may also cause different funds that we advise to purchase different classes 
25

of investments or securities in the same investee company. For example, certain of our funds hold minority equity interests, or have the right to acquire such equity interests, in some of our investee companies. As a result, we may face conflicts of interests in connection with making business decisions for these investee companies to the extent that such decisions affect the debt and equity holders in these investee companies differently. In addition, we may face conflicts of interests in connection with making investment or other decisions, including granting loan waivers or concessions with respect to these investee companies given that we also manage private funds that may hold equity interests in these investee companies. In addition, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us and our funds. Though we believe we have developed appropriate policies and procedures to resolve these conflicts, our judgment on any particular allocation could be challenged. If we fail to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us.
Actions by activist investors relating to our affiliates can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Stockholder activism could create perceived uncertainties, which could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. Furthermore, stockholder activism could adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement strategic plans, including in connection with the proposed mergers.
Growth of our business may be difficult to sustain and may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.
Our assets under management have grown significantly in the past and we are pursuing further growth. Our growth has placed, and planned growth, if successful, will continue to place, significant demands on our legal, compliance, accounting and operational infrastructure, and has increased expenses associated with all of the foregoing. In addition, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting, regulatory and tax developments. Our future growth will depend in part on our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, we face significant challenges:

• | in maintaining adequate financial, regulatory (legal, tax and compliance) and business controls;


• | in implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures; and


• | in training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely and cost-effective basis.

We may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.
We may enter into new lines of business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and business, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.
We intend to grow our business by increasing assets under management in existing business and, if market conditions warrant, by expanding into complementary investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. Attempts to expand our business involve a number of special risks, including some or all of the following:

• | the required investment of capital and other resources;


• | the assumption of liabilities in any acquired business;


• | the disruption of our ongoing business;


• | entry into markets or lines of business in which we may have limited or no experience;


• | increasing demands on our operational and management systems and controls;


• | compliance with additional regulatory requirements;


• | potential increase in investor concentration; and


• | the broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently have no presence.

26

Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. Because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or lines of business, we cannot identify for you all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and your investment that may result from any attempted expansion.
Extensive regulation affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The SEC oversees the activities of our subsidiaries that are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. In addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Investment Company Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to us, we could be subject to regulatory action or third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The SEC has indicated that investment advisers who receive transaction-based compensation for investment banking or acquisition activities relating to fund investee companies may be required to register as broker-dealers. Specifically, the SEC staff has noted that if a firm receives fees from a fund investee company in connection with the acquisition, disposition or recapitalization of such investee company, such activities could raise broker-dealer concerns under applicable regulations related to broker dealers. If we receive such transaction fees and the SEC takes the position that such activities render us a “broker” under the applicable rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, we could be subject to additional regulation. If receipt of transaction fees from an investee company is determined to require a broker-dealer license, receipt of such transaction fees in the past or in the future during any time when we did not or do not have a broker-dealer license could subject us to liability for fines, penalties, damages or other remedies.
Since 2010, certain states and other regulatory authorities have begun to require investment managers to register as lobbyists in connection with their solicitation of commitments from governmental entities, including state and municipal pension funds. We have registered as such in a number of jurisdictions, including California and New York. Other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect. These registration requirements impose significant compliance obligations and restrictions on registered lobbyists and their employers, which may include annual registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping, and may also prohibit the payment of contingent fees.
Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Investment Advisers Act, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. We are involved regularly in trading activities that implicate a broad number of U.S. securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.
Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of the registration of our relevant subsidiaries as investment advisers or registered broker-dealers. The regulations to which our business is subject are designed primarily to protect investors in our funds and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect MDLY stockholders. Even if a sanction imposed against us, one of our subsidiaries or our personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm our reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business in a number of ways, making it harder for us to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with us.
Failure to comply with “pay to play” regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the “pay to play” regulatory regimes, could adversely affect our business.
In recent years, the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. In June 2010, the SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Investment 
27

Advisers Act regarding “pay to play” practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser’s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding “pay to play” practices by investment advisers.
As a number of public pension plans are investors in our funds, these rules could impose significant economic sanctions on our business if we or one of the other persons covered by the rules make any such contribution or payment, whether or not material or with an intent to secure an investment from a public pension plan. In addition, such investigations may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines or forfeitures of fees paid and an obligation to provide services without payment of fees if any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on our part to comply with these rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.
New or changed laws or regulations governing our funds’ operations and changes in the interpretation thereof could adversely affect our business.
The laws and regulations governing the operations of our funds, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by our funds to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, assets under management or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. See “Business - Regulatory and Compliance Matters” for a discussion of our regulatory and compliance environment. The following includes the most significant regulatory risks facing our business:
Changes in capital requirements may increase the cost of our financing.
If regulatory capital requirements - whether under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), Basel III, or other regulatory action - were to be imposed on our funds, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to others. Among other things, this could potentially require our funds to sell assets at an inopportune time or price, which could negatively impact our operations, assets under management or financial condition.
The imposition of additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability.
In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers. Importantly, while numerous key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been defined through final rules, additional regulations thereunder or amendments thereunder may continue to be implemented by various regulatory bodies in the future. While we already have several subsidiaries registered as investment advisers subject to SEC examinations, the imposition of any additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely affect our profitability.
The implementation of the Volcker Rule could have adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from certain entities.
In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies adopted a final rule implementing a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that has become known as the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities, regardless of geographic location, from investing in or sponsoring “covered funds,” which include private equity funds or hedge funds and certain other proprietary activities. The Volcker Rule may have the effect of further curtailing various banking activities that in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets as well as our business. Although we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely affect our fundraising to any significant extent, there remains uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Volcker Rule and its practical implications (including as a result of the long-term effects of the Volcker Rule, as well as potential changes to the rule in light of the OCC's August 2017 solicitation of public comments on how the rule should be revised to better accomplish its purpose), and there could be adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition.
28

Increased regulation on banks’ leveraged lending activities could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to our funds and their investee companies.
In March 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published revised guidance regarding expectations for banks’ leveraged lending activities. This guidance, and related or similar regulations restrict credit availability, as well as potentially restrict certain of our investing activities that rely on banks’ lending activities. This could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to our funds and their investee companies.
New restrictions on compensation could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals.
The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions. Such restrictions could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives.
Regulatory uncertainty could negatively impact our ability to efficiently project, plan and operate our business impacting profitability. 
In early February 2017, the Trump administration issued an executive order calling for a review of laws and regulations affecting the U.S. financial industry in order to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the executive order. Several bills are pending in Congress that, if enacted, would amend the Dodd-Frank Act. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act was enacted into law in 2018. The Administration has expressed support for such proposals and encouraged the House and Senate to work together to present legislation to the President as quickly as possible. Such enacted and pending legislation could change the process and criteria for designating systemically important financial institutions, modify the Volcker Rule and make reforms to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, among other amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act.
It is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. In addition, as a result of proposed legislation, shifting areas of focus of regulatory enforcement bodies or otherwise, regulatory compliance practices may shift such that formerly accepted industry practices become disfavored or less common. Any changes or other developments in the regulatory framework applicable to our businesses, including the changes described above and changes to formerly accepted industry practices, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our funds. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and materially and adversely affect our profitability.
Present and future BDCs for which we serve as investment adviser are subject to regulatory complexities that limit the way in which they do business and may subject them to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny.
MCC and SIC, and other BDCs for which we may serve as investment adviser in the future, operate under a complex regulatory environment. Such BDCs require the application of complex tax and securities regulations and may entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, regulations affecting BDCs generally affect their ability to take certain actions. For example, each of MCC and SIC has elected to be treated as a RIC for United States federal income tax purposes. To maintain their status as a RIC, such vehicles must meet, among other things, certain source of income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. If any of our BDCs fails to qualify for RIC tax treatment for any reason and remains or becomes subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could, among other things, substantially reduce such BDC’s net assets.
In addition, MCC and SIC are subject to complex rules under the Investment Company Act, including rules that restrict certain of our funds from engaging in transactions with MCC and SIC. Under the regulatory and business environment in which they operate, MCC and SIC must periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments in excess of their repayments to grow. This results from MCC and SIC each being required to generally distribute to their respective stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income to maintain its RIC status, combined with regulations under the Investment Company Act that, subject to certain exceptions, generally prohibit MCC and SIC from issuing and selling their common stock at a price below NAV per share and from incurring indebtedness (including for this purpose, preferred stock), if their asset coverage, as calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, equals less than 200% after such incurrence. If our BDCs are found to be in violation of the Investment Company Act, they could lose their status as BDCs. If either of our BDCs fails to continuously qualify as a BDC, such BDC might be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, 
29

which would significantly decrease its operating flexibility. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against such BDC, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
We are subject to risks in using custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents.
Some of our funds depend on the services of custodians, counterparties, administrators, prime brokers and other agents to carry out certain financing, securities and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight, although the Dodd-Frank Act provides for new regulation of the derivatives market. In particular, some of our funds utilize arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of such funds with these counterparties.
Our funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.
In addition, our risk-management process may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.
Although we have risk-management processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single counterparty for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. For example, some of our funds have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.
In the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of our contracts, one or more of our funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our business, results of operation and financial condition.
In the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker’s, custodian’s or counterparty’s unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, our funds’ cash held with a prime broker, custodian or counterparty generally will not be segregated from the prime broker’s, custodian’s or counterparty’s own cash, and our funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. If our derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared and uncleared swaps. The CFTC is also working to provide new guidance regarding prime broker arrangements and intermediation generally with regard to trading on swap execution facilities.
The counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. For example, the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties. Our funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties have generally reacted to recent market volatility by tightening their underwriting standards and increasing their margin requirements for all categories of financing, which has the result of decreasing the overall amount of leverage available and increasing the costs of borrowing.
A portion of our revenue and cash flow is variable, which may impact our ability to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis.
We believe that base management fees are consistent and predictable. For all periods presented, over 40% of total revenues was derived from base management fees. Due to our investment strategy and the nature of our fees, a portion of our revenue and cash flow is variable, due primarily to the fact that the performance fees from our long-dated private funds and SMAs can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total revenue of $65.0 million included a reversal of performance fees of $2.0 million. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, we did not recognize any performance fees in 2019 or 2018, as we determined that it was not probable that a significant reversal of such fees would not occur in the future. Additionally, we may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds’ investments, changes in our operating 
30

expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period.
We may be subject to litigation risks and may face liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result.
In recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against investment managers have been increasing. We make investment decisions on behalf of investors in our funds that could result in substantial losses. This may subject us to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. Further, we may be subject to third-party litigation arising from allegations that we improperly exercised control or influence over portfolio investments. In addition, we and our affiliates that are the investment managers and general partners of our funds, our funds themselves and those of our employees who are our, our subsidiaries’ or the funds’ officers and directors are each exposed to the risks of litigation specific to the funds’ investment activities and investee companies and, in the case where our funds own controlling interests in public companies, to the risk of shareholder litigation by the public companies’ other shareholders. Moreover, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors or regulators relating to our having engaged, or our funds having engaged, in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed. 
Legal liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm our business. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the investment industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be damaging to our business.
Employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our investee companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our business.
Our ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds depends heavily upon the reputation of our professionals, especially our senior professionals. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our investment management business and our authority over the assets managed by our investment management business. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees could adversely affect investors in our funds and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which our funds may invest. If our employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one or more of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result, which would adversely impact our ability to raise future funds.
In addition, we could be adversely affected as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by personnel of investee companies in which our funds invest. For example, failures by personnel at our investee companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions or other legal and regulatory requirements could expose us to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise adversely affect our business and reputation. Such misconduct could undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and could negatively affect the valuation of a fund’s investments.
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts or raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.
We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized discount, premium, and issuance costs, was approximately $142.2 million. Our substantial debt obligations could have important consequences, including:

• | requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations and pursue future business opportunities;


• | exposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise;


• | exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest;


• | making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including any restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;

31


• | increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;


• | restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;


• | limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, product development, satisfaction of debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and


• | limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.

Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.
Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives.
Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.
Although we terminated our prior $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility in May 2019, we may enter into a new revolving or other credit facility in the future or incur significant other or additional indebtedness in the future. Additional indebtedness incurred by the Company from time to time or at any time in the future could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase. 
Operational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses or limit our growth.
Our business relies heavily on financial, accounting and other information systems and technology. We face various security threats, including cyber security attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems. These security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties outside of Medley. Although we have not yet been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled for any reason or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of our network security systems, a cyber-incident or attack or otherwise, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.
In addition, our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining the systems may increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to the information systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Furthermore, we depend on our office in New York, where a substantial portion of our personnel are located, for the continued operation of our business. An earthquake or other disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Although we have disaster recovery programs in place, these may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.
Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems, technology and administration of our funds and compliance matters. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of our funds’ operations and could impact our reputation, adversely affect our business and limit our ability to grow.
32

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. 
Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. 
We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an accelerated filer as defined in the Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. Matters impacting our internal control may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements would also suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting.
Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for United States federal and state income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) were to treat us as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, or if we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, then our cash available for payments on our debt obligations could be substantially reduced.
 It is possible, in certain circumstances, for us to be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe that we are or will be (or should have been) so treated, if we were treated as a “publicly traded partnership,” we might be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. If we were taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, it would pay United States federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Therefore, our treatment as a corporation would result in a material reduction in its anticipated cash flow and could materially adversely affect its ability to make payments on our debt obligations. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce our cash available for payments on debt obligations. 
Legislation could subject us to federal income tax liability.
 Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our federal income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for payments on our debt obligations may be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable to us for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.
Although the Notes are listed on the NYSE, an active trading market for the Notes may not develop, which could limit the market price of the Notes or your ability to sell them.
Although the Notes are listed on the NYSE, we cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market will develop or be sustained for the Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes. The market price of the Notes may decline depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. We cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop or be sustained for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not develop, the liquidity and trading price for the Notes may be harmed.
A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or the Notes, if any, or change in the debt markets could cause the liquidity or market value of the Notes to decline significantly.
Any credit ratings assigned by a rating agency to us are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the Notes. These credit 
33

ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Notes. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion. Neither we nor any agent undertakes any obligation to maintain any credit ratings assigned to us or the Notes or to advise holders of Notes of any changes in our credit ratings. The conditions of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the Notes.
Risks Relating to the Mergers 
On July 29, 2019, the Company entered into the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, pursuant to which MDLY and the Company will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the MDLY Merger. Pursuant to the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, MCC will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, merge with and into Sierra, with Sierra as the surviving company in the MCC Merger. Pursuant to terms of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, the consummation of the MCC Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to closing under the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the consummation of the MDLY Merger. However, pursuant to the terms of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, the consummation of the MDLY Merger is not conditioned upon the consummation of the MCC Merger. If the Mergers are or only the MDLY Merger is consummated, Sierra’s common stock will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol “SRA”, with such listing expected to be effective as of the closing date of the Mergers, or the MDLY Merger, as applicable. If the MCC Merger is also consummated, Sierra's common stock will be listed on the TASE, with such listing expected to be effective as of the closing date of the Mergers. Upon completion of both of the Mergers, the investment portfolios of the Company and Sierra would be combined, Merger Sub, as a successor to MDLY, would be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Combined Company, and the Combined Company would be internally managed by its wholly controlled adviser subsidiary. If the MDLY Merger is consummated and the MCC Merger is not consummated, Sierra’s common stock would be listed on the NYSE (but not the TASE), and the investment portfolios of MCC and Sierra would not be combined. Set forth below are certain risks relating to the Mergers. For more information, please refer to Medley Management Inc.'s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A that will be filed with the SEC when available.
The completion of the Mergers is subject to several conditions, including, the receipt of SEC exemptive relief and, with respect to the MCC Merger, court approval of the Settlement. There can be no assurances when or if the Mergers will be completed.
Although the Company, MDLY, Sierra, and MCC expect to complete the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, as early as the first quarter of 2020, there can be no assurances as to the exact timing of completion of the MCC Merger and/or the MDLY Merger, applicable, or that the Mergers will be completed at all. The completion of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, is subject to numerous conditions, including, among others, the continued effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form N-14; the approval of Sierra’s common stock (including the Settlement Shares (as defined in the Amended MCC Merger Agreement) and the shares of Sierra’s common stock to be issued in the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, applicable for listing on the NYSE; receipt of requisite approvals of each of MDLY's stockholders, Sierra’s stockholders, and MCC’s stockholders; receipt of required regulatory approvals, including from the SEC (including necessary exemptive relief to consummate the Mergers); the settlement of the Delaware Action in accordance with the Settlement; any necessary approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, amended, and, if applicable, state securities regulators; there being no recession of the confirmation that Merger Sub, as the surviving company in the MDLY Merger, will be treated as a portfolio investment of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable, and reflected in the Combined Company’s or the Sierra/MDLY Company’s, as applicable, consolidated financial statements at fair value for accounting purposes (i.e., not consolidated into the financial statements of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable); the relevant parties having taken all actions reasonably required in order to keep existing indebtedness outstanding following the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable; receipt of necessary consents relating to joint ventures of Sierra and MCC; receipt of a specified level of consents from third-party advisory clients of the Company; with respect to the MCC Merger, satisfaction (or appropriate wavier) of the conditions to closing of the MDLY Merger; and other customary closing conditions. There is no assurance that any of the foregoing conditions will be satisfied. 
MDLY, Sierra, and MCC cannot assure their respective stockholders that the conditions required to complete the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, will be satisfied or waived on the anticipated schedule, or at all. If the Mergers are or the MDLY Merger is, as applicable, not completed, the resulting failure of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s, Sierra’s, and MCC’s financial condition, results of operations, assets or business. In addition, if the Mergers are not completed, the Company, Sierra, and MCC will have incurred substantial expenses for which 
34

no ultimate benefit will have been received. See “If the MDLY Merger does not close, we will not benefit from the expenses incurred in connection therewith” below. Moreover, if either the Amended MCC Merger Agreement or the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company, Sierra, or MCC may be obligated to pay the other party to the applicable merger agreement a termination fee. See “Under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee upon termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement.” Any decision that MDLY's stockholders, Sierra’s stockholders, and MCC’s stockholders make should be made with the understanding that the completion of the Mergers may not happen as scheduled, or at all.
If the Mergers are completed, certain additional risks regarding the Combined Company following the Mergers may be presented. In addition, if the MDLY Merger is completed and the MCC Merger is not completed certain additional risks regarding the Sierra/MDLY Company following the MDLY Merger may be presented.
Because the NAV of Sierra may change, MDLY stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the stock portion of the merger consideration, they will receive until the MDLY Merger effective time.
Under the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, the MDLY exchange ratios and the cash consideration amount was fixed on July 29, 2019, the date of the signing of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement. The MDLY exchange ratios and the cash consideration amount are not subject to adjustment based on changes in the NAV of Sierra or the market price of MDLY Class A common stock before the MDLY Merger effective time, provided that the MDLY Merger is consummated by March 31, 2020, or, if consummated after March 31, 2020, only if the parties subsequently agree to extend the closing date on the same terms and conditions.
Accordingly, at the time of the MDLY stockholder meeting, MDLY stockholders will not know or be able to calculate with certainty the value of the merger consideration they would receive upon the completion of the MDLY Merger and such value may vary materially from the value of the merger consideration determined as of the date the MDLY Merger was announced, as of the date that the subsequent proxy supplement describing the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement is mailed to MDLY's stockholders, and as of the date of the special meeting of MDLY's stockholders. Any change in the NAV of Sierra prior to completion of the MDLY Merger will affect the value (either positively or negatively) of the merger consideration to be paid by Sierra, and to be received by MDLY's stockholders upon the completion of the MDLY Merger relative to the value of the merger consideration determined as of the date the MDLY Merger was announced. 
The value of the stock portion of the merger consideration that MDLY's stockholders will receive upon the completion of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, may be affected, either positively or negatively, by the trading performance of Sierra’s common stock following the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable.
There is currently no public trading market for Sierra’s common stock and there is no way to predict with certainty how the shares of Sierra’s common stock, including the shares of Sierra’s common stock to be issued in the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, will trade following consummation of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable. Any change in the trading price of Sierra’s common stock following completion of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, will affect the value (either positively or negatively) of the stock portion of the merger consideration received by MDLY's stockholders upon the completion of the MDLY Merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among other things:

• | changes in the business, operations or prospects of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable;


• | the financial condition of current or prospective portfolio companies of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable;


• | interest rates or general market or economic conditions;


• | the supply and demand for the Combined Company’s common stock or the Sierra/MDLY Company’s common stock, as applicable; and


• | market perception of the future probability of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable.

These factors are generally beyond the control of MDLY, Sierra, and MCC prior to completion of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, and, following completion of both of the Mergers or only the MDLY Merger, will generally be beyond the control of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable. As noted above, there is currently no public trading market for Sierra’s common stock and there is no way to predict with certainty how the shares of Sierra’s common stock will trade following consummation of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable. During the 12-month period ending December 31, 2019, the NAV per share of Sierra’s common stock varied from a low of $5.78 to a high of $6.72 and the closing 
35

price per share of our Class A common stock varied from a low of $2.33 to a high of $4.94. However, the historical NAV per share of Sierra, and the historic trading prices of MDLY Class A common stock, are not necessarily indicative of future performance of Sierra’s common stock following the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable.
The inability of Sierra, MCC and/or MDLY to obtain certain third-party consents and approvals could delay or prevent the completion of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable.
Pursuant to the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, each of Sierra’s and MDLY's obligations to complete the MDLY Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, and in addition to the regulatory approvals described below (see “The completion of the Mergers is subject to several conditions, including, the receipt of SEC exemptive relief and, with respect to the MCC Merger, court approval of the Settlement. There can be no assurances when or if the Mergers will be completed”), prior receipt by MDLY of written consents to the continuation, following the MDLY Merger effective time, of the advisory relationship with private funds and managed accounts representing 65% of the Company’s total revenues from private funds and managed accounts for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2018. In addition to the foregoing mutual conditions for closing, Sierra and MDLY must obtain all consents and approvals, and take all necessary steps, in order to keep their respective indebtedness outstanding following the MDLY Merger effective time. Although Sierra and MDLY expect that all such approvals and consents will be obtained and remain in effect and all conditions related to such consents will be satisfied, if they are not, the closing of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, could be significantly delayed, only the MDLY Merger may occur, or both Mergers may not occur at all.
Pursuant to the Amended MCC Merger Agreement, each of Sierra’s and MCC’s obligations to complete the MCC Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, and in addition to the regulatory approvals described below (see “The completion of the Mergers is subject to several conditions, including, the receipt of SEC exemptive relief and, with respect to the MCC Merger, court approval of the Settlement. There can be no assurances when or if the Mergers will be completed”), the prior receipt by Sierra or MCC, as applicable, of third party consents and approvals relating to the joint venture arrangements of Sierra and MCC. In addition, each of Sierra’s and MCC’s obligations to complete the MCC Merger is conditioned upon completion of the MDLY Merger, pursuant to the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, having received written consents to the continuation, following the MDLY Merger effective time, of the advisory relationship with private funds and managed accounts representing 65% of the Company’s total revenues from private funds and managed accounts for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2018. In addition to the foregoing mutual conditions for closing, Sierra and MCC must obtain also, and take all necessary steps, in order to keep their respective indebtedness outstanding following the MCC Merger effective time. Although Sierra and MCC expect that all such approvals and consents will be obtained and remain in effect and all conditions related to such consents will be satisfied, if they are not, the closing of the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, could be significantly delayed, only the MDLY Merger may occur, or both Mergers may not occur at all.
The opinion obtained by MDLY's special committee from its financial advisor will not reflect changes in circumstances after the date of the opinion between signing of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the MDLY Merger effective time.
Our special committee has not obtained updated opinions from its financial advisor and does not anticipating obtaining updated opinions prior to the MDLY Merger effective time. Changes in the operations and prospects of the Company and Sierra, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of MDLY or Sierra, and on which MDLY's special committee’s financial advisor’s opinion was based may significantly alter the value of Sierra or MDLY or the prices at which shares of MDLY's Class A common stock trade or the NAV per share of Sierra’s common stock by the time the MDLY Merger is completed. The opinion of such financial advisor speaks only to the date such opinion was rendered and do not speak as of the time the MDLY Merger will be completed or as of any other date. MDLY's special committee does not expect to obtain an updated opinion from its financial advisor. 
The MDLY Merger consideration was the product of extensive negotiations among the special committees of the Company and Sierra and therefore may include business considerations beyond share price, NAV or other financial or valuation metrics relating to the Company and Sierra.
The MDLY Merger was the product of extensive negotiations among the parties and each special committee considered a number of factors in determining to enter into the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement. As a result, the terms of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement are not necessarily reflective of the share price, NAV or other financial or valuation metrics relating to MDLY and Sierra at the time the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement was entered into, and may reflect additional business considerations.

We have been named as a defendant in various securities class action and derivative lawsuits, and may be named in additional ones in the future, which has resulted in, and which may result in the future, substantial costs and may delay or prevent the completion of the Mergers.
The Company is currently a defendant in the New York Actions and the Delaware Action. For more information about such legal proceedings, see "Item 3, Legal Proceedings." The Company may be a target of additional securities class action and derivative lawsuits. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements in an effort to enjoin the merger or seek monetary relief from such companies. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or others, if any, nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve any such litigation. An unfavorable resolution of any such litigation surrounding the Mergers could delay or prevent their consummation. In addition, the costs defending the litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial and such litigation could distract us from pursuing the consummation of the Mergers and other potentially beneficial business opportunities. It is a condition of the MCC Merger that the Delaware Action be settled in accordance with the terms of the Settlement.
If the MDLY Merger does not close, we will not benefit from the expenses incurred in connection therewith.
The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the Mergers. The MDLY Merger may not be completed. If the MDLY Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. We have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the MDLY Merger for investment banking, legal and accounting fees and financial printing and other costs and expenses, much of which will be incurred even if the MDLY Merger is not completed. In addition, depending upon the circumstances surrounding termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, as applicable, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee to the other party to the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement. See “Under certain circumstances, the Company or Sierra may be obligated to pay a termination fee upon termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement” below.
Failure to complete the MDLY Merger could negatively impact the business, financial results, and ability to pay dividends and distributions, if any or at its current level, to MDLY's stockholders, and negatively impact MDLY's stock prices.
If the MDLY Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected.  We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our creditors and customers if the anticipated benefits of the MDLY Merger are not able to be realized. Such anticipated benefits include, among others, the expected increase in distributions to the stockholders of the Combined Company, the benefits of the larger balance sheet of the Combined Company and potential for greater scale, the fee earning potential of Merger Sub's asset management business, the enhanced market value of Sierra’s common stock following the completion of the Mergers upon listing on the NYSE and the TASE (in connection with the MCC Merger), and the benefits of operational efficiencies, cost savings, and synergies. If the Mergers are not consummated, we cannot assure MDLY's stockholders that the risks described above will not negatively impact the business, financial results, and ability to pay dividends and distributions, if any or at its current level to MDLY's stockholders, and negatively impact MDLY's stock prices.
Termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement or failure to otherwise complete the MDLY Merger could negatively impact us.
Termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement or any failure to otherwise complete the MDLY Merger may result in various consequences, including:

• | our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the MDLY Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the MDLY Merger;


• | the market price of MDLY's Class A common stock may decline to the extent that the market price prior to termination reflects a market assumption that the MDLY Merger will be completed;


• | in the case of the Company, it may not be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price Sierrs have agreed to pay in the MDLY Merger; and


• | the payment of any termination fee, if required under the circumstances, could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity.

Under certain circumstances, Sierra or the Company may be obligated to pay a termination fee upon termination of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement.
The Amended MDLY Merger Agreement provides for the payment by Sierra or the Company to the other party a termination fee of $3,000,000 in cash if the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company or Sierra under certain circumstances.
The Amended MDLY Merger Agreement limits our ability to actively pursue alternatives to the MDLY Merger and to accept a superior proposal from third parties, although MCC had the right to actively pursue alternatives during the go-shop period.
The Amended MDLY Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit the Company’s ability to actively solicit, discuss or negotiate competing third-party proposals for strategic transactions. Although these provisions, which are customary for transactions of this type, allows us to engage in negotiations regarding, and to ultimately accept, a “Superior Proposal” (as such term is defined in the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement) in certain circumstances, subject to the payment of a termination fee, such provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing a “Superior Proposal” to us, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.
In certain circumstances, Sierra, MCC, and the Company may waive one or more conditions to the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable, or amend the Amended MCC Merger Agreement or the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, without resoliciting stockholder approval.
Certain conditions to Sierra’s and MDLY’s obligations to complete the MDLY Merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement of Sierra and MDLY. In addition, certain conditions to Sierra’s and MCC’s obligations to complete the MCC Merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement of Sierra and MCC. In the event that any such waiver does not require re-solicitation of stockholders, the parties to the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the Amended MCC Merger Agreement will have the discretion to complete the MDLY Merger and the MCC Merger, respectively, without seeking further stockholder approval. However, certain conditions, such as the conditions requiring the approval of Sierra’s stockholders, MCC’s stockholders and MDLY’s stockholders, are required under applicable law or the applicable company’s charter documents and may not be waived.
The Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the Amended MCC Merger Agreement may be amended by the respective parties at any time before or after receipt of approval by Sierra’s stockholders, MDLY’s stockholders, or MCC’s stockholders, as the case may be; provided, however, that after receipt of the relevant stockholder approvals, there may not be any amendment of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement or the Amended MCC Merger Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law or its charter documents of the relevant stockholders without receipt of such further approvals.
In addition to the foregoing, waiver or amendment of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement requires the consent of MCC to the extent such waiver or amendment would adversely affect the economic or other rights or interests of MCC and MCC’s stockholders under the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement in any material respect. Conversely, waiver or amendment of the Amended MCC Merger Agreement requires the consent of MDLY to the extent such waiver or amendment would adversely affect the economic or other rights or interests of MDLY and its stockholders under the Amended MCC Merger Agreement in any material respect. 
Certain persons related to us have interests in the Mergers that differ from the interests of MDLY's stockholders.
Certain of our directors and executive officers have financial interests in the Mergers that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of MDLY's stockholders. MDLY’s special committee, comprised solely of the independent directors of MDLY's Board of Directors, and, acting on the recommendation of MDLY’s special committee, MDLY board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement, including the MDLY Merger, and in recommending to MDLY's stockholders to approve the adoption of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement.
We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Mergers are pending.
Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers may have an adverse effect on us and, consequently, on the Combined Company following completion of the Mergers or the Sierra/MDLY Company if only the MDLY Merger is completed. These uncertainties 
38

could cause those that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. In addition, each of the Amended MDLY Merger Agreement and the Amended MCC Merger Agreement restricts us from taking actions that we might otherwise consider to be in our best interests. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Mergers.
The shares of Sierra’s common stock to be received by MDLY's stockholders as a result of the MDLY Merger will have different rights associated with them than shares of our common stock currently held by them.
The rights associated with MDLY common stock are different from the rights associated with Sierra’s common stock following the Mergers or the MDLY Merger, as applicable. 
The MDLY Merger and the MCC Merger are conditioned on the Company, Sierra, MCC and certain of its affiliates receiving exemptive relief from the SEC.
The MDLY Merger and the MCC Merger are conditioned on MDLY, Sierra, MCC, and certain of their affiliates, as applicable, receiving exemptive relief from the SEC from: (i) Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(1), (2), and (4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder because the Mergers would involve a joint arrangement among two affiliated BDCs and their investment advisers and (ii) Sections 12(d)(3) and 60 of the 1940 Act because, in connection with the MDLY Merger, the Company, a registered investment adviser, will be become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable. In addition, Sierra and certain of its affiliates are requesting exemptive relief from the SEC from Sections 23(a), 23(b), 23(c), and 63 and pursuant to Section 61(a)(3)(B) and Sections 57(a)(4) and 57(i) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder that would permit the Combined Company or the Sierra/MDLY Company, as applicable, to grant stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units in exchange for and in recognition of services by its directors, executive officers and employees. There can be no assurance if or when MDLY, Sierra and MCC will receive the exemptive relief.
MDLY stockholders could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities as a result of the MDLY Merger being a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and MDLY's stockholders may not receive cash sufficient to pay any tax.
MDLY and Sierra anticipate that the MDLY Merger will be a taxable transaction. The parties have not requested, and it is not a condition of the MDLY Merger for the parties to receive, a tax opinion with respect to the MDLY Merger. MDLY stockholders could be subject to certain U.S. federal income tax consequences and, among others, the MDLY Merger will result in the recognition of gain or loss to MDLY stockholders in the amount equal to the difference between their tax basis in their shares of MDLY Class A common stock and the value of the MDLY Merger consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because MDLY stockholders will receive only a portion of the MDLY Merger consideration in the form of cash, MDLY stockholders may need to sell Sierra’s common stock received in the MDLY Merger, or use cash from other sources, to pay any tax obligations resulting from the MDLY Merger in excess of the cash received as part of the MDLY Merger consideration. MDLY stockholders will receive a new tax basis in the shares of Sierra’s common stock they receive (initially equal to the value of such shares at the time of the MDLY Merger) for calculation of gain or loss upon their ultimate disposition and would start a new holding period for such shares.
The U.S. federal income tax consequences to MDLY's stockholders as a result of the MDLY Merger is complex. MDLY stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to them as a result of the MDLY Merger.
