Operating History
We are a Maryland corporation formed in March 2003 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements since 2003. We were initially formed as Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc. and on March 8, 2012, we changed our name to Retail Properties of America, Inc.
Business Objectives and Strategies
In 2018, we completed our portfolio transformation and are now a prominent owner of multi-tenant retail properties, many with a mixed-use component, primarily located in the following markets: Dallas, Washington, D.C./Baltimore, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix and Austin. As a result, our portfolio is better focused, and since our inaugural investor day in 2013, we have (i) improved our retail annualized base rent (ABR) by 34% to $19.36 per square foot as of December 31, 2020 from $14.46 per square foot as of March 31, 2013, (ii) increased our concentration in lifestyle and mixed-use properties based on multi-tenant retail ABR by 1,800 basis points to 34% as of December 31, 2020 from 16% as of March 31, 2013, (iii) reduced our top 20 retail tenant concentration of total ABR by 1,070 basis points to 27.2% as of December 31, 2020 from 37.9% as of March 31, 2013, and (iv) reduced our indebtedness by 32% to $1,762,156 as of December 31, 2020

from $2,601,912 as of March 31, 2013. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 88.6% of our multi-tenant retail ABR was generated in the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), as determined by the United States Census Bureau and ranked based on the most recently available population estimates.
We are focused on optimizing our tenancy, asset level configurations and merchandising through accretive leasing activity and mixed-use expansion and redevelopment projects. Our 2020 leasing activity was accretive, as we signed 371 new and renewal leases across 2,166,000 square feet of GLA for a blended comparable re-leasing spread of 3.0%, achieving comparable cash leasing spreads across 1,760,000 square feet of positive 4.0% on signed renewal leases (1,537,000 square feet) and negative (2.8)% on signed new leases (223,000 square feet). This 2020 signed leasing activity represents approximately 10.9% of our portfolio GLA. These signings helped us achieve the following statistics related to leasing, occupancy and ABR as of December 31, 2020:
•retail portfolio occupancy of 91.7%;
•retail portfolio percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced, of 93.1%;
•retail anchor tenant occupancy of 94.7%;
•retail anchor tenant percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced, of 96.2%; and
•retail portfolio ABR per occupied square foot of $19.36.
During 2020, we also achieved average annual contractual rent increases on signed new leases of approximately 175 basis points.
Our active expansion and redevelopment projects consist of approximately $179,000 to $192,000 of expected investment through 2022, equivalent to approximately 6% of the net book value of our investment properties as of December 31, 2020. These predominantly mixed use-focused projects include the redevelopment at Circle East, the expansion projects of Pads G & H at One Loudoun Downtown and site and building reconfiguration at The Shoppes at Quarterfield as well as the vacant pad development at Southlake Town Square. In response to macroeconomic conditions due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we halted plans for vertical construction at our Carillon redevelopment during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and materially reduced the planned scope and spend for the project. As of December 31, 2020, we had completed the current scope of site work preparation at Carillon in anticipation of future vertical development at the site. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we terminated the joint ventures related to the multi-family rental portion and the medical office building portion of the redevelopment at Carillon. Our current portfolio of assets contains numerous additional projects in the longer-term pipeline, including, among others, redevelopment at Carillon, additional pad developments at One Loudoun Downtown, pad developments and expansions at Main Street Promenade and Downtown Crown, and future projects at Merrifield Town Center, Tysons Corner, Southlake Town Square, Lakewood Towne Center and One Loudoun Uptown.
During 2020, we invested $81,408 in our expansion and redevelopment projects. We:
•completed the site and building reconfiguration and placed the grocer space, which represents approximately 37% of the GLA under redevelopment, in service at The Shoppes at Quarterfield; 
•placed the garage portion of Pad G at One Loudoun Downtown in service;
•advanced construction work at the single-tenant pad development at Southlake Town Square; and
•signed four additional leases at the Circle East redevelopment with leading national retailers, bringing the project to 17% leased as of December 31, 2020.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 has caused, and could continue to cause, significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economy, including the retail sector within the U.S., and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in the financial markets. Many U.S. states and cities, including where we own properties and/or have development sites, imposed measures, and continue to impose measures to varying degrees, intended to control the spread of COVID-19, such as instituting “shelter-in-place” rules, limitations on public gatherings and restrictions on certain business operations and/or the types of construction projects that may continue.

result of the pandemic and the measures implemented to mitigate its impact, a number of our tenants were required to temporarily close their stores or modify their operations and, as a result, requested lease concessions. During 2020, we agreed in principle and, in the majority of these circumstances, executed agreements with tenants regarding lease concessions to defer, without an extension of the lease term, $12,321 of previously uncollected base rent charges related to the year ended December 31, 2020 and to address an additional $14,620 of previously uncollected base rent charges related to the year ended December 31, 2020 through abatement, a combination of deferral and abatement or a concession with the extension of the lease term. In addition, during 2020, retail portfolio occupancy declined 350 basis points to 91.7% as of December 31, 2020 and retail portfolio percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced, declined 310 basis points to 93.1% as of December 31, 2020. Relatedly, ABR in our retail operating portfolio decreased 4.5% from $371,135 as of December 31, 2019 to $354,493 as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, all of our properties were open for the benefit of the communities and customers that our tenants serve and approximately 97% of our tenants (based on GLA), or 96% of our tenants (based on ABR), were open. While many U.S. states and cities have eased or lifted such restrictions, some have subsequently reinstated restrictions and others may do so in the future. We have experienced improving rent collection levels since the beginning of the pandemic, collecting 75.8%, 86.8% and 92.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business. Due to numerous uncertainties, it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate impact the pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our tenants, many of which are considered essential businesses, remain open and continue to operate during this time. Based on ABR of leases in effect as of December 31, 2020, essential businesses and office represent approximately 38.7% of our ABR, including 8.6% from grocery/warehouse clubs and 6.8% from office tenants.
Competition
In seeking new investment opportunities, we compete with other real estate investors, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, private equity funds, private individuals, and other real estate companies.
From an operational perspective, we compete with other property owners on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, location, visibility, amenities, convenience, quality and aesthetic value of construction, and tenant mix. These factors combine to largely determine the level of occupancy and rental rates that we are able to achieve at our properties. Because our revenue potential is linked to the success of retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors that our retail tenants experience when trying to attract customers. These factors include other forms of retailing, including e-commerce and direct consumer sales, and general competition from other shopping centers. To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include:
•local consumer demographics;
•long term population growth;
•quality and location of properties;
•asset configuration;
•sales projections and store spacing;
•diversity and perceived quality of retailers within individual shopping centers;
•management and operational expertise of the landlord; and
•rental rates.
Based on these factors, we believe that the size and scope of our property portfolio and operating platform, as well as the overall quality, adjacencies and attractiveness of our individual properties, enable us to compete effectively for retail tenants. We believe that our geographically focused strategy enhances our ability to drive long-term revenue growth by more thoroughly understanding the local market dynamics through scale and market relevancy.

Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have one wholly owned consolidated subsidiary that has jointly elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is taxed on its net income at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. The income tax expense incurred through the TRS has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We intend to remain eligible to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and minimize our U.S. federal income tax obligations; therefore, these requirements will limit our operational flexibility and result in compliance costs, which could impact our earnings and competitive position in comparison to similar companies or other entities that do not seek to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our REIT Status” for more information regarding our tax status and related requirements.
Government Regulation
General
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). In addition to the discussion above regarding our tax status and below regarding the ADA and certain environmental matters, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to allow access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our existing properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur significant capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding compliance with the ADA.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation, remediation, natural resource damages or third party liability. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several.
Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments or similar environmental audits for all of our investment properties. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a written report that identifies existing or potential environmental conditions associated with a particular property. These environmental site assessments generally involve a review of records and visual inspection of the property, but do not include soil sampling or ground water analysis. These environmental site assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding environmental matters.
Table of Contents

Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance coverage inclusive of fire, extended coverage, earthquakes, terrorism and loss of income insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We believe that the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. Terrorism insurance is carried on all properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. The terrorism insurance is subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances, pollutants, contaminants and biological and chemical weapons. Insurance coverage is not provided for losses attributable to riots or certain acts of God.
Human Capital Resources
We believe that our workforce is a critically important asset. As of December 31, 2020, we had 214 employees, none of which were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. Our talented team of individuals and experienced leaders are integral to the success of our Company and to providing value for all of the Company’s stakeholders. In addition, we depend on the efforts and expertise of our senior management team to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to attracting, retaining and maximizing the performance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. We maintain employment policies that comply with federal, state and local labor laws and promote a culture of fairness and respect. These policies set forth our goal to provide equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, gender (including identity or expression), marital status, civil partnership status, sexual orientation, disability, color, nationality, race or ethnic origin or religion or belief.
We have established a 20% diversity target for our board of directors, taking into consideration the experience and skill sets required of the board of directors. Further, during 2020, we initiated a relationship with Jopwell Inc., a diversity, equity and inclusion partner, to support recruiting a diverse and talented team. We also conducted an unconscious bias, respect in the workplace and diversity training to further enhance our cultural behaviors. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 52% of our workforce was female and minorities represented approximately 26% of our team.
Professional Development and Training
We maintain a strong culture of performance management to ensure the long-term success of the Company. We value each team member’s professional development and provide growth opportunities. Our annual performance management process is an interactive process between managers and employees that includes various touchpoints throughout the year.
In 2020, we established a learning management portal for all employees that provides virtual, on-demand training on a variety of subjects. This portal provides all team members with the opportunity to establish individualized training plans to further their professional development. In addition, we invest in our team through various professional development trainings, such as:
•executive coaching and 360° performance reviews;
•Kellogg Executive Education for Female Leaders; and
•new manager training.
Total Rewards Program
Our total rewards program is designed to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward outstanding performance. We provide (i) base salaries, which are eligible for annual merit increases, and (ii) incentive pay at certain levels within the organization, comprised of short-term cash and long-term stock incentives based on Company and individual performance. In addition, we offer a comprehensive benefits package to meet the diverse health needs of our team members.
Table of Contents

Annually, we issue total rewards statements to all team members that highlight employee and Company contributions in participating benefit categories. The total compensation value is reviewed as part of our performance management program and further highlights the investments we continue to make in our team.
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward Company and individual performance and achievements commensurate with our business results and the execution of our strategic objectives. We also believe that our executive compensation program encourages the alignment of management’s interests with those of our stockholders and help us continue to attract, retain and motivate the key employees who are responsible for driving our long-term value creation.
Team Wellness
Team health and wellness programs are key to our employees’ success. Employee well-being comprises four key fundamental pillars to ensure employee needs are met: physical, emotional, social and financial. We provide regular programming for team members to ensure all have access to wellness programs.
Our focus on the well-being of our team members is further demonstrated by our response to COVID-19:
•added work-from-home flexibility and limited the number of team members onsite;
•established physical distancing practices for team members in our office locations;
•implemented temperature screenings for team members and visitors at our corporate office;
•increased cleaning protocols; and
•prohibited non-essential business travel.
