Item 1.       Business
General

EQT Corporation (EQT or the Company) conducts its business through three business segments: EQT Production, EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission. EQT Production is the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachian Basin, based on average daily sales volumes, with 13.5 Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves across approximately 3.6 million gross acres, including approximately 790,000 gross acres in the Marcellus play, as of December 31, 2016. EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission provide gathering, transmission and storage services for the Company’s produced gas, as well as for independent third parties across the Appalachian Basin, through the Company's ownership and control of EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) (NYSE: EQM), a publicly traded limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. 
In 2015, the Company formed EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP) (NYSE: EQGP), a Delaware limited partnership, to own the Company's partnership interests, including the incentive distribution rights (IDRs), in EQM. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned the entire non-economic general partner interest and 239,715,000 common units, which represented a 90.1% limited partner interest, in EQGP. As of December 31, 2016, EQGP's only cash-generating assets were the following EQM partnership interests: 21,811,643 EQM common units, representing a 26.6% limited partner interest in EQM; 1,443,015 EQM general partner units, representing a 1.8% general partner interest in EQM; and all of EQM's IDRs, which entitle EQGP to receive 48.0% of all incremental cash distributed in a quarter after $0.5250 has been distributed in respect of each common unit and general partner unit of EQM for that quarter. The Company is the ultimate parent company of EQGP and EQM. 
Due to the Company's ownership and control of EQGP and EQM, the results of EQGP and EQM are both consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.  The Company records the noncontrolling interests of the public limited partners of EQGP and EQM in its financial statements.
Key Events in 2016

As of September 30, 2016, EQT was the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachian Basin and the fifth largest producer in the United States based on average daily sales volumes. Significant events in 2016 for EQT include:

• | EQT achieved record annual production sales volumes, including a 26% increase in total sales volumes and a 31% increase in Marcellus sales volumes. However, the average realized price decreased 20% to $2.47 per Mcfe in 2016 from $3.09 per Mcfe in 2015.


• | The Company increased its Marcellus acreage position by acquiring approximately 145,500 net Marcellus acres located primarily in northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, including 122,100 net Marcellus acres acquired through the Statoil Acquisition, the Republic Transaction, the Trans Energy Merger and the Pennsylvania Acquisition (as defined in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).


• | EQM began offering service on the Ohio Valley Connector (OVC) on October 1, 2016. This 37-mile pipeline extends EQM's transmission and storage system from northern West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio, at which point it interconnects with the Rockies Express Pipeline. The OVC is certificated to provide approximately 850 BBtu per day of transmission capacity with an aggregate compression of approximately 38,000 horsepower. EQT has entered into a 20-year precedent agreement with EQM for a total of 650 BBtu per day of firm transmission capacity on the OVC.


• | The Company completed two underwritten public common stock offerings, receiving total net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion for 19,550,000 shares.


• | EQM issued 2,949,309 common units through its "At the Market" common unit offering program (the $750 million ATM Program) at an average price per unit of $74.42. EQM received net proceeds of approximately $217.1 million.


• | EQM issued $500 million of 4.125% Senior Notes (4.125% Senior Notes) due 2026 for net proceeds of approximately $491.4 million.

• | Effective October 1, 2016, EQT sold to EQM (i) 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Allegheny Valley Connector, LLC and Rager Mountain Storage Company LLC and (ii) certain gathering assets located in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, for $275 million (collectively, the October 2016 Sale).


• | On December 28, 2016, the Company sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third-parties for $75.0 million, resulting in an $8.0 million gain.

Business Segments
Prior to the October 2016 Sale, the Company reported its results of operations through two business segments: EQT Production and EQT Midstream. EQT Midstream included the Company’s gathering, transmission and storage businesses as well as the Company's marketing operations that were conducted for the benefit of third-parties. Marketing operations for the benefit of EQT Production were reported in the EQT Production segment. These reporting segments reflected the Company's lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the Company evaluated its operating performance through September 30, 2016. Following the October 2016 Sale, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure to align with EQM's operations. These adjustments included transferring to EQT Production (i) the operation of all midstream assets not owned by EQM and (ii) marketing operations conducted for the benefit of third-parties and resulted in changes to the Company's reporting segments effective for this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under the new reporting structure, the EQT Production segment now includes the Company’s production activities, all of the Company's marketing operations and certain non-core midstream operations primarily supporting the Company's production activities. The EQT Gathering segment contains the Company's gathering assets that are included in EQM. The EQT Transmission segment includes the Company's FERC-regulated interstate pipeline and storage operations. The EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission segments are composed entirely of EQM’s operations and no EQM activities are included within the EQT Production segment. Therefore, the financial and operational disclosures related to EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the same as EQM’s disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The segment disclosures and discussions contained within this Report have been recast to reflect the current reporting structure for all periods presented.
EQT Production Business Segment

EQT Production holds 13.5 Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves across approximately 3.6 million gross acres, including approximately 790,000 gross acres in the Marcellus play, as of December 31, 2016. EQT believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completions in the Appalachian Basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology.  EQT Production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves.  EQT’s proved reserves increased 35% in 2016, primarily as a result of acquisitions. The Company’s Marcellus assets constituted approximately 11.2 Tcfe of the Company's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016.
8

The following illustration depicts EQT’s acreage position within the Marcellus play as of December 31, 2016:
As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s proved reserves were as follows:

(Bcfe) | Marcellus | UpperDevonian | | Other | Total
Proved Developed | 4,732 | | 452 | | 1,659 | 6,843 
Proved Undeveloped | 6,468 | | 197 | | — | 6,665 
Total Proved Reserves | 11,200 | | 649 | | 1,659 | 13,508


The Company’s natural gas wells are generally low-risk, having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis.  Assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2016, the remaining reserve life of the Company’s total proved reserves, as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by calendar year 2016 produced volumes, is 17 years.
9

The Company invested approximately $783.0 million on well development during 2016, with total production sales volumes reaching a record high of 759.0 Bcfe, an increase of 26% over the previous year.  Capital spending for EQT Production is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2017 (excluding acquisitions), the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 207 gross wells, including 119 Marcellus wells, 81 Upper Devonian wells and 7 Utica wells. During the past three years, the Company’s number of wells drilled (spud) and related capital expenditures for well development were:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Gross wells spud: | | | | | 
Horizontal Marcellus* | 130 | | | 157 | | | 237
Other | 5 | | | 4 | | | 108
Total | 135 | | | 161 | | | 345
Capital expenditures for well development (in millions):
Horizontal Marcellus* | $ | 686 | | | $ | 1,527 | | $ | 1,456
Other | 97 | | | 143 | | | 261
Total | $ | 783 | | | $ | 1,670 | | $ | 1,717

* Includes Upper Devonian formations.
As a result of the changes to the Company's reporting segments effective for this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the EQT Production segment includes approximately 6,550 miles of gathering lines. The gathering lines, which are not owned by EQM, primarily support the Company's production operations in non-core areas of declining production. The gathering lines also gather gas for adjacent third-party producers in the Huron play. Revenues for these gathering services are included in Pipeline and Net Marketing Services revenues for the EQT Production segment. These revenues, which are expected to decline over time due to declining production in these areas, were approximately $23.4 million in 2016.
The Company optimizes its contractual processing, transportation and storage assets to sell natural gas and NGLs to marketers, utilities and industrial customers within its operational footprint. The Company provides marketing services for the benefit of EQT Production and third-parties and manages approximately 2.1 Bcf per day of third-party contractual pipeline capacity and 685 MMcf per day of firm third-party processing capacity for the benefit of EQT Production. The Company has also committed to 1.29 Bcf per day of firm capacity on the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) and approximately 200 MMcf per day of additional third-party contractual capacity expected to come online in future periods. The Company currently leases 3.7 Bcf of storage-related assets from third parties.
EQT Gathering Business Segment
As of December 31, 2016, EQT Gathering included approximately 300 miles of high pressure gathering lines with approximately 1.8 Bcf of total firm gathering capacity and multiple interconnect points with EQT Transmission's transmission and storage system. EQT Gathering's system also included approximately 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated low pressure gathering lines. 
In the ordinary course of its business, EQT Gathering pursues gathering expansion projects for affiliates and third party producers. EQT Gathering invested approximately $295.3 million on gathering system infrastructure in 2016 and placed 155 MMcf per day of firm gathering capacity into service. EQT Gathering increased gathered volumes by 21% and gathering revenues by 19% in 2016.
In 2017, EQT Gathering will focus on the following gathering expansion projects:

• | Range Resources Header Pipeline Project. EQT Gathering expects to complete this project in the second quarter of 2017, including the installation of approximately 25 miles of pipeline and 32,000 horsepower compression. The pipeline is expected to cost approximately $250 million and provide total firm capacity of 600 MMcf per day, which is fully reserved under a ten-year firm capacity reservation commitment contract. EQT Gathering expects to invest approximately $40 million on the project in 2017. 

10


• | Affiliate Gathering System Expansions. EQT Gathering expects to invest $200 million to $230 million in 2017 on gathering system expansion projects in support of development of EQT Production's Marcellus acreage position. These expansions include installing approximately 30 miles of gathering pipeline and 10,000 horsepower of compression across northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania during 2017.

EQT Transmission Business Segment
As of December 31, 2016, EQT Transmission's transmission and storage system included an approximately 950-mile FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that connects to six interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies. The six interstate pipelines are Texas Eastern, Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC and National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation. The transmission system is supported by 18 associated natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 645 MMcf per day of peak withdrawal capacity, 43 Bcf of working gas capacity and 41 compressor units, with total throughput capacity of approximately 4.3 Bcf per day as of December 31, 2016. 

In the ordinary course of its business, EQT Transmission pursues transmission projects aimed at profitably increasing system capacity. EQT Transmission invested approximately $292.0 million on transmission and storage system infrastructure in 2016. EQT Transmission placed the OVC project in-service in 2016 at an estimated total cost of approximately $365 million, excluding AFUDC, of which $214 million was spent in 2016. EQT Transmission also spent $78 million on other transmission system projects in 2016. These projects increased total throughput capacity by approximately 700 MMcf in 2016, and revenues increased by approximately $40.3 million or 13.5% in 2016.
In 2017, EQT Transmission will focus on the following transmission projects:

• | Mountain Valley Pipeline. The MVP Joint Venture is a joint venture with affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc., WGL Holdings, Inc. and RGC Resources, Inc. EQM is the operator of the MVP and owned a 45.5% interest in the MVP Joint Venture as of December 31, 2016. The 42 inch diameter MVP has a targeted capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day and is estimated to span 300-miles extending from EQT Transmission's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. As currently designed, the MVP is estimated to cost a total of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, with EQM funding its proportionate share through capital contributions made to the joint venture. In 2017, EQM expects to provide capital contributions of $200 million to $500 million to the MVP Joint Venture, primarily in support of materials, land, engineering design, environmental work and construction activities. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms, including a 1.29 Bcf per day firm capacity commitment by EQT, and is currently in negotiation with additional shippers who have expressed interest in the MVP project. The FERC issued the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the project in September 2016 and is currently working to develop the Final Environmental Impact Statement. The pipeline is targeted to be placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018.


• | Transmission Expansion. EQT Transmission plans to invest $60 million to $80 million on transmission expansion projects in 2017, including Equitrans expansion projects and modernization projects on the Allegheny Valley Connector (AVC) facilities. The Equitrans expansion projects are designed to increase deliverable capacity to EQT Transmission's Mobley hub, which is the origin of both the OVC and the MVP. The projects include additional compression, pipeline looping and new header pipelines. In total, the projects are expected to add up to 1.5 Bcf per day of capacity by the end of 2018, consistent with the target MVP in-service date. The AVC modernization projects primarily consist of the replacement of approximately 20 miles of pipeline.

Strategy

EQT’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by profitably developing its undeveloped reserves, and effectively and efficiently utilizing EQM's extensive gathering and transmission assets that are uniquely positioned across the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica Shales while maintaining an industry leading cost structure.
EQT believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completion in the Appalachian Basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology.  Over 90% of the Company’s acreage is held by production or in fee; therefore, EQT Production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multi-well pads, as opposed to being required to drill less-economical wells in order to retain acreage. The use of multi-well pads, in conjunction with a completion technique known as reduced cluster spacing, has the additional benefit of reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the Company’s drilling operations.

EQM's midstream assets span a wide area of the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica Shales in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. This footprint provides a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the Company for continued growth. EQM intends to capitalize on the growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in this region, including the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 
The ongoing efforts of EQGP and EQM are an important support mechanism for EQT’s overall business strategy. Through capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities and attracting additional third-party volumes, EQM is expected to grow profitably and provide an ongoing source of capital to the Company.
See “Capital Resources and Liquidity” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding the Company’s capital expenditures.

Markets and Customers

Natural Gas Sales:  The Company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers, utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian Basin and the Northeastern United States. The Company’s current transportation portfolio also enables the Company to reach markets along the Gulf Coast and Midwestern portions of the United States. Natural gas is a commodity and therefore the Company typically receives market-based pricing. The market price for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continues to be lower relative to the price at Henry Hub, Louisiana (the location for pricing NYMEX natural gas futures) as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the Northeast region. In order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices, the Company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production, most of which is hedged at NYMEX natural gas prices. The Company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth under the heading “Commodity Risk Management” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” and in Notes 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas. In mid-2011, EQT opened a public-access natural gas fueling station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As a result of growing demand for compressed natural gas for numerous fleets throughout the region, the station added two more dispensers in 2013.  In addition, the Company promotes the use of natural gas with its own fleet vehicles and plans to operate 11% of its light-duty vehicle fleet, more than 110 vehicles, on natural gas by the end of 2017.  All of the Company's contracted drilling rigs and completion crews utilize natural gas.
NGLs Sales:  The Company sells NGLs from its own gas production and from gas marketed for third parties.  In its Appalachian operations, the Company primarily contracts with MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (MarkWest) to process natural gas in order to extract the heavier hydrocarbon stream (consisting predominately of ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline) primarily from EQT Production’s produced gas. The Company also contracts with MarkWest to market NGLs, with the exception of ethane. The Company also has contractual processing arrangements with Williams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC to market NGLs on behalf of the Company in its Appalachian operations. In its Permian Basin operations, the Company sells gas to third-party processors at a weighted average liquids component price. 
14

The following table presents the average sales price on an average per Mcfe basis to EQT Corporation for sales of produced natural gas, NGLs and oil, with and without cash settled derivatives, for the years ended December 31:

 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
Average sales price per Mcfe sold (excluding cash settled derivatives) | $ | 1.99 | | $ | 2.38 | $ | 4.48
Average sales price per Mcfe sold (including cash settled derivatives) | $ | 2.47 | | $ | 3.09 | $ | 4.50


In addition, price information for all products is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under the caption “Consolidated Operational Data,” and incorporated herein by reference.

Natural Gas Gathering: EQT Production accounted for approximately 96% and 91% of EQT Gathering's gathering revenues and volumes, respectively, for 2016.
 EQT Gathering has various firm gas gathering agreements which provide for firm reservation fees in certain high pressure development areas. Including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which EQM had entered into firm gathering agreements, approximately 2.5 Bcf per day of firm gathering capacity was subscribed under firm gathering contracts as of December 31, 2016. The weighted average remaining term of EQT Gathering's firm gathering contracts was approximately 9 years as of December 31, 2016, based on total projected contracted revenues.
On EQT Gathering’s low pressure FERC-regulated gathering system, the primary term of a typical gathering agreement is one year with month-to-month roll over provisions terminable upon at least 30 days notice. The rates for gathering service on the regulated system are based on the maximum posted tariff rate and assessed on actual receipts into the gathering system. EQT Gathering retains a percentage of wellhead natural gas receipts to recover natural gas used to run its compressor stations and for other requirements on all of its gathering systems.

Natural Gas Transmission and Storage: EQT Transmission's customers are affiliates and third-parties primarily in the northeastern United States. In 2016, approximately 73% of transmission volumes and 51% of transmission revenues were from EQT Production. Other customers include local distribution companies, other independent producers and marketers in the Appalachian Basin.
EQT Transmission generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers. EQT Transmission generally provides transmission and storage services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. The fixed monthly fee under a firm contract is referred to as a capacity reservation fee, which is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the contracted volume regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported or stored. In addition to capacity reservation fees, EQT Transmission may also collect usage fees when a firm transmission customer uses the capacity it has reserved under these firm transmission contracts. Where applicable, the usage fees are assessed on the actual volume of natural gas transported on the system. A firm customer is billed an additional usage fee on volumes in excess of firm capacity when the level of natural gas received for delivery from the customer exceeds its reserved capacity. Customers are not assured capacity or service for volumes in excess of firm capacity on the applicable pipeline as these volumes have the same priority as interruptible service.
Under interruptible service contracts, customers pay usage fees based on their actual utilization of assets. Customers that have executed interruptible contracts are not assured capacity or service on the applicable systems. To the extent that physical capacity that is contracted for firm service is not fully utilized or excess capacity that has not been contracted for service exists, the system can allocate such capacity to interruptible services.
Including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which EQM has entered into firm contracts, approximately 4.7 Bcf per day of transmission capacity and 31.3 Bcf of storage capacity, respectively, were subscribed under firm transmission and storage contracts as of December 31, 2016. EQT Transmission's firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2016 based on total projected contracted revenues.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately 92% of EQT Transmission's contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff. The remaining 8% of EQT Transmission’s contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed at the recourse rates under its tariff, which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff.
15

EQT Transmission has an acreage dedication from EQT pursuant to which EQT Transmission has the right to elect to transport on its transmission and storage system all natural gas produced from wells drilled by EQT under an area covering approximately 60,000 acres in Allegheny, Washington and Greene counties in Pennsylvania and Wetzel, Marion, Taylor, Tyler, Doddridge, Harrison and Lewis counties in West Virginia. EQT has a significant natural gas drilling program in these areas.

Natural Gas Marketing: EQT Energy, LLC (EQT Energy), EQT's indirect wholly owned marketing subsidiary, provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of EQT Production and third-parties. EQT Energy also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of EQT Production, the objective of which is to limit the Company’s exposure to shifts in market prices. EQT Energy leases third-party storage capacity in order to take advantage of seasonal spreads, where available.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of EQT's total operating revenues for 2016. One customer within the EQT Production segment accounted for approximately 10% and 12% of EQT's total operating revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company believes that the loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the Company's natural gas are available.
Competition

Natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production, transportation and sale of natural gas and NGLs and the securing of services, labor and equipment required to conduct operations. Competitors include independent oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators.  Competition for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates, customer commitment levels, timing, performance, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, reputation and fuel efficiencies.  Key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines. Key competitors for gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. EQT competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and NGLs. Some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end-users.
Regulation

Regulation of the Company’s Operations

EQT Production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including regulations related to the location of wells; the method of drilling, well construction, well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing and casing design; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations; surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes; and the gathering of production in certain circumstances.  These regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing EQT Production’s natural gas resources.

EQT Production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units; setbacks; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells; drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures; and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties. Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and, for Utica or other deep wells, West Virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration. In West Virginia, the Company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for Marcellus and Upper Devonian acreage. In 2013, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation, which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases, and Texas permits similar joint development. In addition, state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and Texas sets production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well.

The Company's gathering and transmission operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances, including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements; erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects; waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations; various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices; compliance with safety regulations; and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations and transmission facilities. These regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of, and the time to develop, new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations.

16

The Company's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC, and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the FERC. For instance, the FERC approves tariffs that establish EQM’s rates, cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service applicable to its FERC-regulated assets. The fees or rates established under EQM’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers, including a reasonable return on invested capital. The FERC’s authority over transmission operations also extends to: storage and related services; certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities; extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities; maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates; terms and conditions of service; depreciation and amortization policies; acquisition and disposition of facilities; the safety of pipelines; and initiation and discontinuation of services.
In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivative market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), required the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the CFTC had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants, including the Company, such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations.  Other CFTC rules that may be relevant to the Company have yet to be finalized.  Because significant CFTC rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage, it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the Company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations.  The Company has experienced increased, and expects additional, compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment.

Regulators periodically review or audit the Company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  The Company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  Additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the U.S. Congress, the states, regulatory agencies and the courts. The Company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the Company.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation

The business operations of the Company are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the release, emission or discharge of materials into the environment; the generation, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of materials (including solid and hazardous wastes); the safety of employees and the general public; pollution; site remediation; and preservation or protection of human health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. The Company must take into account environmental, health and safety regulations in, among other things, planning, designing, constructing, operating and abandoning wells, pipelines and related facilities.

The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures.  Ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements, have not been material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations. It is customary in the Company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in formations underground where water, sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation. These deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers. The Company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers.  To assess water sources near our drilling locations, the Company conducts baseline and, as appropriate, post-drilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2,500 feet of the Company's drilling pads.  Legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing. If passed into law, the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the Company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells.
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters. 

Climate Change

Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that

limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the Company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the Company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or purchase emission allowances. Climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities, or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements. Conversely, legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the Company by increasing demand for natural gas, because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per Btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels, such as coal. The effect on the Company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.
