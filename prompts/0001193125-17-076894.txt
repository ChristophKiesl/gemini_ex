Overview 
 Rapid7 is a leading provider of analytics for security and IT operations that enable organizations to implement an active, analytics-driven approach to cyber security and IT operations. Our data and analytics platform was purpose-built for todays increasingly complex and chaotic IT environment. We make it simple to collect and unify operational data from across the entire IT infrastructure, and our advanced analytics unlock the information required to securely operate, manage and develop todays sophisticated applications and services. 
 We combine our extensive experience in collecting disparate data, deep insight into attacker behaviors and techniques and our purpose-driven analytics to make sense of the wealth of data available to organizations about their IT environments and users. Our powerful and proprietary analytics enable organizations to contextualize and prioritize the threats facing their physical, virtual and cloud assets, including those posed by the behaviors of their users. Leveraging our IT data and analytics platform, our solutions enable organizations to strategically and dynamically manage their cyber security exposure and manage IT operations. Our solutions empower organizations to prevent attacks by providing visibility into vulnerabilities, and allows them to rapidly detect compromises, respond to breaches and correct the underlying causes of attacks. By providing a unified IT and security platform, with automated workflow, we enable IT and security to work together more effectively to develop, operate and secure their environment. For example, our platform and proprietary technologies were developed to help customers identify the weaknesses and exposures in their environment and are designed to enable them to detect and respond to breaches immediately. We help them troubleshoot performance issues across their IT infrastructure, applications and endpoints. Our platform approach enables organizations to collect data once and use it for ongoing unlimited use and access to solve the specific problems their organization faces, reducing the costs and overhead associated with relying on point solutions, and enabling workflow between organizations that must work together to resolve issues, reduce risk and increase resiliency. 
 We offer analytic solutions across three core areas. Our Threat Exposure Management offerings include our industry-leading vulnerability management, web application security testing and attack simulation products, which we enhance with deep security analytics capabilities to quickly deliver contextual risk prioritization, critical threat awareness and impactful remediation guidance. Similarly, we added analytics and automation to traditional manual penetration testing to be able to deliver robust ongoing attack simulation solutions that provide organizations with visibility into real world threats. By providing and combining analytics, actionable insights and automated workflows related to both an organizations attack surface and the dynamic threat landscape, our data and analytics platform enables organizations to manage their threat exposure above and beyond traditional vulnerability management products on the market. All of our products are designed with an intuitive user interface, focused on ease-of-use and fast time-to-value for our customers. 
 Further leveraging our data collection, analytics and attacker knowledge, we introduced our Incident Detection and Response solutions to provide organizations with the ability to rapidly detect and respond to cyber security incidents and breaches. We believe that the traditional approach to detecting and responding to incidents using Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, Intrusion Detection System, or IDS, and Intrusion Prevention System, or IPS, technologies, among others, is not entirely effective. These technologies can burden an organization with unmanageable volumes of alerts and false positives. Our solutions use advanced analytics to help identify cyber threats to an organization and provide IT security teams with the ability to easily build incident timelines for faster investigations and more efficient resolution, as well as enabling search across the 
 
2 
 
 organizations data from our Insight Platform. Proprietary behavioral and pattern-recognition analytics are central to this capability, which functions in part by automatically mapping an organizations assets and users relative to the threat landscape, such that aberrant and risky user-specific and asset-specific behaviors are rapidly identified, escalated for investigation and prioritized by threat level. To complement our incident detection product, we offer a range of services. These include our recently introduced Managed Detection and Response (formerly known as Analytic Response) service, which provides our customers with a managed service for threat detection and response, and our incident response professional services through which we provide critical access to our security experts and experience to organizations that have identified a serious security incident, enabling them to accelerate incident response and containment. We also offer Security Advisory Services that help organizations develop a holistic approach to their cyber security programs, test their incident response preparedness and advance their cyber security program maturity. 
 Cyber security and infrastructure reliability have become a strategic imperative for organizations globally, driven by increased focus by boards of directors and senior management in the wake of numerous high profile breaches, data thefts and publicly visible IT outages. Three converging macro drivers are changing the cyber security landscape for organizations and driving the increase in cyber breaches. First, mobile and connected devices, cloud-based applications and more open and interconnected networks have increased IT complexity, expanding the exploitable attack surface across an organization and increasing the opportunities for system failure. Second, there has been a dramatic change in the tools available to cyber attackers. Attackers can now purchase, at very low cost, highly effective and easy-to-use software that is designed to circumvent traditional prevention-based tools, thereby lowering the bar for nearly anyone to launch advanced cyber attacks. Third, the economic motives for attackers are more compelling, with new, vibrant markets providing attackers an efficient and effective way to monetize stolen customer information and employee data. 
 The confluence of these factors has dramatically increased the need for IT and security staff to work together to prevent both cyber attacks and system failures, and to drive insight and automation from data. These factors also render the old model of block and protect prevention-based cyber security programs ineffective. These traditional block and protect approaches to cyber security typically rely disproportionately on network perimeter protection tools such as firewalls and antivirus software to stop attackers. However, as the network perimeter rapidly disappears, the effectiveness of these legacy solutions diminishes greatly. Prevention-centric models are often passive and implemented with a deploy and forget mentality, lacking a holistic cyber security and IT risk strategy. While these approaches can alert IT professionals to potentially suspicious activity or potential problems throughout the IT environment, the data generated is often raw and in machine form, and rarely comprehensive, making it difficult for an organization to develop actionable insights that reflect a real-time understanding of the organizations assets, user behavior and the dynamic threat landscape that it faces. Developing these insights has historically been complex and resource intensive, requiring security expertise, data scientists and analytical modeling skills, which many organizations lack. The decreasing effectiveness of a traditional prevention-focused approach to IT and cyber security is causing a significant shift to a new model that uses an active, analytics-driven approach to reduce and manage risks to the organization. This new model disrupts the historical focus on block and protect solutions and balances organizations investments in prevention, detection and correction to reduce the likelihood of, and risks associated with, cyber attacks and system failures. Effective implementation of this new model demands data and analytics to assess the effectiveness of tools and programs, identify anomalous behaviors and prioritize and remediate exposures. We empower organizations to more securely and productively develop and manage their dynamic IT environments by providing the security data and analytics that are at the core of a holistic and active, analytics-driven approach to IT risk management. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 6,200 customers, including 38% of the organizations in the Fortune 1000. We have experienced strong revenue growth with revenue increasing from $46.0 million in 2012 to $157.4 million in 2016, representing a 36% compound annual growth rate. We have strong visibility to our revenue as 55% of the revenue recognized in 2016 was recorded on our balance sheet as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2015 and 86% of the revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 was recorded on our 
 
3 
 
 balance sheet as deferred revenue as of September 30, 2016. We incurred net losses of $49.0 million, $49.9 million and $32.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as we continued to invest for long-term growth. 
 Recent Developments 
 In November 2016, we announced the beta launch of InsightOps, a new IT operations solution designed to centralize machine data across organizations infrastructures. This solution is designed to provide IT teams with comprehensive operational awareness by pairing endpoint visibility and log analytics. With InsightOps, we believe that IT professionals will have the ability to easily search and ask questions of their data to gain insights regarding core issues related to their IT environments faster, which, we believe, will ultimately improve uptime and business productivity. InsightOps is currently being tested in a beta program, and we anticipate it will be ready for sale during the first half of 2017. 
 In November 2016, we announced the appointment of Jeff Kalowski as our new Chief Financial Officer, effective January 9, 2017. He replaced Steven Gatoff, who joined us at the beginning of 2013, announced his planned departure in August 2016 and formally transitioned from our company in January 2017. 
 In October 2016, we announced that Andrew Burton, who was formerly our senior vice president of Logentries, was promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer.

Our Insight Platform provides robust data collection capabilities across multiple data sources, from endpoint information, to user behaviors, to cloud activity. As an organizations infrastructure evolves and expands, additional data sources are quickly and efficiently integrated into our platform. Further, our Insight Platform uses flexible collection methods including a lightweight, easy to deploy endpoint agent that provides instant endpoint visibility to support vulnerability management, security incident detection and IT operations. This allows our platform to amass data from multiple sources quickly and without significant customer installation expertise, while providing greater visibility to IT security professionals. We believe that the simplicity of integrating our products into a customers IT environment is a key competitive differentiator for us, as it provides a significant advantage for IT security professionals who may otherwise be unable to collect and process the necessary data from across their organization. 
 Customer and Use-case Specific Analytics. We understand that developing, managing and securing a modern IT infrastructure requires a combination of role specific analytics and automated workflow to enable success, and the ability to identify and adapt to the risks specific to each of our customers organizations. Our technology platform collects and organizes data from each customers unique IT environment, which allows us to systematically and automatically profile the key risks specific to each customer. By utilizing our powerful, proprietary analytics to assess and understand the context and relationships around users, IT assets and cyber threats within a customers environment, we can provide our customers with specific, actionable insights specific to their environments.

Deep IT and Security Domain Expertise Across Technology, Operations and People. We leverage our deep domain expertise in IT and security analytics to better serve our customers, who frequently have limited ability to carry deep expertise in-house. We offer Security Advisory Services to help customers assess the quality of their security programs and implement changes to make them more effective and cost efficient. We also offer Incident Detection and Response services to help customers find and respond to attacks and compromises that they may be missing on their own. Ultimately, we serve as a trusted security advisor to our customers, encompassing a powerful combination of technology, services and operations expertise to support our customers success in managing their cyber security exposure. We believe that this differentiates our offerings, resulting in strong customer retention and our ability to expand our share of our customers security spending over time. 
 User Behavior Analytics. We believe that our user-centric approach to analytics is a key differentiator of our technology platform and offerings. Our software solutions automatically create a behavior profile for each user in a customers IT environment and automatically correlates every event and device with the correct user. Without this automated correlation, security and IT professionals must search through several technology systems to manually find and connect the information. In addition to saving precious time when things go wrong, our user behavior analytics vastly improve the efficacy of our security incident detection. We compare user profiles against dynamic attacker behavior profiles to distinguish normal user behavior from suspicious behavior and incorporate additional data about how systems are likely to respond when under real-world attack. Within our technology platform, our prioritization engine triangulates on the most important data to determine potentially compromised user credentials and reduce false signals and alerts. In addition, our ability to provide rapid context around users and assets involved in an incident can significantly reduce investigation time, enabling organizations to more quickly respond to, contain and mitigate breaches. These powerful user-centric analytics allow IT security professionals to make informed and proactive decisions. 
 Fast and Accessible Search Capabilities. We believe that our ability to enable fast search through an organizations data and endpoints can enable IT security professionals to better investigate and operationalize data to quickly identify the root cause of issues. Our solutions allow IT security professionals to collect both structured and unstructured machine data and to obtain rapid access to their data. These capabilities, along with real time and easily accessible search across raw logs and endpoints for known patterns with intuitive search queries, can enable IT security professionals to access their data for operational purposes. 
Our Growth Strategy 
 Our mission is to deliver insight from todays broken IT data ecosystem with simple yet powerful solutions that make IT and security teams smarter, more secure and more productive. Key elements of our growth strategy include: 
 Drive New Customer Additions. We believe that most organizations with IT infrastructure would benefit from our products and services, regardless of size or industry, and we have a significant opportunity to increase our penetration across these organizations. In particular, we are focused on further penetrating large enterprises and middle-market businesses. We have principally sold our products and services through our direct inside sales team and address the Fortune 1000 customer with a direct field sales team. We intend to continue to invest in building our global sales and go-to-market organizations. See Our Customers for additional information regarding our markets. 
 Increase Customer Economics and Success. Our customer base includes more than 6,200 customers, as of December 31, 2016. We believe that these customers provide us with a significant opportunity to drive incremental sales by both selling larger volumes of the offerings that a customer is already purchasing from us and cross selling other offerings from our portfolio to these customers. For example, customers acquired in 2012 have spent, in the aggregate, 3.1 times their initial 2012 spend with us through 2016, which we believe reflects both our strong renewal rates and our ability to drive upsells and cross-sells. We believe that we currently only capture a percentage of the total cyber security budgets of our enterprise customers and we believe that they will 
 
11 
 
 increase their spending with us as they continue to shift their programs to security data and analytics-centric strategies. We have a dedicated customer success team focused on engagement and education to drive customer loyalty and increased purchases of our solutions. 
 Continue to Expand Internationally. In 2016, we generated 14% of our revenue from customers outside of North America. We believe that cyber attacks are increasingly global in nature and that organizations globally are increasingly shifting to an active, data and analytics-driven approach to cyber security. We plan to continue to increase our international sales, service and support organizations to target additional sales across Europe and Asia and will also continue to expand our number of channel partners internationally. 
 Continue to Innovate with Our Products and Technology Platform. We plan to build upon our current performance and technology leadership in security data and analytics to enhance our technology platform and product capabilities, and to add new products to address the needs of IT operations staff. For example, in early 2016 we announced InsightIDR, our comprehensive Incident Detection and Response solution that can enable organizations to go from compromise to containment quickly and can also meet their operational compliance needs. This new solution integrates our recently acquired Logentries machine data search technology. InsightIDR builds on our Insight Platform, and our deep understanding of attacker behavior, to provide organizations with actionable insights into security incidents. In late 2016, we announced the beta launch of InsightOps, which also integrates Logentries machine data search technology with the Insight Platform, to provide IT teams with comprehensive operational awareness by pairing endpoint visibility and log analytics. With InsightOps, we believe that IT professionals will have the ability to easily and quickly search and ask questions of their data to gain insight regarding cores issues, faster. 
 Serve as the Hub for IT and Security Analytics Our robust and comprehensive data collection capabilities, deep understanding of the attacker, analytics and workflow-driven approach and leadership within the industry position us to fundamentally change the way that organizations approach cyber security and IT operations. Moreover, our technology platform was developed with open application program interfaces, or APIs, to allow other developers to access the data that we collect and the powerful analytics that we provide. We expect to continue to offer new analytics-based solutions for both IT and cyber security operations and that third-party application developers will continue to leverage our data collection and analytics capabilities. 
 Our Customers 
 Our customer base has grown from approximately 2,260 customers at the end of 2012 to more than 6,200 customers as of December 31, 2016, in 117 countries, including 38% of the organizations in the Fortune 1000. We define a customer as any entity that has 1) an active Rapid7 contract or a contract that expired within 90 days or less of the applicable measurement date; and for Logentries products, those customers with a contract value equal to or greater than $2,400 per year, and 2) purchased Rapid7 professional services within the 12 months preceding the applicable measurement date. We provide products and services to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and government agencies. 57% of our revenue in 2016 was generated by large enterprises, which we define as organizations that have either annual revenue greater than $1.0 billion or more than 2,500 employees, and the balance was generated by middle-market businesses. Our customers span a wide variety of industries including technology, energy, financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, education, real estate, transportation, government and professional services, with customers in the finance industry representing our largest industry in 2016 at 15% of our revenue. Our revenue is not concentrated with any individual customer or group of customers, and no customer represented more than 2% of our revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014. 
Rapid7s Community 
 Our online community provides us with a rapidly growing network of active users and influencers who promote the usage of our software, identify cyber risks and provide technical support to each other. Our community includes paid customers of our software, users of free community trial editions of our software, security 
 
12 
 
 researchers, and users and contributors to our open source Metasploit Framework, which is used to simulate attacks and test an organizations defenses against real-world threats. 
 Our Metasploit project has an active community of contributors and users and the penetration testing tool was downloaded over 160,000 times in 2016. This online security community provides us with a robust and rapidly growing network of active users and influencers who promote the usage of our software. Security researchers contribute modules to the Metasploit Framework that serve as a resource about real-world attacker techniques. The community also provides us with near real-time visibility into new cyber attacks as they occur and a deep understanding of attacker behaviors. 
 We are also an established leader in security research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities. In recognition of this leadership through well-coordinated vulnerability disclosures to vendors and consumers alike, we were recently designated as one of the first companies to be named a third-party Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority by The MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit organization that works in the public interest. In addition, through Project Sonar, we are providing actionable insight into the behavior of global adversaries plus critical information on the exposures and weaknesses of key internet services, based on weekly internet-wide active scans and daily passive activity monitoring via a large-scale network of highly customized honeypots. The intelligence gathered through these research projects is infused in all of our products and services, with certain excerpts provided to the broader research community through the University of Michigan, our academic research partner. 
 Technology Alliance Partnerships 
 Our IT and security analytics platform has the ability to leverage a broad partner ecosystem with over 80 technology platform integrations as of December 31, 2016. We allow other developers to access the data that we collect and the powerful analytics that we provide. We also built our platform with the ability to leverage APIs and data collection from other technologies. This allows us to integrate with other IT and security technologies that our customers may already have in place in three primary ways. 

 | Data Collaboration. Our data collaboration integrations provide two-way data sharing to enhance our platform value. For example, we can ingest data from an existing SIEM technology and also share our analysis of user behavior activity with the SIEM technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Data Workflow. Our data workflow integrations enable IT security integration to streamline the process of correction and improve efficiencies. For example, we make remediation data from our platform available to IT ticketing systems in order to drive operational efficiencies and tracking of IT performance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Data Ingestion. Our data ingestion integrations enhance our analytical capabilities by funneling increased volumes of data to our platform. For example, we ingest firewall data into our platform, which allows us to better understand user activity in the context of attacks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that these integrations with our technology alliance partners enhance the value of our platform to our customers. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing organizations collaborate to create brand preference, efficiently and effectively generate leads, build a strong sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships to help drive revenue growth. Our go-to-market strategy consists of a strong thought-leadership program, digital marketing engine and a diversified sales organization designed to efficiently sell to organizations of all sizes. 
 Sales 
 We sell our products and services through direct inside and field sales team and indirect channel partner relationships. Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling 
 
13 
 
 additional offerings to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia Pacific, or APAC, as well as by target organization size. Our inside sales team focuses on small and middle-market transactions, while larger or more complex transactions are generally handled by our globally distributed direct field sales teams. Our highly technical sales engineers help define customer use cases, manage solution evaluations and train channel partners. 
 We maintain a global channel partner network that complements our sales organization. Our channel partner network expands our geographic sales reach by providing language support and broader distribution capabilities, particularly in EMEA, APAC and Latin America. Our channel partners also provide us with additional leverage by assisting in closing customer transactions as part of larger security purchases, sourcing new prospects and securing maintenance renewals. Our sales force works directly with, and is involved in sales to, substantially all of the end customers of our channel partners, and we sometimes engage a channel partner solely to assist with finalizing a purchase, for example, in the event a customer is working on broader software initiatives with that channel partner. 
 We intend to continue investing in our international sales organization to continue to drive market penetration. We also have a dedicated sales teams focused on government and education customers, which covers U.S. federal, state and local government, as well as educational entities. 
 Marketing 
 We focus our marketing efforts on increasing the strength of the Rapid7 brand, communicating product advantages and business benefits, generating leads for our sales force and channel partners and driving product adoption. We deliver targeted content to demonstrate our thought leadership in security and use digital advertising methods to drive downloads of our free community and trial software, which deliver opportunities to our sales organization. We engage with existing customers to provide community-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our software within these customers. We work with our own researchers, as well as the broader IT and security community, to share important information about vulnerabilities and threats. We share that research through our active online community, social media and traditional public relations. In addition, we host regional and national events to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training and foster community collaboration. 
 Sales and marketing expense totaled $90.5 million, $67.4 million and $49.0 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Research and Development 
 We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our core technology platform and products, develop new end market-specific solutions and applications, and conduct product and quality assurance testing. Our technical and engineering team monitors and tests our products on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing products. We also have a team of experienced security researchers who work to keep us abreast of the latest developments in the cyber security landscape. Our research and development teams are distributed globally and are located in our offices in Cambridge, Austin, Los Angeles, Toronto, Dublin and Belfast providing us with a broad, worldwide reach to engineering talent. Research and development expense totaled $48.0 million, $38.7 million and $25.6 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Our Competition 
 The market for cyber security solutions is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with an array of established and emerging security software and services vendors. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. Our competitors include: vulnerability management and assessment vendors, including Qualys and Tenable Network Security; diversified security software and services vendors, including IBM and HP; 
 
14 
 
 compliance and monitoring solutions such as SIEM, including those provided by LogRhythm, Alienvault, and Sumo Logic; machine data analysis tools such as Splunk; security services specialists, including Mandiant (a subsidiary of FireEye); and providers of point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions. 
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including: 
 

 | product functionality;
--+-----------------------


 | breadth of offerings;
--+----------------------


 | performance;
--+-------------


 | brand name, reputation and customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | ease of implementation, use and maintenance;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | total cost of ownership; and
--+-----------------------------


 | scalability, reliability and security.
--+---------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned to lead with our focus on data analytics products and professional services. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and other contractual protections to protect our intellectual property in the United States and other jurisdictions. 
 We have multiple issued patents and a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and have a number of applications pending in the United States. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
 We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solution. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. 
 We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
