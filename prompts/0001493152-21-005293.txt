Item 1. Description of Business
Organization
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 27, 2014, with fiscal year end on December 31, under the original name Tech Foundry Ventures, Inc. On July 6, 2016, we changed our name to Nevada Canyon Gold Corp. On April 28, 2016, we split our common stock on a 10:1 basis without affecting the par value. On August 27, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a 1:10 reverse split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), which became effective upon approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), which was received on October 28, 2020. All shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to account for the Reverse Stock Split.
 
We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
We were a consulting service company, which provided management and consulting services to early and middle stage start-ups. We were engaged by our first client in June 2015. In December 2015, we changed our business to mineral exploration, when we acquired Nevada Canyon Gold Corporation, a privately held Nevada corporation.
 
Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 316 California Avenue, Suite 543, Reno, NV 89509 and our telephone number is (888) 909-5548, fax is (888) 909-1033 and email contact is info@nevadacanyongold.com. Our website address is www.nevadacanyongold.com.
 
Continued Uncertainty due to Global Outbreak of COVID-19
 
In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of COVID-19 Global pandemic. The COVID-19 has impacted vast array of businesses through the restrictions put in place by most governments internationally, including the USA federal government as well as provincial and municipal governments, regarding travel, business operations and isolation/quarantine orders. At this time, it is unknown to what extent the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may have on the Company as this will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and that cannot be predicted with confidence. These uncertainties arise from the inability to predict the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, and the duration of the outbreak, including the duration of travel restrictions, business closures or disruptions, and quarantine/isolation measures that are currently, or may be put, in place world-wide to fight the virus. While the extent of the impact is unknown, the COVID-19 outbreak may hinder the Company’s ability to raise financing for exploration or operating costs due to uncertain capital markets, supply chain disruptions, increased government regulations and other unanticipated factors, all of which may also negatively impact the Company’s business and financial condition.
 
Business
 
As of the date of this Annual report on Form 10-K, our mineral interests are represented by Lazy Claims Property and Loman Property.
 
Lazy Claims Property
 
On August 2, 2017, we entered into an exploration lease agreement (the “Lazy Claims Agreement”) with Tarsis Resources US Inc. (“Tarsis”), a Nevada corporation, to lease rights to three Lazy claims totaling 60 acres (the “Lazy Claims”). The term of the Lazy Claims Agreement is ten years and is subject to extension for an additional two consecutive 10-year terms. Full consideration of the Lazy Claims Agreement consists of the following: an initial cash payment of $1,000 to Tarsis, which we paid upon the execution of the Lazy Claims Agreement, with $2,000 payable to Tarsis on each subsequent anniversary of the effective date. We agreed to pay Tarsis a 2% production royalty (the “Lazy Claims Royalty”) based on the gross returns from the production and sale of minerals from the Lazy Claims Property. Should the Lazy Claims Royalty payments to Tarsis be in excess of $2,000 per year, we will not be required to pay a $2,000 annual minimum payment. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we retain our leasing rights to the Lazy Claims.

Location and means of access
 
The Lazy Claims consist of three claims (60 acres) and are located within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60-mile-wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada. The Project is located in Mineral County, Nevada, with year-round access and established infrastructure, 18 miles southeast of Hawthorne, NV via U.S. Highway 95.
 
Geology
 
The US Geological Survey has mapped the area and has published the results as Miscellaneous Field Studies maps, MF 1485 and MF 1486. Mapped units include Paleozoic metasediments, Mesozoic sediments and intrusions, and Cenozoic volcanic rocks and porphyry intrusions. Like most of the Walker Lane, the area has a strong system of N50W- trending, normal and strike-slip faults along with a series of generally NE-trending thrust faults. The area has seen prospecting since the late 1800’s and contains hundreds of prospect pits and adits that explore various styles of base and precious metal mineralization.
 
The published USGS geologic quadrangle map for the Pamlico mine area, (MF 1485, MF 1486, Oldow, 1985), shows the eastern portion of the Lazy Claims project area underlain by a thick, undivided sequence of folded and faulted Mesozoic and or Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The western portion of the project is underlain by Jurassic- to Triassic-age Sunrise and Gabbs Formations comprising interbedded limestones and calcareous mudstones. Locally, black Tertiary basalt caps the older rocks. The structural fabric is dominated by NW-trending, Walker Lane structures and by an older N70o E fabric, several phases of strongly altered and locally mineralized intrusive rocks as well as zones of jasperoids and strong silicification has been identified.
 
Mineralization
 
Previous work on the project has identified the following discrete zones of mineralization: (1) the Lazy Man gold zone which is a structurally-controlled, intrusion-related gold deposit that produced about 1,200 oz Au from NW-trending, high grade zones partially hosted by altered rhyolite dikes, (2) areas of strong vuggy silica alteration in both intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates particularly in the footwall of the Lazy Man zone, (3) a large area of barite and copper mineralization with intense bleaching east of the gold zone, (4) strong copper showings to the southeast of the gold zone, (5) the Loman antimony mine to the southwest of the gold zone, (6) skarn zones to the west of the gold zone, (7) a large zone of strong IP response to the west of the gold zone, and (8) a pyrrhotite porphyry intrusion west of the gold zone.
 
Exploration history
 
The Lazy Claims cover several past-producing small-scale high-grade mines, altered and mineralized zones discovered by geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings, discovered by the previous exploration on the Project. The previous sampling on the project has revealed the presence of copper, bismuth, and antimony as well as pervasive lower grade gold mineralization, cut by vein structures (some previously mined) of higher grade gold. Previous induced polarization surveys also denoted the presence of significant coincident I.P. anomalies. Below is a summary of previous exploration of identified mineralized areas within the properties.
 
Lazy Man Mine
 
The main structure that the mine workings explore has an N35oW trend and dips about 60o to the southwest. The vein was discovered in 1933 by a local prospector. The mine is credited with historic production of about 1,200 ounces of gold from 2,800 feet (853 m) of underground workings. The three main shafts explore about 1,000 feet (304 m) of strike length on the vein, and the shafts extend to a maximum depth of 300 feet (91 m). The workings have been mapped and sampled in some detail by Congdon and Carey in 1974, and many multi-ounce gold values are noted in the remaining vein material. One 4.9 foot-long (1.5 m) sample from a cross cut on the 300 level contained 2.2 oz Au/ton (68.4g/t). The high-grade veins occur within a broader zone of intense quartz-sericite alteration, which has previously been mapped as rhyolite. Most of the mine dumps are composed of this “rhyolite”, and Congdon and Carey measured approximately 8,000 tons of this material containing from 0.09 to 0.21 oz Au/ton (3.07 to 7.1 g/t Au). Gold occurs in iron oxide-filled fractures along with druzy quartz veinlets, and there is occasionally visible gold. Detailed mapping around the old workings of the Lazy Man mine has delineated a zone of intense acid-leaching in intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates primarily in the footwall of the vein. The rock now has a porous and vuggy appearance; this style of alteration is interpreted to be “Vuggy Silica” alteration that is typical of the upper levels of high-sulfidation ore deposits. Surrounding the vuggy silica zone is a zone of strong argillic alteration. Recent work has discovered previously unrecognized mineralized zones east of and parallel to the Lazy Man vein that contain silicified, brecciated outcrops assaying 2.26 g/t Au and 8,150 ppm As. These zones have been traced for over 1,200 feet (365 m) and are up to 60 feet (18 m) wide.

Exploration program
 
We plan to continue our exploration program once the uncertainty and the restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic are resolved In 2020 we completed a portion of the Phase I exploration program on the Lazy Claims Property, which consisted of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, and relocating historical workings. Completion of the Phase I program is scheduled for spring of 2021. Once completed, Phase I program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the Phase II drill program. The Phase II drill program is expected to begin later in 2021, following the completion of a ground-based geophysical survey and final compilation of all the Phase I results.
 
Loman Property
 
In December 2019 we acquired 27 unpatented mining claims for a total of $10,395 from a third-party (the “Loman Property”). As at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Loman Property claims are yet to be re-registered into the Company’s name, as due to COVID-19 pandemic certain regulatory requirements cannot be finalized. The Company intends to finalize the re-registration once the current world health crisis has passed and all local regulatory services are operating at full capacity.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Loman Property is located in Mineral County, Nevada, within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60-mile-wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada, located 20 miles southeast of Hawthorne, Nevada, along U.S. Highway 95. The project has excellent year-round access and infrastructure within Mineral County, one of the most pro-mining counties in the pro-mining states and highest-grade gold districts of Nevada.
 
The Loman Property consists of 27 unpatented mining claims having a combined area of approximately 540 acres. The Loman Property covers several past producing small-scale high-grade gold and copper mines, altered and mineralized zones discovered by previous geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings. Historical sampling on the project has revealed the presence of copper, bismuth, and antimony as well as pervasive lower grade gold mineralization, cut by vein structures (some previously mined) of higher-grade gold. Previous geophysical surveys also denoted the presence of significant coincident I.P. and magnetic anomalies. These factors clearly demonstrate the potential of this relatively unexplored project for the discovery of gold mineralization.
 
The Loman Property is located near several past producing mines including the Bodie, Aurora, Borealis, Pamlico, Evening Star, Mabel, Mindoro and Camp Douglas Mines. Held by private interests for most of its history, the Loman Property remains very underexplored with a potential for new discoveries on several exploration targets with multiple zones.

Competition
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters, and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.
Raw Materials
 
The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries, and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.
Dependence on Customers
 
As a junior exploration company, we have no customers.
 
Trademarks and Patents
 
We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks and, other than the obligations under the exploration lease agreement with Tarsis Resources US Inc., no royalty agreements or labor contracts.
Need for Any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
Our exploration activities on our claims may require permits from the BLM and several other governmental agencies. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration of our exploration claims will be adversely affected. Furthermore, the mining business is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.
 
None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit, however, we must ensure timely repair of any damage done to the land during exploration.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations on the Lazy Claims Property and on the Loman Property.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not spent any money on research and development activities.
