--------+---------

Overview
 
Value Statement
 
  Forian Inc. (“Forian”) provides innovative software solutions, proprietary data and predictive analytics to optimize the operational, clinical and financial performance of our customers. Given our prior experience, our initial focus is on stakeholders within the healthcare and cannabis industries. However, we believe the application of our offerings across other verticals to enhance the transparency and efficacy 
of our customers’ relationships with their communities and customers is equally compelling.


Evolution
 
     Forian was initially founded on October 15, 2020, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Medical Outcomes Research Analytics, LLC (“MOR”), which was founded in May 6, 2019, in connection with the business combination 
transactions described below. On October 16, 2020, Forian entered into a definitive agreement with Helix Technologies, Inc. (“Helix”) and MOR, pursuant to which
 DNA Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Forian 
(“Merger Sub”), merged with and into Helix, with Helix surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Forian (the “merger”). On March 2, 2021, Forian entered into a definitive agreement with the equity holders of MOR, pursuant to which the equity holders of MOR contributed their interests in MOR to Forian in exchange for shares of Forian common stock (the “contribution”
 and together with the merger, the “business combination”). Following consummation of the 
business combination on March 2, 2021, Forian became the parent company of both Helix and MOR. On March 3, 2021, Forian’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “FORA.” For further discussion on the 
business combination refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Note 
15 – Subsequent Events” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


“Forian” in this Annual Report
 
 MOR was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger. As a result, the historical financial statements of MOR for periods prior to the merger are considered to be the historical financial statements of Forian. As used in this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” 
each refer to 
Forian except with respect to disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to (i) results of operations or financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and for the comparable period from the incorporation of MOR on May 6, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data”); (ii) controls and procedures (see “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures”) and (iii) executive compensation (see “Item 11. Executive Compensation”), where such references shall refer only to MOR. Each reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to MOR or Helix shall refer to such entity as a standalone business prior to the completion of the business combination and as subsidiaries of Forian after completion of the business combination. We will separately file our pro forma financial statements and Helix audited financial statements for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020 on Form 8-K/A before May 13, 2021. Unless specified otherwise, the financial results in this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K are those of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.


 Our principal executive offices are located at 41 University Drive, Suite 400, Newtown, Pennsylvania 18940 and our primary website address is www.forian.com. The reference to the Forian website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained at or available through our website.


Our Business
 
 Forian is a leading provider of software and technology-enabled services for the healthcare and cannabis industries. Forian represents the unique convergence of proprietary 
healthcare and consumer data, innovative data management capabilities and intelligent data science with a leading cannabis technology platform yielding the combined power to drive innovation and transparency across the industries we serve. Forian’s business today comprises the combination of Helix and MOR, which businesses are described in this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K and when fully integrated present a suite of differentiated offerings within each of the healthcare and cannabis segments. In MOR, there was early recognition of the opportunity to bring the sophistication of proven data science technology and analytics solutions to a prominent cannabis technology platform provider, creating innovation in both the applications that are key to supporting customer success within the cannabis segment and to the data science powered insights that drive healthcare and other mature regulated growth industries. In Helix, there was realization that the capability set of a technology solutions provider within more evolved sectors together with the track record of the MOR management team offered a unique opportunity to enhance the value that Helix brings to its cannabis customers and to the industry generally. The product and service lines provided by both MOR and Helix are being integrated under the single Forian platform.

Our Markets
 
Healthcare Market Opportunity
 
 U.S. healthcare 
spending is roughly 18% of GDP and growing faster than overall GDP. The market has been expanding and evolving rapidly over the past decade due to an aging population, innovations in treatments and a reimagining of service delivery. There has been a growing emphasis on digitizing medical records and providing access to those records to providers and patients in support of more efficient and effective care. Disparate, unconnected systems, new diagnostics and treatment protocols are all generating new sources of data. In addition, data is being generated from retailers, social media and the internet. Collectively, the expansion of the volume and type of data has created challenges in making information interoperable and actionable. New and existing sources of data are often unstructured, preventing the seamless ability to derive valuable insights. New systems and solutions are needed to provide accessible and statistically significant data sets that offer the ability to conduct longitudinal analyses. The derived information and business intelligence is relevant to all healthcare stakeholders, and we believe there is an increasing need for the aggregation and integration of the large clinical data sets, irrespective of the source (e.g. traditional healthcare systems or emerging technologies).


 The global market for healthcare analytics was approximately $19 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow to an estimated $50.5 billion by 2024 
according to publicly available research. We view this market in three principal segments: clinical analytics, commercial analytics and technology platform solutions. The market for clinical analytics includes 
Real World Evidence (“RWE
”), health economics and outcomes research databases and analytic platforms as well as clinical data capture, clinical analytics and research services
, investigator site and patient recruitment, observation studies and pharmacoeconomics. The market for commercial analytics includes customer segmentation and targeting, campaign measurement, longitudinal patient analytics and payer market access analytics. The market for technology platform solutions includes information technology, data management, data warehousing, IT outsourcing and software development.


 We believe that RWE continues to drive value for all healthcare stakeholders. The proliferation of information technology and analytics extends well beyond 
life sciences. Information is critical to the ability for payers to manage and price risk effectively. The emergence of new data assets and technology have enabled better risk stratification, treatment protocol development and decision making relating to coverage of existing and emerging therapies. The ability to enter into value-based contracts is predicated on access to RWE related data and analytics.


 Similarly, the healthcare delivery system is changing rapidly with telehealth and remote based monitoring become critical. As such, providers require more information to inform treatment decisions. This requires connectivity and access to their 
patients’ information including the use of 
over-the-counter (“OTC
”) and unapproved pharmaceutical treatments. Absent standards and the ability to capture and integrate these data into their medical records, they will lack the information required to guide the most effective treatments.


Institutional healthcare providers are losing large numbers of patients and large amounts of revenue due to changes in where and how healthcare is delivered, reduced demand for elective procedures due to COVID-19 and intense competition for customers and referrals. Provider profiling data, market supply and demand analytics and treatment protocol improvements all require information that Forian is well suited to deliver.
 
Life science companies need to fully understand how, when and why patients are treated with both traditional and alternative therapies. This understanding is incomplete without extending the understanding of the patient journey to emerging therapeutics including cannabis-based treatments.

Cannabis Market Opportunity
 
The global legal cannabis market was valued at approximately $20 billion in 
2020 and is expected to grow to an estimated $73.6 billion by 2027 according to publicly available research. The market for our full suite of critical infrastructure services encompasses all licensed cannabis operators in locations where medical or recreational cannabis has been legalized. As more states and countries begin the legalization process, new markets continue to emerge resulting in what we expect to be a natural expansion of our global reach. We 
believe that the next logical step in the expansion of the market may involve federal legalization in the U.S. 
The discourse 
around this topic has been prominent in the current political conversations in Washington D.C. and several measures have already been passed lowering the threshold of federal government regulation on the industry. If legalization does occur at the federal level, this will in turn create an opportunity for the U.S. market to expand globally in much the same way it has domestically, but with the added benefits of both interstate and international trade.
 
As with any emerging market, several companies within the industry achieve a higher level of success faster and are able to scale more rapidly than others. In the cannabis space, a handful of companies hold licenses and operate throughout multiple legal markets and are referred to as Multi-State Operators (“MSOs”). Within newly formed markets, MSOs apply for and are granted licenses allowing these companies to penetrate states that are initially rolling out their cannabis legalization plans. Another tactic used by MSOs to drive consolidation in the cannabis space is to purchase active licenses from established businesses or acquire the business itself (in some cases other MSOs). Mergers and acquisitions inside the cannabis industry are commonplace and show no signs of slowing in the near future. Eight of the largest MSOs in the U.S. currently utilize our BioTrack platform, balanced by nearly 300 dispensaries, cultivators, manufacturers and distributors that depend on BioTrack to drive their businesses.
 
 The rapid expansion of the cannabis market is driving the demand for better technologies, information standards and more sophisticated analytics. Competitive pressures have created a market for 
cultivators, manufacturers and dispensaries to rely on data and analytics as a key development and commercialization strategy. Currently, there is little standardization to organize the vast amount of data being generated from traceability and point of sale technologies. For example, product naming conventions are unique in the cannabis industry and can be very different for the same product. There is a need to create a standard product ontology that can be utilized consistently to normalize and standardize disparate data sets to organize and aggregate the data for commercial analysis and RWE studies. Machine learning and artificial intelligence can be applied to complete, standardize and normalize the data, thereby making the data interoperable and useful for analytics.

States continue to generate tax revenue by approving and expanding their cannabis programs. Their desire to expand these programs deliberately and responsibly with patient safety having the highest priority necessitates the ability to track the products from seed to sale and develop robust patient registries to support RWE studies and tracking product utilization and outcomes. These patient registries allow for surveillance tracking and early adverse event tracking, which will become a cornerstone of state cannabis programs.
 
We believe that the need for cannabis customers to maximize productivity and lower costs across their processes from research and development through commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency. Further, we believe our customers are looking for new ways to simplify processes and drive operational efficiencies by using automation, consolidating vendors and adopting new technology options such as hosted and cloud-based applications. This provides opportunities for us to capture and consolidate internal spending by providing lower-cost and variable-cost options that lower customers’ research and development, selling, marketing and administrative costs.
 
 Our platform puts the power of data to use for operators to gain more valued insights into their businesses resulting in the ability to make better informed decisions. Along with creating new products internally, we currently provide infrastructure solutions for multiple MSOs and as a result 
assist their expansion in new and existing markets.


 Convergence of the Healthcare Market and the Cannabis Industry
 
The use of cannabis for medical purposes is gaining momentum worldwide due to recent legalization and emerging research into therapeutic value and efficacy. Medical cannabis is used for the treatment of a growing array of diseases and chronic conditions, including but not limited to pain, inflammation, arthritis, anxiety, depression, epilepsy and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
 
Life science companies need to fully understand how, when and why patients are treated with both traditional and alternative therapies. This understanding is incomplete without extending the understanding of the patient journey to emerging therapeutics including cannabis-based treatments. Governments, manufacturers, cultivators and distributors as well as dispensaries need information on the safety and efficacy of cannabis in both medical and adult use settings. As legalization and usage expands rapidly, providers, patients and caregivers want more assurance of the quality and consistency of the products and insight into therapeutic alternatives for treatment of chronic conditions.

 
Physicians and patients want to more quickly understand the strains, terpene profiles, dosage and frequency that yield the best health outcomes for patients. There is too much reliance today on anecdotal evidence and trial and error in treatment decisions leveraging alternative therapies. There is little to no understanding of the benefit of alternative therapeutic interventions used in place of or concomitantly with traditional therapeutics. The life science industry is currently investing in over 100 clinical trials for cannabis-based products which is indicative of these treatment alternatives becoming 
increasingly mainstream.
 
Forian Offerings
 
Forian’s mission is to provide our clients with the best-in-class critical technology services through a single integrated platform that enables our clients to operate their businesses more safely, efficiently and profitably and to serve their communities and customers more comprehensively.
 
 We have developed a proprietary, integrated Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), compliant repository of longitudinal 
de-identified patient health information in the United States. This database is updated weekly, includes billions of 
de-identified patient events dating back to 2014 and represents the majority of the U.S. population. Our technology processes, normalizes, standardizes and integrates complex and disparate transactional data, such as medical, hospital and pharmacy claims, healthcare payer remittances, electronic medical records, retail point of sale transactions and consumer demographics.

Our Information Products provide insights across the healthcare continuum and provide a more complete patient journey within a diverse health ecosystem. By leveraging HIPAA-compliant processes, proprietary algorithms and technology, we have created a suite of product offerings integrating data from siloed, disparate sources and platforms. We believe these offerings deliver key insights and value to our customers. We have contracted with several third-party data providers to obtain the data that we believe is necessary to provide our information offerings. MOR has entered into a license agreement dated June 30, 2019 with a third-party data provider pursuant to which MOR currently receives a majority of its healthcare data (the “License Agreement”). The License Agreement has an initial term of three years and MOR has the sole right to extend the term of the License Agreement for three successive two-year periods. Pursuant to the License Agreement, MOR is required to pay to the third-party provider fees for the data MOR is provided and for certain data a percentage of the revenue generated by MOR from such data. MOR believes the fees payable are reasonable and are typical of the fees charged by other third-party data providers. In accordance with the License Agreement, the third-party data provider provides MOR with weekly data reports containing prescription data, medical data and electronic medical record data.
 
Services
 
 BioTrack’s seed-to-sale compliance traceability platform is used by 
9 state regulatory agencies 
(including Puerto Rico
) to manage the tracking and tracing of all cannabis products from cultivation to sale. As legalization at the state level in the United States continues, seed-to-sale tracking will be the foundational compliance tool used by governments to regulate the extensive legal cannabis market.
 BioTrack’s State Traceability & Enforcement Monitoring System (“STEMS”) includes all the components needed to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the entire cannabis supply chain while promoting public safety. STEMS includes a full Seed-to-Sale tracking module with integrated plant and product laboratory testing, a licensed business enforcement application and a fully integrated Patient, Caregiver, and Physician Registration application to provide cannabis regulatory agencies with a comprehensive and all-in-one solution for cannabis program management. STEMS is easily scalable and configurable to meet the evolving regulatory requirements necessary to ensure proper program implementation and oversight.  The primary function of a cannabis traceability system is to assist in the prevention of legal cannabis products going to the black market. Since cannabis is not yet legal in all states and countries, the products that are grown and manufactured in the industry are highly desirable in illicit markets. Besides diversion prevention, traceability systems provide lawmakers and regulators with vital information they can use to better understand the trends and tendencies in their market so they in turn can make informed decisions to help both the industry and the state/country.


 Our RWE solutions under development seek to assist customers seeking to understand the safety, efficacy, and therapeutics of traditional and emerging therapies. Our solutions integrate otherwise unconnected and disparate data to enable near real-time surveillance of adverse events and to study the clinical economic and social impacts of various therapeutic alternatives, including those derived from cannabinoids.

Our Technology Platform
 
 Our unique software, data and analytics platform is built upon scalable open source software running in the public cloud. This architecture allows us to capitalize on the security, reliability and scalability of mainstream cloud providers while building uniquely differentiated algorithms and data handling methodologies. Our use of elastic computing allows us to allocate computer clusters on-demand at scale to process terabytes of data in minutes. We are able to answer complex consumer behavior or life sciences questions quickly without having to maintain servers or pay for idle compute resources.
 
 Our event-driven architecture ingests, cleans, anonymizes and transforms hundreds of millions of health, consumer and retail records as available rather than on a fixed schedule. As data updates are observed from disparate sources they are propagated through all pipeline stages, ensuring customers have the latest data in near real time. Through the use of open-source technologies like Apache Spark and Delta Lake, our big data processing pipelines are streamlined and can more easily handle changes in data schema, “data drift”, and the updating and deleting of existing records to support policies such as HIPAA, the California Consumer Privacy Act and General Data Protection Regulation. Capabilities like “time-travel” enabled by Delta Lake storage formats allow for full versioning of all data over time so that we observe a record throughout its entire lifecycle. Our architecture natively supports “schema evolution” allowing for flexibility to bring in new fields of data as they’re available as well as handle backward-compatible changes in data types over time. Forian supports the ingestion of data from and provision to the most common modern data systems.
 
 Our proprietary solutions provide fully de-identified records in isolated clearinghouses using leading technologies paired with statistical certification by industry-vertical experts. Our solutions join records longitudinally over time, as well as across data sources. This allows for superior flexibility for analysis and use case development while maintaining security and mitigating reidentification risk. We deliver data and analytics products that match anonymized person records across multiple medical, consumer and retail events as a service or in common commercially managed data clouds.
 
Competition
 
We face competition in each of the revenue segments in which we operate.
 
 While the healthcare industry includes well-capitalized, experienced competitors, we believe our unique data assets, synergies, intellectual property and experienced leadership offer us competitive advantages. In general, our competitors include a variety of entities such as information and clinical analytics providers like 
ICON plc, information and commercial analytics providers like 
IQVIA and technology and services providers like 
Veeva Systems, Inc. as well as client in-house developed technologies.


 The legal cannabis industry
, though fragmented
, is consolidating. While our cannabis industry offerings have multiple competitors, with some focused solely on government traceability system, such as Metrc, 
LLC, others focused solely on point-of-sale software
, such as Greenbits Inc., and others providing all aspects of commercial software
, such as Akerna, few if any compete with us in 
our ability to address the needs of dispensaries, cultivators, manufacturers, distributors and governments. As the industry continues to grow, and as more geographies legalize cannabis, we expect more competitors will emerge, while some of the smaller ones will likely cease doing business or be acquired.


Government Regulation
 
Privacy & Customer Data
 
 Our information management services relate to the processing of information regarding 
de-identified patient diagnosis and treatment of disease and are, therefore, subject to substantial governmental regulation. In addition, the confidentiality of patient-specific information and the circumstances under which such patient-specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated. Federal, state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession, use and dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information and personal financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation de-identified health or other data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services.


In particular, personal health information is recognized in many countries and regions such as the United States, the European Union, or EU, and several countries in Asia, as a special, sensitive category of personal information, subject to additional mandatory protections. Violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties and criminal prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.
 
Our technology processes, normalizes, standardizes, and integrates complex and disparate transactional data, such as medical, hospital and pharmacy claims data, EMR data, retail point of sale transactions, media impressions and consumer demographic data. We have developed our platform with strict, HIPAA-compliant privacy controls enabling linkages between the transactional data sources while maintaining patient, consumer, and customer privacy. All data are de-identified at the person level, enabling longitudinal, credible, evidence-based assessments relating to product safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes as well as commercial analytics.

Cannabis and Cannabis-derived Products
 
 We do not grow, handle, process or sell cannabis or cannabis-derived products, nor do we ever possess any such material or process any transactions related to the sale of the same. We provide 
technology and information products and services for our clients to understand the safety and efficacy of their products and to provide information on products, consumers and market intelligence. We do not receive any commissions from sales by our customers and our revenue generation is not based on the sales of cannabis products by our customers, but rather we generate revenues through a fee-based subscription revenue model. Neither we nor our information products are directly subject to state or federal government drug regulation.


 Our customers are subject to state and federal law as it relates to cannabis growth, processing, and sale. 
36 U.S. states have legalized cannabis in some form. The federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811, et. seq. (“CSA”)), which does not recognize the difference between medical and recreational use of cannabis. State laws regulating cannabis are in direct conflict with the CSA, which prohibits cannabis use and possession. Although certain states and territories authorize medical or recreational cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, production, distribution, and sales by licensed or registered entities, under federal law, the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, possession, use, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia, unless specifically exempt, is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under the CSA.


While the United States Department of Justice has used prosecutorial discretion to not prioritize enforcement actions against state-legal cannabis businesses that are compliant with state, county, municipal and other local laws and regulations and which do not trigger any other federal enforcement priorities, the Department of Justice reserves the right to enforce federal law and there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce the CSA and related federal laws in the future. Any shift in enforcement priority at the Department of Justice or with the individual United States Attorneys with jurisdiction over our customers, could have a drastic and adverse impact upon our customers and our business.
 
Any violations of federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens or criminal charges, including but not limited to, seizure of assets, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. In the event that any of our operations, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such operations were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends or effect other distributions. Furthermore, while there are no current intentions to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future, in the event that a determination was made that our proceeds from operations (or any future operations) could reasonably be shown to constitute proceeds of crime, we may decide or be required to suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In addition to our proprietary data sets described above, we develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, software and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of legal, technical and administrative safeguards to protect our proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We consider our trademark and related names, marks and logos to be of material importance to our business, and we have registered or applied for registration for certain of these trademarks in the United States and will aggressively seek to protect them. Trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. The technology and other intellectual property rights owned and licensed by us are of importance to our business, although our management believes that our business, as a whole, is not dependent upon any one intellectual property or group of such properties.

Human Capital Resources
 
The foundation of our software, data and analytics solutions is our people, and the level of our success in helping our customers solve problems in the service of their communities and customers is a direct function of our commitment to our employees. We are the sum of the MOR and Helix cultures, and as a result: (i) our employees now have a more comprehensive platform on which to meet our customers’ needs across the industries we serve; (ii) the professional and personal opportunities for their growth have increased; (iii) through collaboration with one another, additional experiences and skill set exposure will be available for them to learn and grow; and (iv) as a combined organization, we have a fresh opportunity to create a diverse and inclusive culture in which we can thrive together. Our intent is to build a first-class organization premised on the importance of our contribution to customer success while remaining ever conscious of our responsibility to our employees and the communities in which we operate.
 
We are committed to equity and fairness in honoring our commitment to our employees. As set forth in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, diversity across gender, race, ethnicity, religion, politics, sexual orientation, age, experience and thought enhances our ability to support our customers, suppliers, partners and employees. In fostering a culture of inclusion, we enable each of us to present our authentic selves in our dealings with the people with whom we interact, and in so doing allow us to be more effective and impactful in the performance of our responsibilities. We embrace the opportunity to enable our customers to better serve their communities and customers and continually seek to improve the value we bring, all while maintaining a critical balance between our employees’ work with colleagues and customers and their lives outside of Forian.
 
 In order to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 
2020, we transitioned to remote work and continue to work with and support our employees as they continue to serve one another and our customers remotely.


 As of December 31, 2020, MOR had 18 full-time employees. As a result of the closing of the business combination transactions, as of March 2, 
2021, we had 
133 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any organized work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.
