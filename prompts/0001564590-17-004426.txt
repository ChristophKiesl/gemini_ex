Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders and diseases.  We are developing Gimoti, an investigational metoclopramide nasal spray for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in women.  Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder afflicting millions of patients worldwide in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious digestive system symptoms and other complications.  Metoclopramide is the only product currently approved in the United States to treat the symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, and is currently available only in oral tablet and injection dose forms.  Gimoti is a novel formulation of this drug, designed to provide systemic delivery of metoclopramide through nasal spray administration.  
 Gastroparesis is a condition of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction.  In patients with gastroparesis, food remains in the stomach for a longer time than normal, leading to a variety of GI symptoms and systemic metabolic complications.  Gastroparesis typically occurs in individuals with diabetes, but is also observed in patients with prior gastric surgery, a preceding infectious illness, pseudo-obstruction, collagen vascular disorders and anorexia nervosa.  In some patients with gastroparesis, no cause 
 1

can be identified, which is referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis. According to the American Motility Society Task Force on Gastroparesis, the prevalence of gastroparesis is estimated to be up to 4% of the United States population.  Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis may include nausea, early satiety, bloating, prolonged fullness, upper abdominal pain, vomiting and retching.  Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying degrees of severity.  
 Patients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience impaired glucose control due to unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may affect the severity of their signs and symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition, esophagitis, and Mallory‑Weiss tears. Gastroparesis adversely affects the lives of patients with the disease, resulting in decreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and the development of anxiety and/or depression.
 We believe nasal spray administration has the potential to provide our target population of female diabetic gastroparesis patients with a preferred treatment option over the tablet formulation for several important reasons: (1) unlike metoclopramide tablets which may have erratic absorption due to gastroparesis itself, Gimoti is designed to bypass the digestive system to allow for more predictable drug absorption, even when patients are vomiting; (2) the absorption of Gimoti occurs across the thin mucosa in the nasal cavity to allow for rapid and predictable drug administration through the nasal route for patients with delayed gastric emptying and during episodes of vomiting; and (3) for gastroparesis patients experiencing nausea, a nasal spray may be better tolerated than an oral medication.  
 We have evaluated Gimoti in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group, dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial in 287 male and female subjects with diabetic gastroparesis where two doses of Gimoti were observed to be effective in improving the most prevalent and clinically relevant symptoms associated with gastroparesis in women while exhibiting a favorable safety profile. Subjects received either Gimoti or placebo four times daily for 28 days.
 In July 2016, we announced results from a Phase 3 clinical trial of Gimoti in female patients with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.  This Phase 3 clinical trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and population pharmacokinetics, or PK, of Gimoti in adult female patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Subjects received either Gimoti or placebo four times daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint was the change in symptoms from the baseline period to Week 4 as measured using a proprietary Patient Reported Outcome, or PRO, instrument. On a daily basis, subjects reported the frequency and severity of their gastroparesis signs and symptoms using a telephone diary.  The subjects’ daily symptom scores were the basis for calculating their weekly scores using the PRO instrument.
 A total of 205 women (mean age 52.7 years, 88% with type 2 diabetes; 79% postmenopausal, 51% using insulin, mean duration of diabetes was 12.9 years and the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.5%) were randomized and 93% completed the study. Other demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. The primary endpoint for the intent to treat, or ITT, population was not statistically significant (p=0.881), however, in exploratory analyses, a statistically significant treatment effect was seen at Weeks 1 to 3 for patients with higher baseline symptom scores (moderate to severe) in the ITT population (n=105) and for all four weeks for the per protocol population. The per protocol population included all randomized subjects who completed the 28-day treatment period, had no protocol violations or major protocol deviations, had at least 75% overall diary compliance (i.e., 21 or more completed diaries) during the treatment period, and had a non-missing weekly mean daily value for the gastroparesis symptoms assessment, or GSA, total score for Week 4.  Five or more daily GSA total scores must be available during a given week for the weekly mean to be non-missing. Statistically significant treatment effects were seen for nausea and upper abdominal pain for all four study weeks. Reports of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in both groups (36% Gimoti and 35% placebo) and most were mild or moderate in severity. There were slightly more reports of nasal irritation in subjects receiving placebo than in subjects receiving Gimoti. These safety results were consistent with findings from previous Gimoti studies that showed the nasal formulation of metoclopramide has a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated by healthy volunteers and patients with diabetic gastroparesis.  
 In September 2016, we announced the completion of a pre-New Drug Application, or NDA, meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss a proposed NDA and to confirm various regulatory, chemistry, manufacturing, and control, or CMC, and non-clinical requirements for our potential NDA submission for Gimoti. At the pre-NDA meeting, the FDA reviewed a portion of our data package being prepared for the NDA submission. Based on the review, discussion, and minutes received, we believe that the available data would be sufficient for submission of those portions of an NDA utilizing the 505(b)(2) pathway, with acceptance of the final NDA subject to the FDA’s review of the complete package.
 In December 2016, we announced the completion of a second pre-NDA meeting with FDA, in which FDA agreed that a comparative exposure PK trial was acceptable as a basis for submission of a Gimoti NDA.  The comparative exposure PK trial will serve as a portion of the full 505(b)(2) data package to include prior efficacy and safety data developed by us and FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets.  We expect to begin and complete the comparative exposure PK trial in the second half of 2017, followed by a potential NDA submission in late 2017 or early 2018.

In February 2017, we announced that we received a letter from the FDA exempting Gimoti from a Human Factors, or HF, Validation study requirement prior to submission of the NDA.  In February 2016, FDA published new guidance entitled “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices,” which requires drug products classified as a drug/device combination, such as Gimoti, undergo evaluation that may require an HF Validation study as described in FDA’s Guidance.
 To comply with this new FDA Guidance, we evaluated the need for an HF Validation study and submitted an HF assessment report to FDA for Gimoti using a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis risk analysis taking into account the intended uses, users, use environments, product-user interface, and associated medical factors.  In their written response, FDA stated we had adequately considered the risks associated with the proposed Gimoti nasal spray and determined that an HF Validation study is not needed at this time.  The favorable FDA response helps reduce potential risks and saves additional resources in the development process, including NDA preparation.
 In 2014, we also completed a thorough ECG (QT/QTc) study and reported positive results in December 2014.  Prolongation of the QT interval may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmias.  Data from the thorough ECG (QT/QTc) trial met the pre-specified primary endpoint, demonstrating that Gimoti, at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, did not prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects.
 We have also conducted a companion clinical trial with Gimoti in male subjects with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis to assess the safety and efficacy of Gimoti in men.  The male companion trial was initiated in May 2014 and the design was the same as the Phase 3 trial in women.  This trial was requested by FDA to confirm the Phase 2b trial results and to capture additional safety data in men.  This trial was not required for submission of the Gimoti NDA for women; however, we expect to include safety data from this trial in the NDA submission. During November 2016, we determined the trial showed futility so that, even if the trial had fully been enrolled, the results would not have differed. As we anticipated at the beginning of the trial, based on the prior Phase 2b data, the results showed no benefit for Gimoti versus placebo in men. The safety results were consistent with findings from previous Gimoti studies that showed the nasal formulation of metoclopramide has a favorable safety profile and is well-tolerated by patients with diabetic gastroparesis.  
 We have no products approved for sale, and we have not generated any revenue from product sales or other arrangements.  We have primarily funded our operations through the sale of our convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, in September 2013, borrowings under our bank loans and the sale of shares of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market.  We have incurred losses in each year since our inception.  Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with advancing Gimoti through development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations.  We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.  We may never become profitable, or if we do, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring basis.
 Business Strategy 
 Our objective is to develop and bring to market products to treat acute and chronic GI motility disorders that are not satisfactorily treated with current therapies and that represent significant market opportunities. Our business strategy is to: 

• | Pursue regulatory approval for Gimoti. We have completed our Phase 3 trial of Gimoti in female subjects suffering from diabetic gastroparesis and are focused on preparing to conduct a comparative exposure PK trial to serve as a basis for submission of an NDA for Gimoti. We expect to begin and complete the comparative exposure PK trial in 2017, followed by a potential NDA submission in late 2017 or early 2018. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek partnerships to accelerate and maximize the potential for Gimoti. As we continue to generate data on Gimoti, we are seeking partnering opportunities with pharmaceutical companies that have established development and sales and marketing capabilities to potentially enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of Gimoti.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore building in-house capabilities to potentially commercialize Gimoti in the United States. As Gimoti progresses through its Phase 3 clinical program, in addition to partnering opportunities, we are evaluating the development of a specialty sales force and marketing capabilities, either internally or externally, to allow us to directly market Gimoti in the United States, if approved by FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore regulatory approval of Gimoti outside the United States. We will initially seek approval of Gimoti in the United States and then will evaluate the market opportunity in other countries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate the development and/or commercialization of other therapies for GI motility disorders. Similar to our initial focus on gastroparesis, we will evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire other product candidates, as well as commercial products, to treat patients suffering from predominantly GI disorders, seeking to identify areas of high unmet medical needs with limited treatment options.

The Gastrointestinal Market
 The health of the GI system has a major effect on an individual’s daily activities and quality of life. A retrospective review published by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimated that in 2004 there were more than 72 million ambulatory care visits with a diagnosis of a GI disorder in the United States alone. The annual cost of these GI disorders in 2004, not including digestive cancers and viral diseases, was estimated to be greater than $114 billion in direct and indirect expenditures, including hospital, physician and nursing services as well as over-the-counter and prescription drugs. 
 In 2004, the total cost of GI prescription drugs in the United States was $12.3 billion, and over half of this cost ($7.7 billion) was associated with drugs prescribed for gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Peptic ulcer disease, hepatitis C, irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, were major contributors to the remaining drug cost. Historically GI product development efforts have focused on indications with the largest patient populations such as GERD, constipation, peptic ulcers and IBS. As a result, limited innovation has occurred in other segments of the GI market, such as upper GI motility disorders, even though these disorders affect several million patients worldwide. Consequently, due to the limited treatment options available for upper GI motility disorders, we believe there is a substantial market opportunity for us to address significant unmet medical needs, initially for diabetic gastroparesis. 
 GI Motility Disorders 
 Motility disorders are one of the most common GI disorders. Motility disorders affect the orderly contractions or relaxation of the GI tract which move contents forward and prevent backwards egress. This is important in the normal movement of food through the GI tract. Motility disorders are sometimes referred to as functional GI disorders to highlight that many abnormalities in stomach function can occur even when anatomic structures appear normal. Functional GI disorders affect the upper and lower GI tract and include gastroparesis, GERD, functional dyspepsia, constipation and IBS. It has been estimated by the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders that one in four people in the United States suffer from functional GI disorders, having signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, decreased appetite, early satiety, swallowing difficulties, heartburn, vomiting and/or incontinence. 
Gastroparesis 
 Gastroparesis is a debilitating, chronic condition that has a significant impact on patients’ lives. It is characterized by slow or delayed gastric emptying and evidence of gastric retention in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Muscular contractions in the stomach, which move food into the intestine, may be too slow, out of rhythm or erratic. The following graph depicts the timing associated with the emptying of solids in patients with diabetic gastroparesis compared to normal individuals: 
 
The stomach is a muscular sac between the esophagus and the small intestine where the digestion of food begins. The stomach makes acids and enzymes referred to as gastric juices which are mixed with food by the churning action of the stomach muscles. Peristalsis is the contraction and relaxation of the stomach muscles to physically breakdown food and propel it forward. The crushed and mixed food is liquefied to form chyme and is pushed through the pyloric canal into the small intestine in a controlled and regulated manner. 
 In gastroparesis, the stomach does not perform these functions normally, causing characteristic flares of signs and symptoms that include nausea, early satiety, prolonged fullness, bloating, upper abdominal pain, vomiting and retching. As a result of these signs and symptoms, patients may limit their food and liquid intake leading to poor nutrition, experience dehydration and electrolyte 
 4

disturbances due to vomiting, and have poor blood glucose control, ultimately requiring hospitalization. If left untreated or not adequately treated, gastroparesis causes significant acute and chronic medical problems, including additional diabetic complications resulting from poor glucose control. 
 Gastroparesis in the Hospital Setting 
 When patients experience a flare of their gastroparesis symptoms that cannot be adequately managed by oral medications, they may be hospitalized for hydration, parenteral nutrition, and correction of abnormal blood glucose or electrolyte levels. In this setting, intravenous metoclopramide is the first line of treatment. Typically, these diabetic patients with severe gastroparesis symptoms remain in the hospital until they are stabilized and able to be effectively treated with oral metoclopramide. These hospitalizations are costly and expose patients to increased risks, including hospital-acquired infections. The number of patients with gastroparesis that require hospitalization due to their disease is growing, according to a study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in 2008. Additionally, the study reported, from 1995 to 2004, total hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of gastroparesis increased 158%. Hospital admissions for patients with gastroparesis as the secondary diagnosis increased 136%. The average length of stay for a patient is approximately six days at an estimated cost of approximately $22,000. Compared to the other four most common upper GI admission diagnoses (GERD, gastric ulcer, gastritis or nonspecific nausea/vomiting), gastroparesis had the longest length of stay and one of the highest total charges per stay. Additionally, the study estimates that costs associated with gastroparesis as the primary or secondary diagnosis for admission exceeded $3.5 billion in 2004. 
 A study of patients in clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between January 2004 and December 2008, published in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, showed that patients with diabetic or post-surgical gastroparesis had significantly more emergency room visits than other gastroparesis groups. The study reinforced the view that gastroparesis constitutes a significant burden for patients and the healthcare system, with more than one-third of patients requiring hospitalization. The number of emergency room visits and annual days of inpatient treatment were comparable to patients with Crohn’s disease. The study indicated that patients received an average of 6.7 prescriptions on admission. Eighty percent of the patients identified in the University of Pittsburgh study were women. 
 Etiology 
 Gastroparesis can be a manifestation of many systemic illnesses, arise as a complication of select surgical procedures, or develop due to unknown causes. Any disease inducing neuromuscular dysfunction of the GI tract can result in gastroparesis, with diabetes being one of the leading known causes. In a 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports, 29% of gastroparesis cases were found in association with diabetes, 13% developed as a complication of surgery and 36% were due to unknown causes. According to the American Motility Society Task Force on Gastroparesis, up to 4% of the U.S. population experiences symptomatic manifestations of gastroparesis. As the incidence of diabetes rises worldwide, the prevalence of gastroparesis is expected to rise correspondingly. 
 The most common identified cause of gastroparesis is diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is unknown, though it is thought to be related in part to neuropathic changes in the vagus nerve and/or the myenteric plexus. Prolonged elevated serum glucose levels are also associated with vagus nerve damage. The vagus nerve controls the movement of food through the digestive tract and when it is damaged, movement of food through the GI tract may be abnormal. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is rapidly rising, with the Centers for Disease Control estimating that one in ten adults currently suffer from the disease. Sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits and a consequent rising prevalence of obesity are expected to cause this number to grow substantially. According to a study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases in July 2010, between 25% and 55% of type 1 and 15% and 30% of type 2 diabetics suffer from symptoms associated with the condition and diabetics are 29% of the total gastroparesis population. 
 A 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports states that approximately 36% of gastroparesis patients suffer from idiopathic gastroparesis. The development of idiopathic gastroparesis is thought to be related to loss of myenteric ganglion cells in the distal large bowel (myenteric hypoganglionosis) and reduction in the interstitial cells of Cajal, which help control contraction of the smooth muscle in the GI tract. 
 Post-surgical gastroparesis is a smaller subset of the total patient pool and accounts for approximately 13% of all cases of the disease, according to a 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports. Post-surgical gastroparesis is often associated with peptic ulcer surgery, bariatric procedures or esophageal procedures and is thought to result from damage/desensitization of the vagus nerve. 
 Prevalence 
 In 2012, the American Diabetes Association estimated that diabetes affects approximately 29.1 million people of all ages in the United States, equating to about 9.3% of the population. Based on prevalence data, the potential gastroparesis patient pool in the United States is approximately 12 to 16 million adults with women making up 82% of this population, according to a 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports. 
 5

There are 2.3 million diabetic patients with moderate or severe gastroparesis symptoms who are seeking treatment in the United States by a health care professional, according to a study presented at the Digestive Disease Week 2013 conference in Orlando, Florida. When patients do receive treatment for gastroparesis, multiple medications are frequently used to address the individual signs and symptoms of gastroparesis. For example, patients may receive anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting and opioids for abdominal pain, which can exacerbate delayed gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis.
 Unmet Needs in Gastroparesis Treatment 
 Market research and physician interviews demonstrate that existing treatment options for diabetic gastroparesis are inadequate and there is a high level of interest in effective outpatient options for managing patients with gastroparesis symptoms. The market is currently served by oral metoclopramide, intravenous metoclopramide, and the oral disintegrating tablet, or ODT, formulation of metoclopramide (Metozolv® ODT), with approximately 4.5 million prescriptions in the United States per year, according to IMS Health. 
 Due to the limited availability of FDA-approved treatments for gastroparesis, physicians may resort to using medications “off-label” in an attempt to address individual symptoms experienced by patients. Off-label therapies are pharmaceuticals prescribed by physicians for an unapproved indication or in an unapproved age group, unapproved dose or unapproved form of administration. Examples of drugs used without FDA approval in gastroparesis include erythromycin and Botox® injected via endoscopic procedure directly into the lower gastric sphincter. Previously-approved drugs, such as cisapride and tegaserod, are no longer commercially available in the United States because of safety concerns. Domperidone has never been approved by FDA but is obtained through certain compounding pharmacies for individual patients under special FDA usage rules.
 Gimoti is a non-oral, promotility and anti-emetic treatment that we believe has the potential to significantly improve the standard of care for female gastroparesis patients. If metoclopramide nasal spray is approved for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis in women, patients and physicians will have access to an outpatient therapy that could be administered and absorbed even when patients are experiencing delayed gastric emptying or nausea and vomiting. 
 Our Solution: Gimoti (Metoclopramide Nasal Spray) 
 We are developing Gimoti, a dopamine antagonist / mixed 5-HT3 antagonist / 5-HT4 agonist with promotility and anti-emetic effects, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in women. Since oral metoclopramide was approved by FDA in 1980, oral and intravenous metoclopramide have been the only products approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis. Gimoti is a novel formulation of metoclopramide offering systemic delivery by nasal spray administration. 
 We are developing the nasal formulation of metoclopramide to provide our targeted patient population with acute or recurrent symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis with a product that can be systemically delivered as an alternative to the oral or intravenous routes of administration. Nasal delivery is possible because the mucosa of the nasal cavity is a single epithelial cell layer which is well‑vascularized and allows metoclopramide molecules to be transferred directly to the systemic circulation. There is no first pass liver metabolism required prior to onset of action. Since gastroparesis is a disease that halts or slows the movement of the contents of the stomach to the small intestine, oral drug administration is often compromised. Unlike the oral tablet formulation of metoclopramide, we believe that Gimoti may be tolerated even when patients are experiencing nausea and vomiting. The nasal formulation may also provide a predictable and consistent means of delivering metoclopramide in patients with delayed gastric emptying and/or frequent vomiting. 
 A nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide could offer an alternative route of administration for female patients with severe symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis receiving the parenteral formulation of metoclopramide. Following hospitalization for intravenous metoclopramide, a nasal spray formulation would also provide a non-oral option for the transition to an outpatient treatment. 
 Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 In July 2016, we announced results from a Phase 3 clinical trial of Gimoti in female patients with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.  This U.S.-based, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and population PK of Gimoti in adult female patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Subjects received either Gimoti or placebo four times daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint was the change in symptoms from the baseline period to Week 4 as measured using a proprietary PRO instrument.  On a daily basis, subjects reported the frequency and severity of their gastroparesis signs and symptoms using a telephone diary. The subjects’ daily symptom scores were the basis for calculating their weekly scores using the PRO instrument.
 A total of 205 women (mean age 52.7 years, 88% with type 2 diabetes; 79% postmenopausal, 51% using insulin, mean duration of diabetes 12.9 years, mean baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5%) were randomized and 93% completed the study.   The primary endpoint for the ITT population was not statistically significant (p=0.881); however, in exploratory analyses, a treatment 
 6

effect was seen at Weeks 1 to 3 for patients with higher baseline symptom scores (moderate to severe) in the ITT population (n=105) and for all four weeks for the per protocol population (see Table 1 below). There were also clinically and statistically significant improvements in nausea and abdominal pain, which are two of the more severe and debilitating symptoms of gastroparesis (see Table 2 below).
 In July 2015, the FDA issued a draft guidance document regarding the clinical evaluation of drugs for the treatment of gastroparesis, in which FDA states that in order to optimize the ability to demonstrate a treatment effect, clinical trials in this indication should enroll patients with higher symptom severity (moderate to severe).  The improvements observed in our exploratory analyses of our Phase 3 study focused on this subset of patients enrolled in the study. At the time this draft guidance was issued, our Phase 3 study, designed to include patients with a range of symptom severity, had been actively enrolling for more than a year. The overall efficacy results were not significant, due in large part to the patients with less severe symptoms who responded to placebo. Importantly, patients with more severe symptoms experienced a statistically-significant treatment effect with Gimoti, consistent with the recommendation in the draft guidance on clinical studies of gastroparesis.
 Reports of treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in both groups (36% Gimoti and 35% placebo) and most were mild or moderate in severity. There were slightly more reports of nasal irritation in subjects receiving placebo than in subjects receiving Gimoti. In particular, there were no adverse events of special interest, such as the central nervous system, or CNS, effects observed (see Table 3 below). 
 These safety results were consistent with findings from previous Gimoti studies that showed the nasal formulation of metoclopramide has a favorable safety profile and is well-tolerated by healthy volunteers and patients with diabetic gastroparesis. There have been no reports of tardive dyskinesia among the 1,311 exposed healthy volunteers and patients over the metoclopramide nasal spray clinical development program.

In December 2016, we announced the completion of a second pre-NDA meeting with FDA.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss efficacy and safety results from the Phase 3 clinical trial and submission strategies for an NDA.  At the pre-NDA meeting, the FDA agreed that a comparative exposure PK trial was acceptable as a basis for submission of a Gimoti NDA. The comparative exposure PK trial will serve as a portion of the full 505(b)(2) data package to include prior efficacy and safety data developed by us and the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for the Listed Drug, Reglan Tablets.  We expect to begin and complete the comparative exposure PK trial in the second half of 2017, followed by a potential NDA submission in of 2017 or early 2018. 
 In the first pre-NDA meeting with FDA held in August 2016, we confirmed various regulatory, CMC, and non‑clinical requirements for our potential NDA submission. In February 2017, we announced that we received a letter from the FDA exempting Gimoti from a HF Validation study requirement prior to submission of the NDA.
 Male Companion Trial
 We also conducted a companion clinical trial with Gimoti in male patients with symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis to assess the safety and efficacy of Gimoti in men. This trial was requested by FDA to confirm the Phase 2b trial results and to capture additional safety data in men. The design of the male study was the same as the study in women and was initiated in April 2014 at sites also enrolling the Phase 3 study in women. Given that diabetic gastroparesis is predominately a female disorder, enrollment was challenging and the trial spontaneously stopped enrolling with 53 randomized male subjects (26 on Gimoti).
 In November 2016, the data from the study were analyzed and futility was demonstrated. Results confirmed that even if the trial had fully enrolled, the results would not have differed. As we anticipated at the beginning of the trial, based on the prior Phase 2b data, the results showed no statistically significant efficacy in men. The safety profile for Gimoti was well-tolerated and the safety profile was comparable to placebo. The male trial is not required for submission of the Gimoti NDA for women; however, we expect to include safety data from this study in the NDA submission.

Phase 2b Clinical Trial
 We have evaluated Gimoti in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group, dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial in 287 subjects (71% female) with diabetic gastroparesis. Subjects in the trial were between the ages of 18 and 75, with a history of diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and diabetic gastroparesis, who had a baseline modified Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary, or mGCSI-DD, of >2 and <4 for the seven days prior to randomization to blinded study drug (Gimoti or placebo). 
 In the pre-specified analysis of the primary endpoint, mean mGCSI-DD total score change from Baseline to Week 4, by gender, there was a benefit demonstrated in female subjects that was clinically and statistically significant (p<0.025) while male subjects demonstrated a high placebo response rate. This improvement in mGCSI-DD was supported by secondary and exploratory measures of efficacy in females across the majority of parameters evaluated. Due to the results in men, the primary objective of statistical significance in the overall population was not achieved (p=0.15). 
 We believe this Phase 2b trial is the largest ever conducted in a diabetic gastroparesis population for any approved metoclopramide dosage forms (oral tablet, orally disintegrating tablet and injection). Previous metoclopramide studies enrolled small numbers of subjects and did not evaluate treatment effects by gender. For example, fewer than 130 gastroparesis subjects were enrolled across all studies included in the NDA for Reglan Tablets, a branded form of metoclopramide currently marketed in the United States by Ani Pharmaceuticals. 
 The results of our Phase 2b trial are consistent with what is known about the gender effects in other GI motility disorders. GI motility and functional GI disorders, including gastroparesis, are more common in females than in males. Also, healthy females generally have slower gastric emptying rates. In a study conducted at Temple University (Parkman, et al), gastric emptying of solid food in normal young women was shown to be slower than in age-matched men, even in the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle when estrogen and progesterone levels are low, and the delay in gastric emptying of solids in women appears to be primarily due to altered distal gastric motor function. One explanation may be that less vigorous antral contractions may contribute to slower breakdown of food particles and thus delay the rate of emptying. 
 Gastrointestinal disorders present differently in males and females and responses to therapy vary by gender. There is general consensus among thought leaders in GI motility that women have a higher prevalence of symptoms, their neural and sensory pathways differ, and hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, play a role. While the Gimoti Phase 2b trial is the first report of a gender- based difference in response to metoclopramide among subjects with diabetic gastroparesis, gender effects have been reported in drug studies for other GI disorders, such as IBS. For example, products such as Lotronex® (alosetron), Zelnorm® (tegaserod) and Amitiza® (lubiprostone) were approved by FDA based on effectiveness in women, but not in men. 
 Phase 2b Trial Design 
 The Phase 2b clinical trial consisted of up to a 23-day screening period and a seven-day washout period, followed by 28 days of treatment with study drug. We evaluated two dosage strengths of Gimoti: 10 mg and 14 mg; as well as placebo. The study drug was administered for the 28-day treatment period as a single nasal spray four times daily, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Subjects recorded the severity of their gastroparesis symptoms in a telephonic diary using an interactive voice response system once each day. The symptoms were analyzed using a patient reported outcomes instrument, the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary, or GCSI-DD, developed for collecting and analyzing data to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for gastroparesis. 
 The GCSI-DD contains nine signs and symptoms (nausea, retching, vomiting, stomach fullness, not able to finish a normal sized meal, feeling excessively full after meal, loss of appetite, bloating, and stomach or belly visibly larger) grouped in three subscales. The daily score is calculated as a mean of three subscale means. Additional signs and symptoms collected in the daily diary included abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, number of hours of nausea, number of episodes of vomiting, and overall severity of gastroparesis symptoms. In close collaboration with the staff of FDA’s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products and the Clinical Outcome Assessments, or COA, these additional symptom data were used to further refine the patient reported outcome instrument.
 The result is the mGCSI-DD comprised of four symptoms (nausea, early satiety, bloating, and upper abdominal pain) rated from zero (none) to five (very severe). The instrument has been optimized to detect symptom variability on a severity continuum from nausea to vomiting. 
 Phase 2b Efficacy Results 
 Two patient reported outcome endpoints (mGCSI-DD and GCSI-DD) were examined in ITT population based on the protocol design and FDA communications: 
  
• | The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from seven-day baseline to Week 4 of the treatment period in the mGCSI-DD total score (mean of four symptoms).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The second efficacy endpoint analyzed was the change from seven-day baseline to Week 4 of the treatment period in the GCSI-DD total score (mean of three subset means with a total of nine symptoms).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although an overall improvement in symptoms was observed in Gimoti-treated subjects with diabetic gastroparesis compared to placebo, the difference was not statistically significant due to a high placebo response among male subjects. However, statistically significant improvement in gastroparesis symptoms was observed in female subjects with diabetic gastroparesis as measured by the mGCSI-DD and GCSI-DD total scores for both doses of Gimoti compared to the placebo. The beneficial effect of treatment in females appears to be uniform. The results are consistent across the overall endpoints, the individual components, and the two dose groups. 
 The observed differences in efficacy were based on gender and were not due to severity of baseline disease or other demographic characteristics. No statistically significant differences were observed in efficacy between the 10 mg and 14 mg Gimoti doses; thus the 10 mg dose was considered the lowest effective dose in this study. The table below summarizes the p-values observed for both doses of Gimoti compared to placebo in the Phase 2b clinical trial across all subjects and for male and female subjects separately.

Phase 2b Safety Observations 
 In the Phase 2b clinical trial, Gimoti 10 mg and 14 mg doses were well-tolerated and no differences in the safety profiles were observed between the two doses administered. No serious adverse events occurred related to study treatment. In addition, there were no clinically-meaningful differences observed in clinical laboratory parameters, physical examination findings, or electrocardiogram recordings. 
 Adverse events that occurred more commonly in both Gimoti 10 mg and 14 mg doses compared to placebo (≥2% difference between treated compared to placebo groups) were dysgeusia, headache, nasal discomfort, rhinorrhea, throat irritation, fatigue, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate and transient in nature.

Phase 1 Comparative Bioavailability Bridging Study
 Our Phase 1 clinical trial of Gimoti was an open-label, four-treatment, four-period, four-sequence crossover study conducted at a single study center. Forty healthy volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of four treatment sequences. After an overnight fast, subjects received a single dose of each of the metoclopramide treatments (10 mg Gimoti, 20 mg Gimoti, 10 mg Reglan tablet, and 5 mg/mL Reglan injection) in random sequence with a seven-day washout period between doses. Thirty nine subjects received at least one dose of metoclopramide. The pharmacokinetic analysis population consisted of 37 subjects who received all four treatments and two subjects who received three of the four treatments. 
 12

After nasal spray administration of the 10 mg and 20 mg doses of Gimoti, mean plasma metoclopramide concentrations increased in a dose-related manner, as did mean values for Cmax and AUCinf. The absolute bioavailability of Gimoti after nasal spray administration was comparable for the 10 mg (47.4%) and 20 mg (52.5%) doses as were the bioavailabilities relative to the oral tablet (60.1% and 66.5%, respectively). 
 The graphs below illustrate the mean plasma concentrations of the active ingredient in the two doses of Gimoti as well as the oral and injection forms. 
 
Thorough ECG (QT/QTc) Study
 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, four-way crossover thorough ECG (QT/QTc) study of Gimoti in 2014. The study was designed in accordance with FDA’s published guidance on clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval, and compared the effects of Gimoti on the QT/QTc interval when administered at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses in 48 healthy female and male volunteers. Moxifloxacin, an antibiotic known to prolong the QT/QTc interval, was used as the positive control. 
 In December 2014 we reported that data from the study met the pre-specified primary endpoint, demonstrating that Gimoti, at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, did not prolong the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects.  The study was conducted to satisfy a safety requirement by FDA in support of our submission of an NDA for Gimoti.
 Prior Development
 From 1985 to present, we, or our predecessors, have conducted numerous clinical studies to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of nasal spray formulations of metoclopramide in healthy volunteers and the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and profile of metoclopramide nasal spray in patients. More than 1,311 subjects have been dosed in these studies with nasal formulations of metoclopramide at doses ranging from 10 mg to 80 mg. 
 In one study, a Phase 2A, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel design study, Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Questcor (now part of Mallinckrodt plc), compared the efficacy and safety of two doses of metoclopramide nasal spray, 10 mg and 20 mg, with FDA-approved 10 mg metoclopramide tablet. For the primary efficacy endpoint in the per protocol population analysis, a statistically significant difference in the total symptom score between baseline and week 6 for both the nasal 10 mg (p=0.026) and nasal 20 mg (p=0.008) cohorts compared to the oral 10 mg group was observed. Metoclopramide nasal spray was initially developed by Nastech Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. in precursor formulations to Gimoti and subsequently acquired and developed by Questcor. 
 We acquired rights to this product candidate from Questcor in 2007. We then optimized the acquired formulation of metoclopramide nasal spray to improve stability and remove inactive ingredients to improve the palatability and tolerability of Gimoti for subjects. We also developed the current formulation with excipients that are at or below the levels listed in FDA’s Inactive Ingredient Database for nasal products. 
 We evaluated the current formulation of Gimoti in five completed clinical trials enrolling a total of 636 patients and healthy volunteers (Phase 1 (39), Phase 2 (190), QT/QTc (54), Phase 3 (205) and Companion (53)) and the nasal spray pump used is the same.
 13

The primary container closure system for Gimoti is comprised of an amber glass vial directly attached to a pre-assembled spray pump unit with a protection cap. Each multi dose sprayer system comes preassembled and capable of delivering a 30 day supply (120 doses at 4 doses per day.) The sprayer is a standardized metered sprayer technology utilized in other nasal spray products as well as the amber vial. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 Overview 
 We are building an intellectual property portfolio for Gimoti in the United States and abroad. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidate, its methods of use and processes for its manufacture, and for other technologies, where appropriate. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies we consider important to our business, defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Patent Portfolio 
 Our patent portfolio currently includes the following patents and applications: 
  
• | U.S. Patent 6,770,262—Nasal Administration of Agents for the Treatment of Gastroparesis. This patent expires in 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. Patent 8,334,281—Nasal Formulations of Metoclopramide. This patent expires in 2030.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Provisional Patent Application No. PCT/US2012/052096—Treatment of Symptoms Associated with Female Gastroparesis. If granted, this patent would expire in 2032.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have also been granted patents in the European Union for the method of use of metoclopramide via nasal delivery for gastroparesis. These patents provide protection through 2021. 
 The United States patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability. A provisional patent application is not examined for patentability, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date. As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into a patent. The requirements for filing a provisional patent application are not as strict as those for filing a non-provisional patent application. Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish an earlier filing date for a subsequent non-provisional patent application. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, or PTA, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. In view of a recent court decision, the USPTO is under greater scrutiny regarding its calculations where the USPTO erred in calculating the patent term adjustment for the patents in question denying the patentee a portion of the patent term to which it was entitled. Alternatively, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. 
 The effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application is used by the USPTO to determine what information is prior art when it considers the patentability of a claimed invention. If certain requirements are satisfied, a non-provisional patent application can claim the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed provisional patent application. As a result, the filing date accorded by the provisional patent application may supersede information that otherwise could preclude the patentability of an invention. 
 Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 We currently have a registered trademarks for EVOKE PHARMA and Gimoti in the United States.

Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. 
 In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed for us. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We plan to commercialize Gimoti in the United States alone, or in partnership with pharmaceutical companies that have established development and sales and marketing capabilities. Our strategy for Gimoti, if approved, will be to establish Gimoti as the prescription product of choice for diabetic gastroparesis in women. If the product candidate is approved, our expectation is that Gimoti would initially be sold to gastrointestinal and internal medicine specialists, primary care physicians and select health care providers. We may also utilize contract sales forces to assist in the marketing of Gimoti to approved patient populations. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of Gimoti, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our clinical trials. 
 In April 2015, we announced the completion of production of a commercial scale lot of Gimoti as required by FDA. With the completion of this large scale production of Gimoti, we believe we have demonstrated our ability to manufacture Gimoti at commercial scale quantities in accordance with CMC. In addition to data from this recent program, we have a three-year registration stability data package from previous studies which have all met proposed specifications. These CMC datasets will be submitted as part of our NDA submission following completion of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial and male companion trial.
 We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Gimoti. We intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of Gimoti prior to regulatory approval. We currently utilize a third-party consultant, which we engage on an as-needed, hourly basis, to manage our manufacturing contractors.  
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, coverage pricing and reimbursement. 
 Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete. 
 We expect that, if approved, Gimoti will compete directly with metoclopramide oral, erythromycin and domperidone as a treatment for gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is the only product currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is available from a number of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers as well in branded form in the United States under the tradename Reglan® Tablets from Ani Pharmaceuticals. 
 Previously, Propulsid® (cisapride) and Zelnorm® (tegaserod) were prescribed off-label by physicians to treat gastroparesis. Propulsid® (cisapride) was approved for use in the treatment of dyspepsia and GERD. Zelnorm® (tegaserod) was approved for use in IBS and idiopathic chronic constipation. Both of these products have been withdrawn from the market because of cardiac safety issues.

Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. launched an orally dissolving tablet formulation of metoclopramide in 2009. Other programs in the gastroparesis pipeline include new chemical entities in earlier-stage clinical trials. In addition to our Gimoti product candidate, we are aware of the following development candidates; all of which are in Phase 2 clinical development. 
 Gastroparesis Treatment Development Pipeline

 RM-131 is a small-peptide analog of ghrelin, a hormone produced in the stomach that stimulates gastrointestinal activity. The compound is being developed for GI motility disorders and has shown efficacy in surgical and opiate-induced ileus in animal models due to a direct prokinetic effect. In October 2016, a Phase 2b study failed to reach statistical significance. Following the trial results, Allergan plc. executed its option to acquire Rhythm Holding Company, LLC.  RM-131 reverses body weight loss in cachexia models. 
 TD-5108, also called Velusetrag, is a 5-HT4 receptor agonist compound under development for the treatment of gastroparesis by Theravance Biopharma, Inc., in collaboration with Alfa Wassermann S.p.A. Previously, TD-5108 was under development for chronic constipation.
 Tradipitant is a NK-1 antagonist that has been tested in various other indications by Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.  No known data related to gastroparesis is available for this program.  
 Renzapride, a 5-HT4 agonist and 5HT-3 antagonist, has been studied in more than 5,000 patients including one Phase 3 trial for the treatment of constipation-dominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). Renzapride demonstrated a small but statistically significant benefit in the Phase 3 study in IBS-C, however, the prior owner of the product decided to not continue to pursue development of the drug for this indication.  The drug was well tolerated and showed no evidence of cardiotoxicity. A pilot Phase 2 study in patients with diabetic gastroparesis showed that doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg, once-daily, showed significant improvement in gastric emptying in a dose-dependent manner.  This endpoint does not meet the July 2015 FDA guidance for gastroparesis recommending measurement of symptoms associated with gastroparesis.
 Altos Therapeutics LLC, or Altos, is developing the ATC-1906 compound as an oral dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist that addresses the symptoms of nausea and vomiting in gastroparesis patients. As part of the agreement, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, will provide Altos an upfront payment for the option to acquire Altos. If Takeda elects to exercise the option, Takeda would make an additional payment to acquire Altos, and would then assume control over development and commercialization of ATC-1906.
 Erythromycin is a motilin receptor agonist and is frequently used off-label in the treatment of gastroparesis. Erythromycin is well known to induce nausea and vomiting across all indications and is particularly associated with exacerbated nausea when used in gastroparesis. Repeated administration of macrolides is also linked to desensitization of the motilin receptor and tachyphylaxis. Extended dosing with antibiotics can lead to the development of resistant organisms as well as pathologic changes in intestinal flora. 
 One additional medication, Motilium (domperidone), a dopamine receptor modulator, is not FDA-approved, but is available in the United States through various compounding pharmacies under a specific FDA restricted-access program. The safety and efficacy of Motilium as a promotility agent is not fully established.

Technology Acquisition Agreement 
 In June 2007, we acquired all worldwide rights, data, patents and other related assets associated with Gimoti from Questcor pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. We paid Questcor $650,000 in the form of an upfront payment and $500,000 in May 2014 as a milestone payment based upon the initiation of the first patient dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial for Gimoti.  In August 2014, Mallinckrodt plc, or Mallinckrodt, acquired Questcor.  As a result of that acquisition, Questcor transferred its rights included in the asset purchase agreement with us to Mallinckrodt.  In addition to the payments we made to Questcor, we may also be required to make additional milestone payments to Mallinckrodt totaling up to $51.5 million. These milestones include up to $4.5 million in payments if Gimoti achieves the following development targets: 

• | $1.5 million upon FDA’s acceptance for review of an NDA for Gimoti; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $3 million upon FDA’s approval of Gimoti.
--+------------------------------------------

 The remaining $47 million in milestone payments depend on Gimoti’s commercial success and will only apply if Gimoti receives regulatory approval. In addition, we will be required to pay to Mallinckrodt a low single digit royalty on net sales of Gimoti. Our obligation to pay such royalties will terminate upon the expiration of the last patent right covering Gimoti, which is expected to occur in 2030. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with FDA current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations, including, for devices and device components, the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to FDA of an NDA;
--+-----------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to FDA. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 
 17

Further, an IRB covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site, and it must monitor the study until completed. FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB’s or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, or FDA or IRB may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the National Institutes of Health-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within ten months of the date of receipt by FDA (for drugs that do not contain new molecular entities) and ten months of the 60-day filing date (for drugs that contain new molecular entities). A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months from the date of receipt by FDA (for drugs that do not contain new molecular entities) and six months of the 60-day filing date (for drugs that contain new molecular entities). However, FDA does not always complete its review within these timelines and the Agency’s review can take substantially longer. 
 We believe that our product candidate will be granted a Standard Review for a product that does not contain a new chemical entity. The review process may be extended to allow FDA to request and review additional information or obtain clarification regarding information provided in the original submission. FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements, including QSR requirements for the device component of the product, and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements before approving an NDA. 
 18

After FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete or that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction, FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Once issued, FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, FDA may suspend, restrict or withdraw the approval, require a product recall, or impose additional restrictions or limitations if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave FDA the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess 
 19

the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. 
 In March 2009, FDA informed drug manufacturers that it will require a REMS for metoclopramide drug products. FDA’s authority to take this action is based on risk management and post market safety provisions within the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act. The REMS consists of a Medication Guide, elements to assure safe use (including an education program for prescribers and materials for prescribers to educate patients), and a timetable for submission of assessments of at least six months, 12 months, and annually after the REMS is approved. In 2011, FDA determined that maintaining the Medication Guide as a part of the approved labeling is adequate to address the public health concern and meets the regulatory standards.  As a result, FDA determined that a REMS for metoclopramide is no longer required.  We intend to follow current labeling procedures to include a medication guide at the time of the NDA submission for Gimoti. 
 FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market, and FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Indeed, FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials are pre-cleared by FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 The distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is also subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs. 
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 As an alternate path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness based on certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on studies conducted for a previously approved drug product, the applicant is required to certify to FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in FDA Orange Book. FDA Orange Book is where patents associated with a FDA-approved product are listed. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The Section 505(b)(2) NDA application also will not be accepted or approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the referenced NDA and patent holders once the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. Under the FFDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the NDA and patent holders’ receipt of a Paragraph IV certification in most cases automatically prevents FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court decision or settlement finding that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is earlier. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30-month stay if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) 
 20

applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. 
 The 505(b)(2) NDA applicant also may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year exclusivity. Specifically, a product may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, FDA would be precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has expired. Additional non-patent exclusivities may also apply. 
 Additionally, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may have relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if so, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against those applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying those applicants. 
 Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA’s cGMP regulations including applicable QSR requirements. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. 
Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our drug candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services 
 21

resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 Additionally, the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on certain drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information, as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
