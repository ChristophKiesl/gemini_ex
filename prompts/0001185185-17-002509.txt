ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2001, and in 2009 changed our name to Sport Endurance, Inc.
 
Mr. David Lelong has been the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer since February 4, 2016 and the Company’s sole director since April 25, 2016.
 
The Company is presently marketing for sale three products in the areas of Total Wellness, Performance, and Recovery.  The products are called Ultra Peak T, Sports Leg & Lung Formula, and Pain-Freeze Recovery Gel.
 
The Company has acquired product inventory from an unaffiliated outside provider (PureSource, Inc.).  The Company is in the process of ramping its direct marketing efforts through online channels and has not yet achieved material revenue in connection with its business to date. As a result, we are a startup company, with a limited operating history or revenue, and are at a competitive disadvantage.
 
The competition for and difficulty in selling our products may affect our ability to develop profitable operations in the future.  Companies that are engaged in selling health supplements include large established companies with substantial capabilities and long earnings records.
 
We have only received insignificant revenues from our operations and are in the process of ramping our sales and marketing operations. Our auditors note that the absence of revenues and operations, in the Audit Report dated November 29, 2017, is a going concern. The going concern statement opinion issued by the independent auditors is the result of a lack of operations and working capital.
 
The Company cannot pay its short-term debt and will need to raise capital which concerned the independent auditors because there is insufficient cash for operations for the next 12 months.  If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we will cease operations. 
 
We established the minimum amount of $200,000 that the Company will need to raise through financing so that sales and marketing operations can proceed in order to generate revenue. Presently no other sources of financing have been identified, and it is unknown if any other sources will be identified. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any financing. The Company owes approximately $536,458 of principal of notes which are due in December 2017.  If the Company cannot repay the notes or obtain a forbearance from the note holders, it will cease operations.
 
The Company has developed marketing plans and materials for reaching prospective customers directly through online advertising. The necessary systems and processes to accept, fulfill, and service customer orders have been implemented and tested. Sales and marketing efforts will ramp up once the Company receives sufficient financing.
