 Our Business
 We are a clinical‑stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody therapeutics to treat severe and life‑threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. We have developed a proprietary XmAb® technology platform that we use to create next‑generation antibody product candidates designed to treat autoimmune and allergic diseases, cancer and other conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches to antibody design, which focus on the portion of antibodies that interact with target antigens, we focus on the portion of the antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. This portion, referred to as the Fc domain, is constant and interchangeable among antibodies. Our engineered Fc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains. 
 We believe our Fc domains enhance antibody performance by, for example, increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half‑life or stabilizing novel antibody structures, while maintaining 99.5% identity in structure and sequence to natural antibodies. By improving over natural antibody function, we believe that our XmAb‑engineered antibodies offer innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantages over other treatments. Our protein engineering capabilities allow us to continually explore opportunities for additional functionality in the Fc region.The most recent expansion of our platform is the XmAb bispecific Fc domains, which enable the rapid design and simplified development of antibodies that bind two or more antigens simultaneously.  Bispecifics are a rapidly emerging area of biotherapeutics development, particularly in immuno-oncology, and we are using our XmAb bispecific Fc domains as a robust scaffold to develop a pipeline of new bispecific oncology candidates that recruit immune cells against tumors.
 We are developing a suite of clinical candidates using two of our Fc technology platforms. We have developed two wholly owned clinical, stage product candidates, using our Immune Inhibitor Fc platform; XmAb5871 is currently in two Phase 2 trials and is being developed for autoimmune disease and XmAb7195 is currently in a Phase 1 trial and is being developed for asthma and allergic diseases.  
 We are also developing a pipeline of bispecific antibody candidates using our heterodimer Fc bispecific technology:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | XmAb13676 is currently in a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of B-cell malignancies,

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | XmAb20717 is in preclinical development for the treatment of various cancers and is our first dual checkpoint inhibitor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These product candidates all use XmAb Fc domains to confer enhanced antibody functionality.

 Our business strategy is based on the plug‑and‑play nature of the XmAb technology, allowing us to create new antibody drug candidates for our internal development or licensing, or to selectively license access to one or more of our XmAb technologies to pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to use in developing their own proprietary antibodies with improved properties.  Our Fc technologies have been used to develop multiple product candidates for us and our partners and we have different levels of involvement in creating and developing these candidates:

· | Compounds we have created, we wholly-own and which we are currently developing,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compounds we have created and are co-developing with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (Novatis) pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compounds that we have created, performed early-stage of development and licensed to our partners for further development and,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compounds that were created by our partners that incorporate one of our Fc technologies for which all development for these compounds is the responsibility of our partner. These transactions usually require limited resources or efforts from us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are currently eleven antibody product candidates in clinical trials that have been engineered with XmAb technology, including seven candidates being advanced by licensees and development partners.
 Our protein engineering capabilities allow us to continue to expand the functionality of the XmAb technology platform to identify new protein enhancements and create new antibody drug candidates with improved properties. The most recent addition to our technology, heterodimer Fc domains, enables the creation of bispecific drug candidates, which are antibodies that are engineered to bind two targets simultaneously. The core of our bispecific programs is a novel Fc domain that is a robust and portable scaffold for two, or potentially more, different antigen binding domains. Our Fc domain technology is designed to maintain full-length antibody properties in a bispecific antibody, potentially enabling stable molecules with favorable in vivo half-life and allowing for the use of standard antibody production methods.  These bispecific Fc domains are being used to rapidly generate a broad array of novel drug candidates for our own pipeline and for our partners. 
 We were founded in 1997 based on protein engineering technology developed by our co-founders Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D. and Stephen Mayo, Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology. We began our first therapeutic monoclonal antibody engineering and discovery programs in 2002 and entered into our first XmAb technology license in 2004. 
 Our Wholly-Owned Compounds
 Our XmAb technology has created a suite of wholly owned compounds that we are developing: two XmAb compounds that are currently in clinical trials and four additional compounds that are at earlier-stage of development by us as well.

XmAb5871 uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and targets B cells, an important component of the immune system. We believe that XmAb5871 has the potential to address a key unmet need in autoimmune therapies due to its combination of potent B-cell inhibition without B-cell depletion. 

In June 2015, we announced results from a Phase 1b/2a  placebo-controlled trial of XmAb5871 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The results indicated that XmAb5871 was generally well tolerated.  Although the trial was not designed to observe a statistically significant difference in efficacy results between XmAb5871 and placebo treated patients, sufficient efficacy trends were seen to warrant continued clinical development of XmAb5871 in autoimmune indications. A numerically increased proportion of patients with improvements across several measurements of disease activity were observed in the XmAb5871 treated groups compared to placebo.   

In the first quarter of 2016 we began enrolling two Phase 2 trials for XmAb5871, one in IgG4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) and another trial in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE or Lupus). We also initiated a Phase 1 trial with a subcutaneous formulation of XmAb5871 in the third quarter of 2016.

IgG4-RD:  we are currently conducting a Phase 2 open-label pilot study of XmAb5871 for IgG4-RD. In early 2017 we enrolled the last of the 15 planned patients.The trial design is for patients to receive every other week IV administration of XmAb5871 for up to 24 weeks and the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of XmAb5871 on disease activity using the recently reported IgG4-RD Responder Index in patients with active IgG4-RD. Secondary objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability profile and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of every other week IV administration of XmAb5871. 

 In November 2016 we presented preliminary data from the trial for 12 patients that had been enrolled and received one or more doses through October 31, 2016, the date selected for cut-off of the interim data review.  The preliminary data indicated that XmAb5871 was well tolerated by patients receiving drug in the study. As of the cut-off date, no serious adverse events were reported. Treatment related AE’s have occurred in five patients (42%), all mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2). One patient discontinued the study as the result of an AE. The patient developed a Grade 2 (moderate) hypersensitivity reaction with rash and arthritis, commonly referred to as serum sickness, following the fifth infusion. The event quickly resolved without the need for medical management. This patient was subsequently found to have developed anti-drug antibodies.

Preliminary efficacy data from the trial was very encouraging. As of the cut-off date, 11 of 12 patients dosed with XmAb5871 had a least one responder index performed followed dosing. Nine of the 11 patients (82%) reviewed under the responder index had an initial response to XmAb5871 therapy of at least a three point reduction in IgG4-RD Responder Index within two weeks of the first dose. The study protocol provided that any reduction in the IgG4-RD Responder Index greater than or equal to two points was considered a positive response for that patient. Five of the nine patients attained disease remission, or an IgG4-RD Responder Index of zero. Two of the nine patients that entered the study on steroids have been able to taper and discontinue their steroid use during the study. 

In addition to the patient with early study termination due to an AE, two other patients have discontinued treatment prior to receipt of all 12 planned infusions. One patient had a response to therapy (IgG4-RD RI reduction of six points), but lost response following the sixth infusion, and one patient had no response to therapy.  Neither of these two patients have responded to subsequent rituximab treatment.

We expect to provide top line data from this trial in the second half of 2017.

We believe that the promising preliminary data from the Phase 2 trial warrants further clinical development of XmAb5871 in treating IgG4-RD and we are planning such development.

In 2016 we also completed enrollment of a bioequivalence trial for XmAb5871 using a subcutaneous formulation and we expect to provide data from this trial in 2017. Our plan is to conduct further clinical studies with XmAb5871 in a subcutaneous formulation.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): in March 2015 we also began enrolling a Phase 2 randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study of XmAb5871in SLE.  This trial is designed to assess the effect of XmAb5871 

 
  5

 
on SLE disease activity in a shorter timeframe and using fewer patients compared to standard SLE trials, and XmAb5871 is the first newly developed agent being assessed with this novel trial design.  The trial design calls for treating patients with moderate to severe, non-organ threatening SLE with XmAb5871 (or placebo) after their lupus disease activity has improved with a short course of intra-muscular (IM) steroid therapy. Background, potentially confounding, immunosuppressant medications will be stopped. In this double-blinded placebo-controlled study, the ability of XmAb5871 to maintain the improvement in disease activity after IM steroid therapy and in the absence of immunosuppressant medication will be assessed. Historically, SLE trial designs generally add new medications to the many already taken by the patient, and hence display a discernible treatment effect only when restricted to the sickest patients.  The trial will enroll approximately 90 subjects, 1:1 randomized to XmAb5871 or placebo, for up to 24 weeks.

XmAb7195 uses our Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and is being developed for the treatment of severe asthma and allergic diseases. XmAb 7195 is designed to reduce blood serum levels of IgE, which mediates allergic responses and allergic disease. 

In May of 2016 we reported complete data results from the Phase 1a trial of XmAb7195.  The Phase 1a study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose trial conducted in three parts:  Part 1, a single IV administration of XmAb7195 or placebo to 40 healthy volunteers in five consecutive dose cohorts; Part 2, 16 otherwise healthy subjects with elevated serum IgE ( > 300 IU/mL) in two consecutive dose cohorts (Part 2); and Part 3, two sequential IV administrations (Day 1 priming dose of 0.3 mg/kg and Day 8 second ascending dose) of XmAb7195 or placebo to 16 healthy subjects in two consecutive dose cohorts. The primary and secondary objectives of the study were to determine the safety and tolerability profile of IV administration of XmAb7195 and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of IV administration of XmAb7195, respectively. Exploratory objectives include the determination of the effect of XmAb7195 on serum free and total IgE and the effect on basophil surface IgE and basophil FcεRI expression levels. 

The data showed rapid reduction in circulating free IgE levels to below the limit of detection ( < 9.59 ng/mL) for 93% of XmAb7195 treated healthy adult subjects in Part 1 that had detectable free IgE pre-dose, including those at the lowest dose evaluated of 0.3 mg/kg, with total IgE reduced in a parallel fashion. Five of six high IgE subjects dosed at 0.6 mg/kg XmAb7195 and nine of 12 subjects across all doses had sustained undetectable free IgE following infusion, with a median pre-dose free IgE of 710 ng/mL (424 - 1777 ng/mL). High IgE subjects treated with XmAb7195 single infusions across all dose levels had profound (mean pre-dose 583.5 IU/mL, mean nadir 7.77 IU/mL) reductions of total IgE, which were sustained for at least a week at ≥1.0 mg/kg doses. 

XmAb7195 as an intravenous (IV) infusion was generally well tolerated in the safety population of 54 subjects. The two most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were thrombocytopenia and urticaria. All but one TEAE was mild or moderate. One serious adverse event of severe bronchospasm was observed during infusion in an atopic subject with a history of perennial and seasonal allergies. The event responded quickly to discontinuation of the infusion and medical intervention. 

The adverse event of thrombocytopenia, which was transient and asymptomatic, was reported in seven out of seven subjects treated with ≥2 mg/kg doses of XmAb7195, and in no subjects treated with < 2 mg/kg. The nadir in platelet count occurred by 24 hours post-infusion and recovery began by 48 hours, with near full recovery by Day 8 in most subjects, at which time serum drug concentrations still exceeded levels that eliminate detectable IgE. Dose-dependent, non-clinically significant, reductions in platelet count were observed in most subjects that received ≥0.75 mg/kg XmAb7195. In Part 3 of the study, decreases in platelet count were seen after the second dose on Day 8 for the 1.0 mg/kg dose level, even for subjects with no detectable free IgE after the Day 1 0.3 mg/kg priming dose, but not seen after the second dose for the 0.3 mg/kg dose level. 

Moderate urticaria was reported in a total of 10 of 54 XmAb7195 treated subjects with an apparent correlation of dose with frequency of occurrence. In all cases regardless of dose, the signs/symptoms of urticaria were mild, non-diffuse and easily treated with oral antihistamine, and the study drug infusions were continued to completion without worsening of symptoms.

In 2016 we initiated a Phase 1 trial for XmAb7195 with a subcutaneous formulation. The first part of the trial is an open-label, parallel group, multi-dose study to establish a safety dose for subcutaneous XmAb7195 in 

 
  6

 
healthy volunteers. The second part of the trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers and atopic subjects with XmAb7195. We expect to announce top line data from this trial in 2017.

XmAb18087 is our first bispecific oncology candidate that targets solid tumors. XmAb18087 binds to somastatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), a target on neuroendocrine tumors, and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells. We expect to file an IND for this compound in 2017.

XmAb20717 is our first bispecific checkpoint inhibitor and targets PD1 and CTLA4 and we expect to enter clinical trials for this compound in 2018.
 Compounds that we are Co-developing with Novartis
 In June 2016 we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the Novartis Agreement) with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (Novartis) to develop and commercialize bispecific and other Fc engineered antibody drug candidates using the Company’s proprietary XmAb® technologies. Pursuant to the Agreement, we granted Novartis certain exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, the Company’s two lead bispecific clinical candidates. Under the Novartis Agreement we granted Novartis a license to commercialize the sale of drug candidates from these two programs in all worldwide territories outside the United States . We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $150 million in July 2016. Assuming successful development and commercialization of a product, we could receive up to $325 million in milestones for each of XmAb14045 and XmAb13676. The total potential milestones for each product include $90 million in development milestones, $110 million in regulatory milestones and $125 million in sales milestones. If commercialized, we are eligible to receive tiered low double-digit royalties on global net sales of approved products outside the United States.
 The Company and Novartis will co-develop XmAb14045 and XmAb13676 worldwide and share development costs equally. The Company may elect to opt-out of the development of either program by providing notice to Novartis. If the Company elects to opt-out with respect to a program, Novartis will receive the Company’s United States rights to the program and the Company will receive low double-digit royalties on United States net sales in addition to the royalties on net sales outside the US.
 Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, the Company will also apply its bispecific technology to up to four target pair antibodies selected by Novartis, if such target pairs are available for exclusive license to Novartis and are not subject to a Xencor internal program.
 Under the Novartis Agreement, the Company is also granting Novartis a non-exclusive research license to  use certain of the Company’s Fc technologies, specifically Cytotoxic, Xtend and Immune Inhibitor Fc domains to research, develop, commercialize and manufacture antibodies against up to ten target selected by Novartis, if such targets are available for non-exclusive license and not subject to a Xencor internal program.
 XmAb14045 uses our XmAb bispecific Fc technology that allows us to create dual-antigen targeting molecules. In September 2016 we began enrolling patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial for XmAb14045 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  XmAb14045 targets CD123, an antigen on AML cells and leukemic stem cells, and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells.  The trial is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity in AML. Initial data from this trial is expected in 2017 pending alignment with Novartis on timing of disclosure.
 XmAb13676 is our second bispecific oncology candidate and we began enrolling ina Phase 1 trial in February 2017.   It targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and is a tumor-targeted antibody that contains both a tumor antigen binding domain (CD20) and a cytotoxic T-cell binding domain (CD3).  The trial is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity in B-cell malignancies.  Initial data from this trial is expected in 2018 pending alignment with Novartis on timing of disclosure.

     Our Out-licensed Compounds
 In addition to our wholly-owned compounds in clinical development and those being co-developed with Novartis, we have used our XmAb technology to create antibody compounds which have been licensed to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for further development.  These licensed compounds do not require additional development effort by us as they advance into development by our partners.  If successful, these candidates will generate additional milestone payments and royalties to support our internal development efforts. These include XmAb5574/MOR208 (now MOR208) licensed to MorphoSys AG (MorphoSys), and XmAb13551, a bispecific CD38 x CD3 preclinical candidate, which we developed and licensed to Amgen Inc. (Amgen).

      MOR208 is an antibody drug candidate originally created by us and developed through a Phase 1 clinical trial.  It incorporates our XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain. Pursuant to a Collaboration and License Agreement (MorphoSys Agreement) with MorphoSys AG (MorphoSys) in June 2010, this compound is being developed by MorphoSys for the treatment of blood‑based cancers. 
 MorphoSys is currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of MOR208 in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MorphoSys has indicated that it has received fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for targeting diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and has announced that they intend to initiate a Phase 3 trial for this indication in 2017.  
 Under the terms of the MorphoSys Agreement, we received a $13 million upfront payment and $3 million for development milestone payments in 2013. If certain developmental, regulatory and sales milestones are achieved, we are also eligible to receive up to an additional $299 million in milestone payments which are comprised as follows: $62.0 million in clinical development milestones, $187 million in regulatory approval milestones and $50 million of aggregate milestone payments for the achievement of certain product sale goals. If licensed products are commercialized, we are also entitled to receive tiered royalties in the high single‑digit to low‑teen percent range.  
 The term of this agreement will continue until all of MorphoSys’ royalty payment obligations have expired unless terminated earlier.    
 XmAb13551 (CD38 x CD3) is a preclinical drug candidate originally created by us and licensed to Amgen in September 2015.  It is being developed for the treatment of multiple myeloma. XmAb13551 incorporates our bispecific XmAb Fc domain and binds both the tumor antigen CD38 and a cytotoxic T-cell domain, CD3. Amgen has assumed all responsibility for further development.
 Amgen licensed the worldwide development rights to XmAb13551 as part of a Research and License Agreement executed in September 2015 (the Amgen Agreement).  We received a $45 million upfront payment and will be eligible to receive up to $355 million in milestone payments for XmAb13551 and tiered high single to low double-digit royalties on global net sales of approved products.  Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, Xencor will also apply its bispecific technology to five specific Amgen provided antibodies (Amgen Discovery Programs).
 Our Out-Licensed Technology
 We selectively license our XmAb technology to other companies for use in their own internal development candidates and to potentially make next-generation improvements to their marketed products.  These licenses generally

require little research effort and no development effort by us and provide us with cash to fund our own research and development programs.  These agreements typically provide the licensee with specific rights to use one or more of our Fc technologies to be applied to their proprietary antibodies or targets. The licensee is generally responsible for all development, of any resulting product candidate. As part of these agreements, we are generally entitled to receive upfront fees, annual licensing fees, potential milestone payments and royalties on the sales of any resulting products. In connection with our collaboration with Novo Nordisk, we also received research and development funding.  
 There are currently eight programs in development with our partners. The most advanced programs are with Alexion which started a  Phase 3 clinical trial in 2016 and CSL-Janssen, which entered into a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2015.

 In January 2016, we announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of VRC01LS, a therapeutic antibody for the treatment of HIV that uses our Xtend antibody half-life extension technology.  VRC01LS is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted to the CD4 binding site of HIV-1. VRC01LS is a modification of the VRC01 monoclonal antibody, which demonstrated a suppression of HIV viral load in a Phase 1 trial conducted by NIH. VRC01LS includes our Xtend technology in order to enhance antibody half-life and stability.  NIH has not entered into an agreement with us for this technology. Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing engineered monoclonal antibodies to treat severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to: 
· | Advance the clinical development of our lead Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain product candidates. We are developing XmAb5871for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including IgG4-RD and SLE, and are developing XmAb7195 for the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases. We are completing a Phase 2 trial for XmAb5871 treating IgG4-RD in 2017 and plan on advancing development of this compound in 2018. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Build a large and diversified portfolio of product candidates. We aim to create new XmAb-engineered antibody product candidates that exploit the novel properties of our XmAb technology platform for preclinical and clinical development by us or, if appropriate, license certain candidates to leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Create a pipeline of bispecific candidates for us to advance into clinical development. Our XmAb bispecific technology allows us an opportunity to rapidly develop multiple antibody drug candidates with dual targeting mechanisms. We have initiated a Phase 1 trial for our first two bispecific oncology candidates, XmAb14045, and XmAb13676. We have four additional candidates at the preclinical stage of development including

XmAb18087, which we plan on filing an IND for in 2017 and initiating clinical trials in 2018 and, XmAb20717, our first bispecific checkpoint inhibitor which will enter the clinic in 2018.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to monetize and expand the use of our XmAb technology platform. We continuously seek opportunities to maximize the value of our XmAb technologies and will selectively license access to certain of the technologies to leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in their proprietary programs. In 2016, we received $150 million upfront in connection with the Novartis Agreement and are eligible to receive up to $2.4 billion in potential milestones. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Broaden the functionality of our XmAb technology platform. We are conducting further research into the function and application of antibody Fc domains in order to expand the scope of our XmAb technology platform. Our bispecific technology, which uses our heterodimeric Fc domain enabling molecules with dual target binding, is an example of the expanding functionality of our XmAb technology platform. We are expanding the functionality of the bispecific platform with the development of a series of dual checkpoint inhibitor clinical candidates beginning with XmAb20717. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to expand our patent portfolio protecting our XmAb technology platform. We seek to expand and protect our development programs and product candidates by filing and prosecuting patents in the United States and other countries.

  Our XmAb Technology Platform
 Our XmAb Fc domain technology is a platform of antibody components that enable the creation of therapeutic antibody candidates that have novel interactions with the human immune and antibody regulation systems. We developed the XmAb technology platform from a systematic effort to engineer the Fc domain of antibodies to manipulate its interactions with a variety of its natural receptors. We used our patented screening technology, consisting of algorithms and computer models of the three-dimensional structure of the Fc domain, to focus on, from the vast number of possibilities, manageable sets of possible amino acid changes that result in small modifications to the Fc domain structure which effect significant changes in antibody function and performance.
 We have identified a set of Fc domains, each of which is engineered to have a specific function based on its Fc receptor binding profile, including:

· | Bispecific Domain – heterodimeric Fc domains enabling molecules with multiple target binding 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain—selective immune inhibition and rapid target clearance, targeting the receptor FcγRIIb
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cytotoxic Fc Domain—increased cytotoxicity, targeting the receptors FcγRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells and FcγRIIa on other immune system cells
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Xtend Fc Domain—extended antibody half‑life, targeting the receptor FcRn on endothelial cells
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, we have engineered XmAb Fc domains with other properties, including rapid antigen clearance, antibody stability and multiple-antigen specificity (heterodimer). Each XmAb Fc domain consists of a naturally occurring Fc domain with a small number of amino acid changes, usually two that we found to be critical for modulating interactions with the desired Fc receptors or manipulating Fc structural organization. With such limited modifications of the natural Fc domain, XmAb‑engineered antibodies are typically over 99.5% identical in structure and sequence to natural antibodies, simplifying product development yet enhancing function. In contrast to other engineering approaches for next-generation antibodies, we believe this conservative design allows our engineered antibodies to retain the beneficial stability, pharmacokinetics, and ease of discovery of natural antibodies, as well as to allow well-validated 

 
  12

 
methods for antibody manufacturing. We believe we can thereby avoid the problems many new antibody platforms have had in production and drug stability.  
 XmAb Bispecific Domain technology
 Bispecific antibodies are designed with two different variable domains to elicit biological effects that require simultaneous binding to two targets.  Previously, industry efforts at bispecific antibody design have generally been frustrated by poor molecular stability, difficulties in production and short in vivo half-life.   Our XmAb® Bispecific Fc Domain technology is designed to maintain full-length antibody properties in a bispecific antibody, potentially enabling stable molecules with favorable in vivo half-life and allowing for the use of standard antibody production methods.  These bispecific Fc domains are used to generate a broad array of novel drug candidates.
 We have created Fc variants that form heterodimeric Fc domains that enable the creation of bispecific antibodies which bind to a different antigen with each of their Fv domains. Our initial bispecific candidate discovery work was to build a pipeline of bispecific antibodies that bind both CD3 and a tumor antigen in order to recruit cytotoxic T cells to the tumor cell. The next focus of our bispecific platform is to develop a series of bispecific checkpoint inhibitors.Because of the Fc domain, these bispecific antibodies retain the long half-life and ease of production typical of standard antibodies.
 The plug-and-play nature of the bispecific platform has allowed us to develop a pipeline of bispecific candidates for ourselves and our partners. In 2015 we entered into the Amgen Agreement in which we licensed a pre-clinical bispecific compound, XmAb13551, and applied our bispecific technology to five identified Amgen antibodies. and we received $45 million upfront and are eligible to receive a total of $1.7 billion in milestone payments. In 2016 we entered into the Novartis Agreement in which we licensed certain rights to our two lead bispecific compounds, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, and are applying our bispecific technology to four Novartis antibodies and we will also license certain other Fc technologies to Novartis. We received a non-refundable upfront payment from Novartis of $150 million and are eligible to receive up to $2.4 billion in milestone payments. 
 We have initiated Phase 1 clinical trials for our first two bispecific candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, and have four additional bispecific candidates in preclinical development.
 XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain technology
 FcγRIIb is an inhibitory receptor that is expressed on B cells and other cells. FcγRIIb, when engaged by Fc domains, signals inside the cell to block immune response activation pathways, for example the B‑cell receptor pathway that activates in response to antigen recognition and ultimately results in the production of antibodies to antigen. We have focused on this role as an important negative feedback regulator of the B‑cell response, where its biology is well‑validated. Its expression and signaling characteristics have made it a difficult target for monoclonal antibodies, as targeting it by itself does not trigger its inhibitory properties. FcγRIIb must be associated with other specific partner proteins on the cell surface to activate its inhibitory properties. We have circumvented this problem by discovering variants of the Fc domain with enhanced binding to FcγRIIb and designed the Fv domain to target a B‑cell protein. This coupling of the two target proteins, in some cases, will trigger the inhibitory properties of FcγRIIb.
 We have discovered a series of FcγRIIb immune inhibitor Fc variants with increased binding affinity to FcγRIIb of up to 400‑fold. The high affinity variant has two amino acid substitutions in the Fc domain and has been applied to create our first immune inhibitor product development candidate XmAb5871. We have also applied this high affinity Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain to our immune inhibitor development candidate, XmAb7195.
 XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain technology
 Our XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain technology consists of a series of variant Fc domains that improve binding to the activating Fcγ receptors. This binding improvement drives increased antibody‑dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), a primary mechanism of antibody cytotoxicity. The lead Fc variant used in nearly all of our Cytotoxic Fc Domain antibody candidates is an Fc domain with two amino acid substitutions that increase affinity for FcγRIIIa, the activating receptor 

 
  13

 
expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, by approximately 40‑fold. NK cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes of the innate immune system and play a major role in elimination of tumor cells and virally infected cells. Our XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain also increases affinity for FcγRIIa by approximately five‑fold, with potential for recruitment of other important effector cells such as macrophages, which play a role in both innate and adaptive immunity by engulfing and digesting foreign material. 
 Several partners and licensees are using our Cytotoxic Fc Domain in their oncology antibodies, including four programs currently in clinical trials; two programs currently in Phase 2 and two programs currently in Phase 1.
 XmAb Xtend Fc Domain technology
 Our XmAb Xtend Fc Domain technology consists of Fc domains designed to increase binding affinity to the receptor FcRn. FcRn is present inside lysosomes in endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and functions to rescue antibodies from the degradation that makes most proteins short‑lived in circulation. As a result of interactions with FcRn, all antibodies have half‑lives ranging from a few days to a few weeks, allowing less frequent dosing for antibody drugs than most other biologics. We have engineered a series of Fc variants that increase binding of the Fc domain to FcRn to enhance FcRn‑mediated rescue and thereby increase circulating half‑life. Our lead XmAb Xtend Fc Domain has two amino acid substitutions and has shown up to three‑fold increases of in vivo half‑life for a number of different antibodies in monkey models.
 We believe extension of half‑life can be exploited to improve therapeutic antibody performance in several ways including:

· | Increased dosing interval, providing superior patient convenience and likely compliance. Such a reduced frequency of dosing also results in lower drug use in aggregate, reducing cost of goods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lower drug quantities at the same dosing interval as the parent antibody. This can simplify dosage formulation and sometimes enable subcutaneous formulation. Cost of goods is reduced as well.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are currently two compounds that incorporate our XmAb Xtend technology in clinical trials including Alexion which achieved a Phase 3 clinical development milestone in 2016 with an undisclosed molecule to be used against an undisclosed target.  
 Additional XmAb Fc Domains
 We continue to design Fc domain variants and have identified improved functions in addition to those described above. Our goal is to remain at the forefront of antibody engineering by using our expertise in Fc domain engineering to create new functions for use in antibody therapeutics. We have Fc variants that improve complement‑dependent cytotoxicity. Other Fc variants have been engineered to eliminate binding to all Fcγ receptors, thereby creating Fc domains that have no cytotoxic effector function at all. Such domains have important use in therapeutics where no effector function is desired. Our Research and Development Pipeline
 We have used our various Fc platforms and antibody optimization capabilities to produce a growing pipeline of development candidates. These include XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain candidates designed to remove target antigens from circulation and multiple oncology candidates using our CD3 bispecific platform. We are also developing a series of bispecific checkpoint inhibitor candidates. We will continue to progress these candidates as additional options for clinical development by us or as out‑licensing opportunities.  We also from time to time in-license antibody technologies and compounds from other companies which we believe may allow us to create potential product candidates by incorporating our XmAb technology.  These in-licenses may require us to pay up-front fees, development and commercial milestone payments and if commercial products are approved, royalties.

 Market Opportunity
 XmAb5871: We are currently pursuing XmAb5871development for IgG4-RD, a newly designated disorder and SLE.  IgG4-RD is a fibro-inflammatory autoimmune disorder that we estimate impacts approximately 40,000 patients in the United States. IgG4-RD affects multiple organ systems and we believe is characterized by the distinct microscopic appearance of diseased organs, including the presence of IgG4-positive plasmablast cells that is required for diagnosis.  There are currently no approved therapies for IgG4-RD and glucocorticoids (hormone steroids) are the current standard of care treatment.
 The unmet need in SLE remains high for the estimated 240,000 Americans with a lupus diagnosis. Lupus is a serious and potentially fatal disease that mainly affects women. It is an autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels and brain. Patients are often subject to prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and potent immunosuppressive agents with significant short and long term side effects.   Current biologic treatments are limited by their modest efficacy or safety risks.  Because B cells play a significant role in SLE pathogenesis, we believe that XmAb5871is a potential treatment.  In addition to data from the Phase 1b/2a trial in RA, we have published ex vivo results showing XmAb5871 inhibition of SLE patient B cell activation and humoral immunity supporting the investigation of XmAb5871 as a potential SLE therapy.   
 XmAb7195: The potential indication for which we are currently pursuing XmAb7195 development is allergic asthma.  According to the CDC, asthma affects approximately one in 12 Americans, more than half of asthma sufferers have at least one attack each year and thousands of people die from asthma attacks each year. Disease severities cover a wide range, and the treatment landscape is multi-tiered for asthma patients. Patients with mild and moderate asthma are generally well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists. However, a small percentage of the estimated 25 million asthma patients in the United States have severe asthma and are refractory to high-dose combination therapy. This severe population is commonly treated with oral corticosteroids, which are associated with a host of undesirable side effects and are often insufficient to control the disease.
 XmAb14045, XmAb1367, XmAb18087 and XmAb20717: Our initial bispecific candidates are targeted toward oncology to treat cancer. Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2016 there will be approximately 1.7 million new cases of cancer and approximately 595,000 deaths from cancer. The National Institutes of Health estimates that based on growth and aging of the U.S. population, medical expenditures for cancer in the year 2020 are projected to reach at least $158 billion (in 2010 dollars). B-cell cancers include lymphomas such as NHL and leukemias such as CLL and ALL. Collectively, lymphomas and leukemias represent about three and five percent, respectively, of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates that over 20,000 new cases of AML and over 26,000 new cases of multiple myeloma were reported in the United States in 2015.
 Intellectual Property
 The foundation for our XmAb technology and our product candidates and partnering is the generation and protection of intellectual property for novel antibody therapeutics. We combine proprietary computational methods for amino acid sequence design with laboratory generation and testing of new antibody compositions. Our design and engineering team prospectively assesses, with patent counsel, the competitive landscape with the goal of building broad patent positions and avoiding third-party intellectual property. 
 As a pioneer in Fc domain engineering, we systematically scanned the structure of the Fc domain to discover Fc variants. We have filed patent applications relating to thousands of specific Fc domain variants with experimental data on specific improvements of immune function, pharmacokinetics, structural stability and novel structural constructs. We have filed additional patent applications derived from these applications as we discover new properties of the Fc variants and as new business opportunities arise. We continually seek to expand the intellectual property coverage of our technology and candidates, and invest in discovering new Fc domain technologies and antibody product candidates. 

 
  15

 

 Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes over 200 issued patents and pending patent applications which we own or for which we have a fully-paid exclusive license, with claims directed to XmAb Fc domains, all of our clinical and preclinical stage antibodies and our computational protein design methods, called the PDA, protein design platform. We also have a large number of issued patents and pending patent applications with claims directed specifically to our XmAb technology and candidates.  Our XmAb Fc domain, patents and patent applications, with claims directed to their incorporation into antibodies, Fc domain engineering and compositions of matter are expected to expire in the United States between 2023 and 2031. Our two Immune Inhibitor Fc domain lead product candidates are covered by issued U.S. composition of matter patents relating to both the XmAb Fc domains and the individual product candidates. The composition of matter patents relating to these lead product candidates are expected to expire in the United States between 2027 and 2030, two of which relate to XmAb5871 and two of which relate to XmAb7195. The composition of matter patents relating to our XmAb bispecific technology and patent candidates expire beginning in 2033 and 2034.  
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We seek to protect this intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of certain discoveries or inventions made by them. 
 Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We have obtained registrations for the Xencor trademark, as well as certain other trademarks, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our clinical-stage products, including XmAb, PDA and Protein Design Automation. We currently have registrations for Xencor and PDA in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Community and Japan, for Protein Design Automation in the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Community, and for XmAb in the United States, Australia and the European Community.
 Manufacturing
 We are able to internally manufacture the quantities of our product candidates required for relatively short preclinical animal studies. We believe that this allows us to accelerate the drug development process by not having to rely on third parties for all of our manufacturing needs.  We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) for the manufacture of drug substance and product, including XmAb5871, XmAb7195 and our bispecific development candidates, XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087 and XmAb20717. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This allows us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on developing our products. XmAb5871and XmAb7195 are produced by mammalian cell culture of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses the antibody, followed by multiple purification and filtration steps typical of those used for monoclonal antibodies. We do not have any long term manufacturing agreements in place and will ultimately depend on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products for commercial sale, as well as for process development.  We are currently in clinical trials with subcutaneous formulations for XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 which have been manufactured with third party contract manufacturers. Development and Manufacturing and Cell Line Sale Agreements with Catalent
 In September 2005, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement (the Catalent Manufacturing Agreement) with Catalent Pharma Solutions LLC (Catalent). Under the terms of the agreement, Catalent will, from time to time, provide development and manufacturing services for us. They are currently manufacturing drug substance for our XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 development programs.
 We have also entered into separate cell line sale agreements (Cell Line Agreements) for the XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 cell lines. Catalent manufactured the cell lines for the XmAb5871 and XmAb7195 programs using their proprietary GPEx® technology. Under the Catalent Manufacturing Agreement, we have an unrestricted license to the 

 
  16

 
GPEx cell lines provided that Catalent is manufacturing drug substance material from the cell line. The Cell Line Agreements allow us to transfer the manufacturing processes for either XmAb5871 or XmAb7195 to a third party manufacturer.  
 Upon transfer of the XmAb5817 or XmAb7195 cell line to a third party manufacturer, we will be required to make payments to Catalent based upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and will also pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales for products that are derived from or utilize the GPEx Cell Line. The royalty percentages under each Cell Line Agreement are less than 1.0%. 
 We have the unilateral right to terminate the Catalent Manufacturing Agreement upon 30 days written notice to Catalent. Absent early termination, the agreement will remain in effect. If we terminate the agreement without cause or if Catalent terminates the agreement for our material breach of the agreement, our ownership rights in the cell line will automatically terminate, and title will revert to Catalent.
 Cell Line Agreements with Selexis
 In December 2015, we entered into a Master Service Agreement (the Selexis Agreement) with Selexis SA (Selexis) for the manufacture of Selexis cell lines. Under the terms of the Selexis Agreement, Selexis will manufacture cell lines for Xencor provided antibody candidates and upon completion of the cell lines Xencor has the option to take an unrestricted commercial license to the cell line. The terms of each commercial license require Xencor to make upfront payments and payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and we will also pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales for products that are derived from or utilize the Selexis cell line. The royalty percentage is less than 1%.
 Selexis is currently manufacturing cell lines for our bispecific drug candidates and we currently have commercial licenses to the Selexis cell line for our XmAb14045 and XmAb13676 clinical candidates.
 License Agreement with BIO-TECHNE 

In February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with BIO-TECHNE Corporation  for a non-exclusive license to certain antibody technology including monoclonal antibodies which recognize human somatostatin reception 2. The variable domain of this antibody is incorporated in our XmAb18087 drug candidate. 

Under the terms of the Agreement, Xencor made an upfront payment and is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and will also pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales from products that are derived from the XmAb18087 program. The royalty percentage is less than 1%.
 License Agreement with Receptor Logic

In December 2015, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Receptor Logic, Inc. to research, develop, and commercialize products derived from antibodies that bind NY-eso-1 peptide in complex with MHC Class 1 HLA-A2. 

Under the terms of the Agreement, Xencor made an upfront payment and is obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain scientific, development and regulatory milestones and will also pay low single-digit royalties based on a percentage of net sales from products that are derived from the program.  
 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmBH
 In February 2012, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (BI) for the establishment of certain manufacturing processes and the production of our next generation monoclonal anti‑TNF antibody for use in our preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete Phase 1 clinical testing of the product and to find a licensing partner for the further development and commercialization of the antibody into a therapeutic product.

 
  17

 

 We will be required to pay for services performed and products provided by BI under the agreement pursuant to project plans entered into from time to time. In addition, we are required to reimburse BI for all out‑of‑pocket expenses, including the cost of raw materials, incurred in connection with the project plan. BI has agreed to delay all payments due to them under the agreement, including an annual interest rate which is a low double digit percentage, until (A) in the case where we have entered into a license agreement with a third party, the later of (1) the effective date of such license agreement or (2) the earlier of (i) completion of the clinical summary report for a Phase 1 clinical trial of the product or (ii) February 10, 2017 or (B) in the case where we decide to continue to develop the product on our own, on or before five years from the earlier of (i) completion of the clinical summary report for a Phase 1 clinical trial of the product or (ii) February 10, 2017. Any payments due by us in the situation described in clause (A) of the preceding sentence will be made in installments each of which will be limited to a maximum percentage of any licensing revenue that we receive under the applicable third‑party license. We are not obligated to pay BI any or all of the amounts owed under the agreement, including interest payments if we: (a) are not able to further develop the product for technical or scientific reasons or (b) do not decide to proceed with the further development of the product without a business partner and are unable to enter into a partnership agreement within an agreed upon period of time after Phase 1 clinical development.
 Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon completion of all projects set forth in the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice to the other party if such party will not be able to carry out the project contemplated by the agreement for scientific, technical or business reasons. 
 KBI Biopharma, Inc.
 In July 2014, we entered into a master services agreement (KBI Agreement) with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (KBI). We have engaged KBI under the KBI Agreement for process development, clinical scale-up, analytical method development, formulation development and other services related to drug substance and drug product for our bispecific development candidates, XmAb14045, XmAb13676, XmAb18087 and XmAb20717 in accordance with  cGMP regulations. For each bispecific program we have entered into a separate agreement with the terms and conditions of services and payment. The KBI Agreement is for a three year term but is automatically extended on an annual basis until the services are completed.  The KBI Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach that is not remedied within thirty days after notice or sixty days after notice of the existence of an incurable scientific or technical issue that renders KBI unable to render services under the KBI Agreement, by after sixty day notice, or in the event of a bankruptcy of a party.  For termination other than a material breach by KBI, we must pay for all services conducted prior to the termination and to wind down the activities. Competition
 We compete in an industry that is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. We compete with these parties for promising targets for antibody‑based therapeutics, new technology for optimizing antibodies and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research and product development capabilities as well as greater financial, marketing and sales and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in developing, commercializing and achieving widespread market acceptance. In addition, our competitors’ products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
 Competition in autoimmune disease drug development is intense and includes multiple monoclonal antibodies, other biologics and small molecules approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, many of which are being developed or marketed by large multinational pharmaceutical companies. Benlysta is currently the only monoclonal antibody that we are aware of that is approved for the treatment of lupus, although we believe that Rituxan is prescribed, off label, for this indication. In addition, other pharmaceutical companies have monoclonal antibodies or other biologics in clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. There are currently no approved therapies for IgG4-

 
  18

 
related disease, a newly recognized disorder, and glucocorticoids are the current standard of care, although we believe that Rituxan is prescribed, off label.
 Many companies have approved therapies or are developing drugs for the treatment of asthma including multinational pharmaceutical companies. Monoclonal antibody drug development has primarily focused on allergic asthma. Xolair is currently the only monoclonal antibody targeting IgE that we are aware of that is approved for the treatment of severe asthma. In addition, we are aware that Novartis and Genentech each have an antibody targeting IgE in clinical development for asthma. We are also aware of two antibodies for sever asthma that are marketed Nucala by GSK and Cinqair by Teva. Other monoclonal antibodies in development target cytokines such as IL‑13, IL‑4, IL‑5, IL‑9, GM‑CSF or their receptors. Although these drugs function differently from our products, if successfully developed, these drugs will compete in the asthma market. We are not aware of any companies developing drugs that target FcγRIIb for the treatment of asthma.
 Competition in blood cancer drug development is intense, with more than 250 compounds in clinical trials by large multinational pharmaceutical companies and Rituxan is just one of many monoclonal antibodies approved for the treatment of NHL or other blood cancers. In addition, we are aware of a number of other companies with development stage programs that may compete with the drug candidates we and our licenses are developing in the future. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
 Regulatory Overview
 Our business and operations are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local and foreign supranational, national, provincial and municipal laws, regulations and trade practices. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion and export and import of our product candidates. U.S. Government Regulation
 U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our antibody product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. The FDA or responsible Institutional Review Board may place a trial on hold at any time related to perceived risks to patient safety.

· | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects or, in some cases, patients with the disease for which the drug candidate is intended, and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.

· | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population (but larger than in Phase 1) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population (such as several hundred to several thousand) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.

  Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.

 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. 
 If the FDA determines that the BLA is substantially complete it will accept the BLA for filing.  This process generally takes eight months to a year but in some cases may take much longer.
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and it may inspect the manufacturing facilities to assure cGMP compliance and clinical sites used during the clinical trials to assure cGMP compliance. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS prior to approval. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA will issue a complete response letter describing deficiencies in the BLA and recommend actions if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The applicant will have to address all of the deficiencies which could take substantial time to address. 
 If the product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, and may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Any biologic products for which we or our collaborators receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance for product manufacture, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct‑to‑consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”), industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as product reclass, warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of any of our biologic product candidates, we may apply for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.  The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for one patent per product as compensation for patent term lost during 

 
  21

 
product development and the FDA regulatory review process of that product. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products generally not earlier than 12 years after the original BLA approval, although it can be shortened to four years if the biosimilar contains certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator BLA holders. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to existing brand product. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Significant uncertainty exists and will continue to exist as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors. Third-party payors include government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Formulary placement by third-party payors is very competitive and can lead to lower prices and may effectively restrict patient access to our drugs. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been and will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, once they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and 

 
  22

 
elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 Additional new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, as amended, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted anti-kickback statues and false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to the delivery of or payments for healthcare benefits, items or services.  HIPAA and its implementing regulations also established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we, and our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products, similar or more stringent than the U.S. laws.
 Whether or not we, or our collaborators, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of 

 
  23

 
the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we and our collaborators may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti‑kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the European Union’s Directive 95/46 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.
 If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 83 employees, all of whom were full‑time, 28 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 65 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 18 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support.
