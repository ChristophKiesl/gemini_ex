ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “our company” refer to Lazard Growth Acquisition Corp. I.
 We are a blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (an “initial business combination”). Lazard Ltd, an affiliate of our sponsor, LGACo 1 LLC (the “sponsor”), intends to use resources across its international financial advisory and asset management businesses to source and evaluate attractive, high growth private companies. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a target company, we believe the growth-oriented subsectors of the healthcare, technology, energy transition, financial and consumer sectors present particularly attractive investment opportunities. 
 On December 17, 2020, the sponsor paid an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.0017 per share, to subscribe for an aggregate of 14,375,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “founder shares”). Up to 1,875,000 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by the sponsor, depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option was exercised. As a result of the underwriter’s exercise of the over-allotment option in full, 1,875,000 of the founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
 On February 12, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 57,500,000 of our units (the “units”), including 7,500,000 units sold upon exercise in full of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”), and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant (the “public warrants”), with each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $575,000,000.
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the units, the Company consummated the sale to the sponsor of 9,000,000 private placement warrants (the “private placement warrants”), with each private placement warrant exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $13,500,000. The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants, except that, so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) they will be entitled to registration rights. 
 A total of $575,000,000, comprised of $563,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and $11,500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “trust account”). 
 Transaction costs amounted to $32,432,846, consisting of $11,500,000 of underwriting fees (a net underwriting fee of $8,500,000 after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement of the Company for $3,000,000 of financial advisory fees payable by the Company to Lazard Frères & Co. LLC), $20,125,000 of deferred underwriting fees (as may be reduced as a result of the underwriter’s reimbursement to the Company for certain financial advisory fees payable by the Company to Lazard Frères & Co. LLC) and $807,846 of other offering costs. In addition, cash of $1,812,418 was held outside of the trust account and is available for working capital purposes and payment of IPO expenses.
