Item 1.   Business
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
Overview
We are a leading branded apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands and other brands. Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, in the aggregate, represent more than 85% of our net sales and 97% of our sales were in the United States. 
Our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection, like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. Our ability to compete successfully in the apparel industry is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.
To further strengthen each lifestyle brand’s connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through digital and print media on a regular basis. We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of our brands. Advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product.
During Fiscal 2020, 77% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution, which consists of our 187 brand-specific full-price retail stores, our e-commerce websites, our 20 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations and our 35 Tommy Bahama outlet stores. During Fiscal 2020, our e-commerce, retail (including outlet) and restaurant operations represented 43%, 27%, and 7%, respectively, of our net sales compared to 23%, 39%, and 8%, respectively, in Fiscal 2019. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a digital or physical setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. 
Our full-price retail stores allow us the opportunity to carry a full line of current season merchandise, including apparel, accessories and other products, all presented in an aspirational brand-specific atmosphere. We believe that our full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers. Further, we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the full-price retail stores with limited in-store promotional activities are good for our lifestyle brands and, in turn, enhance business with our wholesale customers. While about one-half of our retail locations are located in resort or travel to destinations and states, we believe there are also opportunities in both warmer and colder climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting.
Our e-commerce business continues to grow, with e-commerce sales in Fiscal 2020 totaling $324 million and representing 43% of our net sales. Our growing e-commerce business is very profitable for our lifestyle brands as each brand has average e-commerce order values in excess of $100 and a high full-price gross margin in the 70% range. This 

7



provides a significant amount of profit that is available to pay for the incremental picking, packing and freight expense associated with an e-commerce sale. 
We also operate 20 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations, including 14 restaurants and six Marlin Bars, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand’s image with consumers and 35 Tommy Bahama outlet stores, which play an important role in overall inventory and brand management. Our e-commerce websites provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products.
The remaining 23% of our net sales in Fiscal 2020 was generated from our wholesale distribution channels. Our wholesale operations include sales of our lifestyle brands, which complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers, and also includes the net sales of the Lanier Apparel operating group, which we are exiting in the second half of Fiscal 2021. Our wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands include sales to various specialty stores, Signature Stores, better department stores, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and other retailers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach.
Each of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide and Lanier Apparel operating groups operates in highly competitive apparel markets. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. The apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries.
The retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. Many of the changes in the industry were accelerated or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods, which continues to be evidenced by weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. These changes may require that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, very differently than historical practices and may result in increased operating costs and capital investments to generate growth or even maintain current sales levels. 
Investments and Opportunities
While the evolution in the fashion retail industry (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers and others who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our lifestyle brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry, including the near-term challenges resulting from COVID-19. Further, each of our brands aim to further enhance their customer-focused, dynamic, thriving, digitally-driven, mobile-centered, cross-channel personalized and seamless shopping experience that recognizes and serves customers in their brand discovery and purchasing habits of the future. 
Meanwhile, we must be very diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is 

8



particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented 9% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2020. 
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, an important initiative for us has been to increase the profitability of our Tommy Bahama operating group, which is our largest operating group. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we made progress in recent years on this initiative, which remains a focus area for the long-term prospects of the business and continues to focus on increasing gross margin and operating margin through: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; and taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals.
In order to maximize the success of each of our brands, we believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Future investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations, such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and retail store and food and beverage build-out for new, relocated or remodeled locations, as well as distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. 
While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria. 
In Fiscal 2020, we made the decision to exit our Lanier Apparel business, which is expected to be completed during the second half of Fiscal 2021. In Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, Lanier Apparel, which has primarily sold tailored clothing products, represented 5% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. This decision is in line with our stated business strategy of developing and marketing compelling lifestyle brands and takes into consideration the increased challenges faced by the Lanier Apparel business, many of which were magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Important factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on overall economic conditions and our operations and is the primary reason for a 33% reduction in net sales and a significant net loss in Fiscal 2020, after years of profitable operating results. While our mission remains the enhancement of long-term shareholder value, our focus during this crisis has been (1) the health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, (2) protecting the reputation, value and image of our brands and (3) preserving liquidity. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw reduced consumer traffic starting in early March 2020 and temporarily closed all our retail and restaurant locations. We began reopening our stores and restaurants in early May 2020 with additional stores and restaurants reopening throughout the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020. We have reopened substantially all of our direct to consumer locations using a phased approach in accordance with local government guidelines and with additional safety protocols. Substantially all locations are experiencing reduced traffic, limited operating hours and capacity, seating and other limitations, with such factors impacting individual locations differently. Certain retail stores and restaurants, including several in Hawaii and California, were required to close again for certain periods in the Third and Fourth Quarters of Fiscal 2020 after local jurisdictions reinstated some closure requirements. There can be no assurance that additional closures will not occur as a result of any resurgence of COVID-19 cases and/or additional government mandates or recommendations. Generally, locations with attached restaurants or Marlin Bars, in outdoor centers and in drivable resort vacation destinations performed better than locations in indoor malls in Fiscal 2020. At the same time, the shift from in-store shopping to online shopping has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a 24% growth in our e-commerce businesses during Fiscal 2020. 
There is significant uncertainty as to the duration and severity of the pandemic as well as the associated business disruption, impact on discretionary spending and restrictions on our ongoing operations. Thus, the ultimate 

9



impact of the pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in the near-term due to the anticipated lower net sales from our bricks and mortar locations; reduced demand from our wholesale customers, several of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 or are undergoing restructurings or closures; the uncertainty as to the continued strength of our brands’ e-commerce businesses during the pendency of the pandemic and thereafter; overall changes in consumer spending habits and consumer confidence; any potential disruptions to our supply chain; and a slowdown in the U.S. and global economies.
We took several actions in Fiscal 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and liquidity, which included: 

● | we furloughed and laid off a significant number of our retail, restaurant and office employees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | certain salaried employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executives, took temporary reductions in base salary during Fiscal 2020;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Board of Directors elected to reduce its cash retainers for Fiscal 2020;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we worked with our suppliers to cancel, delay or suspend future product deliveries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we worked with our wholesale customers to identify suitable changes to our business arrangements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we negotiated equitable rental arrangements with substantially all of our direct to consumer location landlords, believing that the payment of rents for both the closure and subsequent periods is inappropriate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are continuing those discussions with some landlords;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | under the CARES Act, and other regulations in other countries, we obtained employee retention credits for certain compensation paid to employees even while they were not working during the COVID-19 pandemic and have deferred the payment of the employer portion of FICA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we suspended, cancelled or deferred certain capital expenditure projects, reducing our capital expenditures for Fiscal 2020;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | during much of Fiscal 2020, we had drawn down certain amounts on our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Board of Directors reduced the rate of our dividend payable for Fiscal 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, we established management committees, reporting to our Chief Executive Officer, to continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact and are taking the necessary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. 
We anticipate that net sales in each of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide operating groups will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2021, with the impact being more pronounced in the first half of the year and then beginning to rebound a little more in the second half of the year once more consumers are vaccinated, begin to travel again or otherwise begin to return to a more normal way of life. 
Given our net cash position as of January 30, 2021, substantial availability under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement and expectation of positive cash flows from operations in Fiscal 2021, among other factors, we believe we have adequate liquidity and the financial discipline to address the near-term challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to position ourselves well to thrive in the post-pandemic retail environment.

Operating Groups
We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand’s direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable. Our business has historically been operated primarily through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide and Lanier Apparel operating groups. In Fiscal 2020, we made the decision to exit our Lanier Apparel business, which is expected to be completed during the second half of Fiscal 2021. For additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, each included in this report. The table below presents certain financial information about each of our operating groups, as well as Corporate and Other (in thousands).

Tommy Bahama
Tommy Bahama designs, sources, markets and distributes men’s and women’s sportswear and related products. Tommy Bahama’s typical consumer is older than 45 years old, has a household annual income in excess of $100,000, lives in or travels to warm weather and resort locations and embraces a relaxed and casual approach to daily living. Tommy Bahama products can be found in our Tommy Bahama stores and on our Tommy Bahama e-commerce website, tommybahama.com, as well as at better department stores, independent specialty stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers. We also operate Tommy Bahama restaurants and license the Tommy Bahama name for various product categories. During Fiscal 2020, 95% of Tommy Bahama’s sales were to customers within the United States, with the remaining sales in Canada and Australia.
We believe that the attraction to our consumers of the Tommy Bahama brand, which was founded in 1992, is a reflection of our efforts over many years to maintain appropriate quality and design of our Tommy Bahama apparel, accessories and licensed products, limit the distribution of Tommy Bahama products to a select tier of retailers, and effectively communicate the relaxed and casual Tommy Bahama lifestyle. We expect to continue to follow this approach for the brand in the future. 
We believe there are ample opportunities to expand the direct to consumer reach of the Tommy Bahama brand in the future, while maintaining its historically select distribution. In order to take advantage of opportunities for long-

11



term growth, we must continue to invest in the Tommy Bahama brand. These investments include capital expenditures and ongoing expenses to enhance e-commerce and other technology capabilities; open new stores and restaurants; remodel and/or relocate existing stores and restaurants; maintain and upgrade our distribution and other facilities; and enhance our marketing efforts to communicate the lifestyle to existing and prospective consumers.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, an important initiative for us has been to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama operating group. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we made progress in recent years on this initiative, which remains a focus area for the long-term prospects of the business and continues to focus on increasing gross margin and operating margin through: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; and taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals.
Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Tommy Bahama strategy is to operate our own stores, restaurants and e-commerce websites, which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which the products are based. Our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer channels, which consist of retail store, e-commerce and restaurant operations, in the aggregate, represented 84% and 80% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Retail store, e-commerce and restaurant net sales accounted for 37%, 36% and 11%, respectively, of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 compared to 48%, 20% and 12%, respectively, in Fiscal 2019.
Our direct to consumer strategy for the Tommy Bahama brand includes locating and operating full-price retail stores in upscale malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. Generally, we seek to locate our full-price retail stores in shopping areas and malls that have high-profile or upscale consumer brand adjacencies. As of January 30, 2021, the majority of our Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores were in street-front locations or lifestyle centers with the remainder primarily in regional indoor malls, with a number of those regional indoor locations in resort travel destinations. We believe that we have opportunities for continued direct to consumer sales growth for our Tommy Bahama women’s business, which represented 29% of sales in our full-price direct to consumer operations in Fiscal 2020. 
Disposal of discontinued or end of season inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business and Tommy Bahama uses its outlet stores, sales to off-price retailers and selected initial markdowns in our full-price retail stores and on our e-commerce websites to sell its end of season or excess inventory. Our Tommy Bahama outlet stores, which generated 7% and 9% of our total Tommy Bahama net sales in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, are generally located in outlet shopping centers that include other upscale retailers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by often allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties. We believe that this approach has helped us protect the integrity of the Tommy Bahama brand by allowing our full-price retail stores to limit promotional activity while controlling the distribution of discontinued and out-of-season product. To supplement the clearance items sold in Tommy Bahama outlets, we merchandise our Tommy Bahama outlets with some made-for products. We anticipate that we would generally expect to operate one outlet for approximately every three full-price retail stores. 
As of January 30, 2021, we operated 20 Tommy Bahama food and beverage locations including 14 restaurants and six Marlin Bar locations, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location. These retail-food and beverage locations, which generated approximately 25% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2019, provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate Tommy Bahama experience. We do not anticipate that the majority of our retail locations will have an adjacent food and beverage location; however, we have determined that an adjacent food and beverage location can further enhance the image or exposure of the brand in select, high-profile, brand appropriate locations. The net sales per square foot in our domestic full-price retail stores that are adjacent to a food and beverage location have historically been twice the sales per square foot of our other domestic full-price retail stores. We believe that the customer immersing themselves into the Tommy Bahama lifestyle by having a meal or a drink at the Tommy Bahama food and beverage location and visiting the adjacent retail store may entice the customer to purchase additional Tommy Bahama merchandise and potentially provide a memorable consumer experience that further 

12



enhances the relationship between Tommy Bahama and the consumer. The Marlin Bar concept, like our traditional restaurant locations, is adjacent to one of our retail locations and serves food and beverages, but in a smaller space and with food options more focused on small plate offerings rather than entrees. We believe that with the smaller footprint, reduced labor requirements and lower required capital expenditure for build-out, the Marlin Bar concept provides us with the long-term potential for opening retail-food and beverage locations in sites that otherwise may not have been suitable or brand appropriate for one of our traditional retail-restaurant locations.
The table below provides certain information regarding Tommy Bahama retail stores and restaurants operated by us as of January 30, 2021.

During Fiscal 2020 Florida, California, Texas and Hawaii represented 35%, 17%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of our Tommy Bahama retail and restaurant sales, while in Fiscal 2019, Florida, California, Texas and Hawaii represented 27%, 17%, 9% and 12%, respectively, of our Tommy Bahama retail and restaurant sales.

​
In future periods, we anticipate that many of our new store openings will be Marlin Bar locations that are new locations or replace existing full-price retail store or traditional restaurant locations. Currently, we have two openings scheduled for Fiscal 2021 including the Marlin Bar at Fashion Valley in San Diego, which opened in February 2021, and the conversion of the Tommy Bahama retail-restaurant location in Las Vegas to a Marlin Bar, which is scheduled to open in the second half of the year. We continue to look for other appropriate locations for retail stores and Marlin Bars. We believe that in Fiscal 2021, we may close a limited number of locations.

The operation of full-price retail stores, outlet stores, Marlin Bars and retail-restaurant locations requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. The cost of a traditional Tommy Bahama retail-restaurant location and a Marlin Bar is significantly more than the cost of a full-price retail store and can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. Historically, the cost of our retail-restaurant locations has been approximately $5 million and the cost of our Marlin Bar locations has been approximately $3 million; however, the cost of a restaurant and Marlin Bar can vary significantly for certain locations. For most of our retail stores and our retail-food and beverage locations, the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs related to periodic remodels of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires, and we determine it is appropriate to relocate to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store. Alternatively, when a lease expires we may decide to close the store rather than relocating the store to another location or renewing the lease. The capital cost of store relocations is generally comparable to the costs of opening a new full-price retail store or outlet store. 
In addition to our full-price retail stores and outlet stores, our direct to consumer approach includes various e-commerce websites, including the tommybahama.com website. During Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, e-commerce sales represented 36% and 20%, respectively, of Tommy Bahama’s net sales. Our Tommy Bahama website allows consumers to buy Tommy Bahama products directly from us via the internet. These websites also enable us to increase our database of consumer contacts, which allows us to communicate directly and frequently with consenting consumers. As we reach more customers in the future, we anticipate that our e-commerce distribution channel for Tommy Bahama will continue to grow at a faster pace than our domestic full-price retail store operations or wholesale operations.
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we continue to maintain our wholesale operations for Tommy Bahama. Tommy Bahama’s wholesale customers include better department stores, specialty stores and multi-brand e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. We value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Tommy Bahama brand within their stores.
Wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama accounted for 16% and 20% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Approximately 9% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales reflects sales to major department stores with our remaining wholesale sales primarily sales to specialty stores. During Fiscal 2020, 12% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales were to Tommy Bahama’s 10 largest wholesale customers, with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Tommy Bahama’s net sales.
We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Tommy Bahama brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution, with careful selection of the retailers through which Tommy Bahama products are sold. As a result of our approach to limiting our wholesale distribution, we believe that sales growth in our men’s apparel wholesale business may be somewhat limited in the long-term. However, we believe that we may have opportunities for wholesale sales increases for our Tommy Bahama women’s business in the future, with its appeal evidenced by its performance in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites.
Lilly Pulitzer
Lilly Pulitzer designs, sources, markets and distributes upscale collections of women’s and girl’s dresses, sportswear and related products. The Lilly Pulitzer brand was originally created in the late 1950s by Lilly Pulitzer and is an affluent brand with a heritage and aesthetic based on the Palm Beach resort lifestyle. The brand is somewhat unique among women’s brands in that it has demonstrated multi-generational appeal, including among young women in college or recently graduated from college; young mothers with their daughters; and women who are not tied to the academic calendar. Lilly Pulitzer products can be found in our owned Lilly Pulitzer stores, in Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores, which are described below, and on our Lilly Pulitzer website, lillypulitzer.com, as well as in better department and

independent specialty stores. During Fiscal 2020, 50% and 33% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales were for women’s sportswear and dresses, respectively, with the remaining sales consisting of Lilly Pulitzer accessories, including scarves, bags, jewelry and belts, children’s apparel, footwear and licensed products.
We believe that there are opportunities to expand the reach of the Lilly Pulitzer brand in the future, while at the same time maintaining its historically select distribution. We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Lilly Pulitzer brand. These investments include enhancing e-commerce and other technology capabilities; opening and operating full-price retail stores; remodeling and/or relocating existing stores; and increasing headcount, advertising and other functions to support the business. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on Lilly Pulitzer’s operating margin, particularly if there is insufficient sales growth to absorb the incremental costs in a particular year.
We believe the attraction of the Lilly Pulitzer brand to our consumers is a reflection of years of maintaining appropriate quality and design, restricting the distribution of Lilly Pulitzer products to a select tier of retailers and effectively communicating the message of Lilly Pulitzer’s optimistic Palm Beach resort chic lifestyle. We believe this approach to quality, design, distribution and communication has been critical in allowing us to achieve the current retail price points for Lilly Pulitzer products. 
Direct to Consumer Operations
Lilly Pulitzer’s direct to consumer distribution channel, which consists of full-price retail store and e-commerce operations, represented 84% and 79% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. A key element of our Lilly Pulitzer strategy is the lillypulitzer.com website, which represented 64% and 38% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Another key component of our Lilly Pulitzer direct to consumer strategy is to operate our own Lilly Pulitzer stores, which represented 20% and 41% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.
The Lilly Pulitzer e-commerce business has experienced significant growth in recent years, and we anticipate that the net sales growth of the e-commerce business will remain strong in the future. We also use the Lilly Pulitzer website as an effective means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner and at gross margins in excess of 40% via e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales are brand appropriate events that create a significant amount of excitement with loyal Lilly Pulitzer consumers, who are looking for an opportunity to purchase Lilly Pulitzer products at a discounted price. These e-commerce flash clearance sales typically run for three days during the summer clearance period in September and for two days during the post-holiday clearance period in January, allowing the Lilly Pulitzer website to generally remain full-price for the remaining 360 days of the year. During Fiscal 2020, approximately one-third of Lilly Pulitzer’s e-commerce sales were e-commerce flash clearance sales. In addition to the e-commerce flash clearance events, in Fiscal 2020, we did have a few select promotional events to sell inventory that had previously been purchased for sale in our retail stores during the year. 
Our Lilly Pulitzer retail stores permit us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting Lilly Pulitzer products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which they are based. Our retail store strategy for the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes operating full-price retail stores in higher-end lifestyle shopping centers and malls, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. As of January 30, 2021, about 40% of our Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in outdoor regional lifestyle centers and approximately one-third of our Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in indoor regional malls, with the remaining locations in resort or street locations. In certain seasonal locations such as Nantucket and Watch Hill, our stores are only open during the resort season. Additionally, we may open temporary pop-up stores in certain locations.

​
Currently, we are negotiating leases for certain retail store locations and will continue to look for other appropriate locations. We believe that in Fiscal 2021, we may close a limited number of locations. The operation of full-price retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We anticipate that most future full-price retail store openings will generally be 2,500 square feet or less on average; however, the determination of actual size of the store will depend on a variety of criteria. 
In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels or expansions of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We may also incur capital expenditures if we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location. The capital cost of store relocations, if any, will generally be comparable to the cost of opening a new store. 
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we continue to maintain our wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer. These wholesale operations are primarily with Signature Stores, independent specialty stores, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. During Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, approximately 16% and 21%, respectively, of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales were sales to wholesale customers. During Fiscal 2020, about one-third of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales were to Lilly Pulitzer’s Signature Stores, one-fourth of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales were to specialty stores and about one-fifth of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale sales, or less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales, were to department stores. The remaining wholesale sales were primarily to national accounts, including on-line retailers, and off-price retailers. Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales to its 10 largest wholesale customers represented 9% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales in Fiscal 2020 with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer’s net sales.

16



An important part of Lilly Pulitzer’s wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For these stores, we enter into agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all floor space specifically for Lilly Pulitzer products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. We sell products to these Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of January 30, 2021, there were 44 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores.
We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Lilly Pulitzer products are sold. We continue to value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand within their stores. 
Southern Tide
We acquired the Southern Tide lifestyle apparel brand in Fiscal 2016. Southern Tide designs, sources, markets and distributes high-quality apparel bearing the distinctive Skipjack logo. Southern Tide offers an extensive selection of men’s shirts, pants, shorts, outerwear, ties, swimwear, footwear and accessories, as well as women’s and youth collections. Launched in 2006, Southern Tide combines the modern design elements of today’s youthful trends with love for the Southern culture and lifestyle. The brand has an appeal to all ages who have an appreciation for classic design, vibrant colors and a great fit and an affection for the coast. Southern Tide products can be found at independent specialty retailers, better department stores, Southern Tide Signature Stores which are described below, our Southern Tide website, southerntide.com, and our three Southern Tide retail stores. During Fiscal 2020, 64% of Southern Tide’s sales were wholesale sales, 32% of Southern Tide’s sales were e-commerce sales and 4% of Southern Tide’s sales were retail store sales.
We believe that there is significant opportunity to expand the reach of the Southern Tide brand by further increasing the wholesale presence of the brand and growing the direct to consumer business including e-commerce and retail sales. We believe that wholesale growth and expansion will be at a prudent pace as we believe that the integrity and success of the Southern Tide brand is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Southern Tide products are sold. We anticipate that the direct to consumer operations will grow at a faster pace than wholesale operations fueled by the addition of more owned Southern Tide retail stores in future years, as well as continued growth in our Southern Tide e-commerce operations. We opened the first owned Southern Tide retail store in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2019, and had two additional store openings in Fiscal 2020. 
We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Southern Tide brand. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on Southern Tide’s operating margin given the current size of the Southern Tide business. 
Wholesale Operations
At this time, Southern Tide’s business is predominantly a wholesale business with sales to independent specialty stores, department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores. Southern Tide’s wholesale operations provide an opportunity to grow our business and have access to a large group of consumers. During Fiscal 2020, approximately 16% and 7% of Southern Tide’s sales were to department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores, respectively. Southern Tide’s net sales to its 10 largest wholesale customers represented 30% of Southern Tide’s net sales in Fiscal 2020, with its largest customer representing 12% of Southern Tide’s net sales.
A component of Southern Tide’s wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For Signature Stores, we enter into license agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Southern Tide Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all floor space specifically for Southern Tide products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. We sell products to these Southern Tide Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of 

17



January 30, 2021, there were 18 Signature Stores including stores in Florida, Massachusetts, South Carolina and North Carolina. We anticipate some additional Signature Stores opening in the future. In addition, we believe there is opportunity for wholesale growth for Southern Tide in women’s apparel, which represented 18% of Southern Tide’s net sales in Fiscal 2020.
Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Southern Tide growth strategy is to expand our direct to consumer operations, which consists of the Southern Tide website and retail store operations. The Southern Tide website markets a full line of merchandise, including apparel and accessories, all presented in a manner intended to enhance the Southern Tide image, brand awareness and acceptance. We believe our Southern Tide website enables us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. In addition to off-price retailers, we also use the Southern Tide website as a means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner. During the year, we have a number of e-commerce clearance sales events, which are typically in industry end of season promotional periods.
In the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2019, we opened our first owned Southern Tide retail store in Jacksonville, Florida. In Fiscal 2020, we opened retail stores in Fort Lauderdale and Destin, Florida. In Fiscal 2021, we plan to open a retail store in Islamadora, Florida and we continue to look at additional opportunities for locations that may open later in the year. In the last couple of years, we prepared for these store openings and roll-out by supplementing the Southern Tide leadership team with retail management experience.
The operation of full-price retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We anticipate that most future full-price retail store openings will generally be approximately 2,000 square feet on average; however, the determination of actual size of the store will depend on a variety of criteria. We anticipate that for most of our full-price retail stores, the landlord will provide certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
Lanier Apparel
In Fiscal 2020, we made the decision to exit our Lanier Apparel business, which is expected to be completed during the second half of Fiscal 2021. This decision is in line with our stated business strategy of developing and marketing compelling lifestyle brands and takes into consideration the increased challenges faced by the Lanier Apparel business, many of which were magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men’s apparel, primarily consisting of tailored clothing and casual pants, across a wide range of price points, but primarily at moderate price points. The moderate price point tailored clothing market has been an extremely competitive sector for years, with significant retail competition as well as increasing gross margin pressures due to retail sales price pressures and production cost increases. 
The majority of our Lanier Apparel products were historically sold under certain trademarks licensed to us by third parties including Kenneth Cole®, Dockers®, Cole Haan® and Nick Graham®. Additionally, we designed and marketed products for our owned Billy London®, Oxford®, and Strong Suit® brands. In addition to these branded businesses, Lanier Apparel designed and sourced private label apparel products for certain customers. Lanier Apparel products are sold through large retailers including department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and others. 
In Lanier Apparel, we historically had long-standing relationships with some of the United States’ largest retailers, including department stores which represented approximately 30% of Lanier Apparel’s sales in Fiscal 2020. Lanier Apparel’s three largest customers represented 20%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of Lanier Apparel’s net sales in Fiscal 2020, while sales to Lanier Apparel’s 10 largest customers represented more than 77% of Lanier Apparel’s net sales during Fiscal 2020. Approximately 70% of Lanier Apparel’s product purchases were from manufacturers located in Vietnam, with a significant concentration of purchases from just a few manufacturers.

Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, the elimination of inter-segment sales and any other items that are not allocated to the operating groups including LIFO accounting adjustments. Because our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the operating groups. Corporate and Other also includes the operations of other businesses which are not included in our four operating groups. The operations of TBBC, Duck Head® and our Lyons, Georgia distribution center are included in Corporate and Other. TBBC designs, sources, markets and distributes premium childrenswear including bonnets, hats, apparel, swimwear and accessories through the TBBC e-commerce website, thebeaufortbonnetcompany.com, as well as wholesale specialty retailers. Duck Head designs, sources, markets and distributes premium men’s apparel including pants, shorts and tops through the Duck Head e-commerce website, duckhead.com, as well as wholesale specialty retailers. 
TRADEMARKS
We own trademarks, many of which are very important and valuable to our business including Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide. Generally, our trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on apparel and, in some cases, apparel-related products, accessories, home furnishings and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services. We continue to evaluate our worldwide usage and registration of our trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services in the relevant jurisdiction and the required registration renewals are filed. Important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
During Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, we incurred $50 million and $56 million, respectively of advertising expense. Advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy for our lifestyle brands, and we therefore devote significant resources to these efforts. Thus, we believe that it is very important that our brands communicate regularly with consumers about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen connections with consumers. Our advertising emphasizes the respective brand’s image and lifestyle and attempts to engage individuals within the target consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our e-commerce websites, retail stores or wholesale customers’ stores and websites in search of our products. 
We increasingly utilize digital marketing, social media and email, as well as direct mail, to interact with consumers. Our marketing may also include sponsorships, collaborations, and co-branding initiatives, which may be for a particular cause or non-profit organization that is expected to resonate with target consumers, and traditional media such as catalogs, print and other correspondence with consumers.
We vary our engagement tactics to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, drive conversion, build loyalty, activate consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Our creative marketing teams design and produce imagery and content, social media strategies, email and print campaigns designed to drive traffic to our direct to consumer locations and websites as well as to increase influencer amplification. We attempt to increase our brand awareness through a strategic emphasis on technology and continuing to elevate our digital presence which encompasses e-commerce, mobile e-commerce, digital media, social media and influencer marketing. We are also investing in analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels. We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g. loyalty, ratings and reviews and mobile phone applications) and build brand equity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on consumer behaviors and has accelerated the trend for a digital first consumer. This provided a catalyst for accelerating the implementation of new direct to consumer business models and consumer engagement programs, such as selling through social media.

19



Marketing initiatives in our direct to consumer operations may include special event promotions, including loyalty award card, Flip Side, Friends & Family and gift with purchase events and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our brands and products, drive traffic to our websites and stores, convert new consumers and increase demand and loyalty. Our various initiatives are effective in increasing online and in-store traffic resulting in the proportion of our sales that occur during our marketing initiatives increasing in recent years, which puts some downward pressure on our direct to consumer gross margins. 
We believe that highly visible full-price retail store locations with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit and buy merchandise. We believe that full-price retail stores attract new consumers and enhance the shopping experience of our existing customers, which will increase consumer brand loyalty, our net sales and sales of our products for our wholesale customers. 
For certain of our wholesale customers, we may also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs. 
PRODUCT DESIGN
We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value, and image of brand names; design of differentiated, innovative or otherwise compelling product; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. Our ability to compete successfully in the apparel industry is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season.
Each of our lifestyle brands’ products are designed and developed by dedicated brand-specific teams who focus on the target consumer for the respective brand. The design process includes feedback from buyers, consumers and sales agents, along with market trend research. Our apparel products generally incorporate fabrics made of cotton, silk, linen, nylon, leather, tencel and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials. 
PRODUCT SOURCING AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
We intend to maintain flexible, diversified, cost-effective sourcing operations that provide high-quality apparel and related products. Our operating groups, either internally, using in-house employees located in the United States and/or Hong Kong, or through the use of third party buying agents, manage the production and sourcing of substantially all of our apparel and related products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries. 
Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers of apparel and related products and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years, generally we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. Instead, we conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Thus, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality, cost, timing of product delivery and other criteria. We generally acquire products sold in our restaurant operations from various third party domestic suppliers. During Fiscal 2020, no individual third party manufacturer, licensee or other supplier provided more than 10% of our product purchases in total or for our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer operating groups, while the purchases for our smaller operating groups and businesses each had certain vendors that provided more than 10% of product purchases. During Fiscal 2020, we purchased our products from approximately 300 suppliers with the 10 largest suppliers providing approximately 25% of our product purchases. 
The production of our apparel and related products has a significant concentration in Asia. During Fiscal 2020 approximately 35% and 22%, compared to 49% and 18% for Fiscal 2019, of our apparel and related products, excluding restaurant products, acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China and Vietnam, respectively with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. For Fiscal 2020, the percentage of products sourced from China for our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer operating groups were 47% and 28%, 

20



respectively, with the percentage concentration from China for both operating groups decreasing from the prior year. We expect that the percentage of our products sourced from producers located in China will decrease further. 
We purchase substantially all of our apparel and related products from third party producers as package purchases of finished goods, which are manufactured with oversight by us or our third party buying agents and to our design and fabric specifications. The use of contract manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us, as operating manufacturing facilities can require a significant amount of capital investment. We depend on third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of specified raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. We believe that purchasing substantially all of our products as package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we are not required to purchase, or finance the purchase of, the raw materials or other production costs related to our apparel and related product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods, which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers. In addition to purchasing products from third parties, our Lanier Apparel operating group operated an owned manufacturing facility located in Merida, Mexico, which ceased operations in Fiscal 2020.
As the design, manufacture and transportation of apparel and related products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season, we typically make commitments months in advance of when products will arrive in our retail stores or our wholesale customers’ stores. We continue to seek ways to reduce the time required from design and ordering to bringing products to our customers. As our merchandising departments must estimate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own retail stores and e-commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors, and as purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to prior to the receipt of customer orders, we carry the risk that we have purchased more inventory than will ultimately be desired or that we will not have purchased sufficient inventory to satisfy demand, resulting in lost sales opportunities.
As part of our commitment to source our products in a lawful, ethical and socially responsible manner, each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors from whom we purchase apparel and related products, which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business or ethical standards, including related human rights, health, safety, working conditions, environmental and other requirements. We require that each of our vendors and licensees comply with the applicable code of conduct or substantially similar compliance standards. All of our vendors from whom we purchase goods are also required by us to adhere to the United States Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program, including standards relating to facility, procedural, personnel and cargo security. On an ongoing basis we assess vendors’ compliance with the applicable code of conduct and applicable laws and regulations through audits performed by either our employees or our designated agents. The assessment of compliance by vendors is directed by our corporate leadership team. In the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by our required standards, we work with the vendor to remediate the violation. If the violation is not satisfactorily remediated, we will discontinue use of the vendor. For more information on our initiatives with respect to corporate social responsibility, please visit our website at oxfordinc.com.
IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
We are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations as substantially all of our merchandise, as well as the products purchased by our licensing partners, is manufactured by foreign suppliers. During Fiscal 2020, approximately 35% and 22% of our apparel and related products, excluding restaurant products, acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China and Vietnam, respectively, with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. Products imported by us, or imported by others and ultimately sold to us, are subject to customs, trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the United States and other countries where we sell our products, including various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern any of our activities that may have adverse environmental, health and safety effects. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant monetary penalties.
Substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to certain duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product. These amounts represent a component of the inventories we sell and are included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations. We paid total duties of more than $30 million and $45 million on 

21



products imported into the United States directly by us in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, with the average duty rate on those products of approximately 17% of the value of the imported product in Fiscal 2020. Duty rates vary depending on the type of garment, fiber content and country of origin and are subject to change in future periods. In addition, while the World Trade Organization’s member nations have eliminated quotas on apparel and textiles, the United States and other countries into which we import our products are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose "anti-dumping" or "countervailing" duties in response to threats to their comparable domestic industries.
Although we have not been materially inhibited from sourcing products from desired markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets. In recent years the United States government has implemented additional duties on certain product categories across various industries. It is possible that additional duty increases could occur in future years, which could have a significant unfavorable impact on the apparel retail industry and our cost of goods sold, operations, net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment, including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products. As a result of these changes and increased costs of production in certain countries that unfavorably impact our cost of goods sold, we continue to make changes in our supply chain, including exiting certain factories and sourcing those products from a factory in a different foreign country. 
In addition, apparel and other related products sold by us are subject to stringent and complex product performance and security and safety standards, laws and other regulations. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, certification of product safety and importer security procedures. We believe that we are in material compliance with those regulations. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also generally subject to such regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations.
Important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS
We operate four distribution centers, with each operating group generally serviced by one distribution center. Our Auburn, Washington, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and Toccoa, Georgia distribution centers serve our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Lanier Apparel operating groups, respectively. Our Lyons, Georgia distribution center provides services for our smaller Southern Tide, TBBC and Duck Head businesses, as well as our Lilly Pulitzer business and certain third party customers. 
Activities at the distribution centers include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to our retail store, e-commerce and wholesale customers, each as applicable. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory at the distribution centers to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked, at-once and some in-stock replenishment orders for our wholesale customers. We use a local third party distribution center for our Tommy Bahama Australia operations.
More than 75% of our net sales in Fiscal 2020 were direct to consumer sales, which are filled on a current basis; accordingly, an order backlog is not material to our business. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
We believe that sophisticated information systems and functionality are important components of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses, particularly in the ever-changing consumer shopping environment. Our information systems are designed to provide effective retail store, e-commerce, restaurant and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point-of-sale, distribution center, design, sourcing, order processing, marketing, customer relationship management, accounting and other functions. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies, to provide additional consumer access and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business. We believe 

22



that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency, functionality and reporting capabilities is critical to our operations and financial condition.
LICENSING AGREEMENTS
We license the Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide trademarks to licensees in categories beyond our brands’ core product categories. We believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for our larger lifestyle brands. Once a brand is more fully established, licensing typically requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In evaluating a licensee for our brands, we typically consider the candidate’s experience, financial stability, sourcing expertise and marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed licensed products with our products.
Our agreements with our licensees are brand specific, relate to specific geographic areas and have expirations at various dates in the future, with contingent renewal options in limited cases. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty payments based on specified percentages of the licensee’s net sales of the licensed products as well as certain obligations for advertising and marketing. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution.
​
We license the Tommy Bahama brand for a broad range of product categories including indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, beach chairs, bedding and bath linens, fabrics, leather goods and gifts, headwear, hosiery, sleepwear, shampoo, toiletries, fragrances, cigar accessories, distilled spirits and other products. Third party license arrangements for Lilly Pulitzer products include stationery and gift products; home furnishing products; and eyewear. We currently license the Southern Tide trademark to licensees for certain bed and bath product categories. 
In addition to our license arrangements for the specific product categories listed above, we may enter into certain international distributor agreements which allow those parties to distribute apparel and other products on a wholesale and/or retail basis within certain countries or regions. As of January 30, 2021, we have agreements for the distribution of Tommy Bahama products in the Middle East and parts of Latin America. The products sold by the distributors generally are identical to the products sold in our own Tommy Bahama stores. In addition to selling Tommy Bahama goods to wholesale accounts, the distributors may, in some cases, operate their own retail stores. As of January 30, 2021, we have licensed Tommy Bahama stores located in the Middle East and Central America. None of these international distributor agreements are expected to generate growth that would materially impact our operating results in the near term.
SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS
Each of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. Typically, the demand for products for our larger brands and principal markets is higher in the spring, summer and holiday seasons and lower in the fall season (generally, the third quarter of our fiscal year). As a result, our quarterly operating results and working capital requirements fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, with the third quarter historically having the lowest net sales compared to our other quarters and incurring an operating loss. Further, the impact of the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, weather or other factors affecting our operations may vary from one year to the next. Therefore, we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2019 or Fiscal 2020 are indicative of the expected distribution in future years, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s significant impact on our Fiscal 2020 operating results. 
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Our key strategy is to own brands that make people happy, and we recognize that successful execution of our strategy starts with people. We believe treating people fairly and with respect is key to long-term success and, more importantly, is simply the right thing to do.

As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 3,900 individuals globally, more than 95% of whom were in the United States. Approximately 2,700 and 800 of these employees were dedicated to our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer businesses, respectively, while approximately 70% of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees. Our employee base fluctuates during the year, as we typically hire seasonal employees to support our retail store and restaurant operations, primarily during the holiday selling season. None of our employees as of January 30, 2021 was represented by unions.
Fiscal 2020 was a challenging year for our company, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing temporary, extended closures of all of our retail stores and restaurants in the First Half of Fiscal 2020 and significantly disrupting the retail apparel industry. Even after reopening certain of our bricks and mortar operations, due to government and health requirements and guidelines, we elected to offer only limited curbside pickup at some locations and restrict operating hours, where necessary. We also made some difficult decisions to strategically reduce our workforce to right-size our operations to preserve liquidity in the short-term but, more importantly, position ourselves to thrive in a post-pandemic retail environment. As a result, our total employee headcount declined more than 30% from the end of Fiscal 2019 to the end of Fiscal 2020.

Talent and Development
We are always looking for great people to join our team. We recognize that in order to remain competitive, we must attract, develop and retain top caliber employees in our design, marketing, merchandising, information technology and other functions, as well as in our retail stores, restaurants and distribution centers.

Our aim is greater employee engagement and ultimately a more effective organization. As part of our commitment to our people, throughout our brands and businesses, we provide employees with training, growth and development opportunities, including on-the-job training, learning and development programs, and other educational programs. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining a clean, safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees. In the interest of the health and safety of our employees, we made the preemptive decision prior to government mandate to close all of our retail store and restaurant operations in North America starting on March 17, 2020. For our distribution

Among our management employees, who comprise approximately 20% of our workforce, the self-disclosed figures were 33% male, 67% female and less than 1% undisclosed or choosing not to identify. As of January 30, 2021, in the United States, which is the only jurisdiction in which our employees self-disclose ethnicity, the self-disclosed ethnicity of our workforce was 62% white (not Hispanic or Latino) and 38% non-white, whereas for management employees in the United States, the self-disclosed ethnicity figures were 78% white (not Hispanic or Latino) and 22% non-white. 
We make a concerted effort to encourage the exchange of ideas and to actively listen to employee dialogue, provide appropriate training and ensure that the interests of all our employees are supported and advanced. We hope to maintain an environment where there is a sense of belonging and all voices are heard and valued.
