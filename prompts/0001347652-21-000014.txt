ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. ("CorEnergy") was organized as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations on December 8, 2005. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Report"), the terms "we", "us", "our" and the "Company" refer to CorEnergy and its subsidiaries.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We are a publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on energy infrastructure. Our business strategy is to own and operate or lease critical energy midstream infrastructure connecting the upstream and downstream sectors within the industry. We currently generate revenue from the transportation, via pipeline, of natural gas and crude oil for our customers in Missouri and California. The pipelines are located in areas where it would be difficult to replicate rights of way or transport natural gas or crude oil via non-pipeline alternatives resulting in our assets providing utility-like criticality in the midstream supply chain for our customers. 
As primarily regulated assets, the near to medium term value of our regulated pipelines is supported by revenue derived from cost-of-service methodology. The cost-of-service methodology is used to establish appropriate transportation rates based on several factors including expected volumes, expenses, debt and return on equity. The regulated nature of the majority of our assets provides a degree of support for our profitability over the long-term, where our customers primarily own the products shipped on or stored in our facilities. We believe these characteristics provide CorEnergy with the attractive attributes of other globally listed infrastructure companies, including high barriers to entry and predictable revenue streams, while mitigating risks and volatility experienced by other companies engaged in the midstream energy sector.
Over the last twelve months, our asset portfolio has undergone significant changes as described under "2020 Developments" below. We have divested all of our leased assets including the Grand Isle Gathering System ("GIGS") and Pinedale Liquids Gathering System ("Pinedale LGS"). On February 4, 2021, GIGS was used as partial consideration to acquire a 49.50 percent interest in Crimson Midstream Holdings, LLC ("Crimson"), an approximately 2,000-mile crude oil transportation pipeline system in California, which is referred to throughout this Report as the "Crimson Transaction." The repositioning of our asset portfolio from a focus on non-operated leased assets to one of owned and operated assets is enabled by our U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") recent private letter ruling ("PLR") related to qualifying income for operated assets. As a result, all of our current assets are owned and operated which provides us with an opportunity to grow the business organically using our footprint in addition to making acquisitions. However, we still plan on pursuing the leasing or other non-operating ownership of assets, as part of our business model, when we believe appropriate opportunities arise. We intend to distribute substantially all of our cash available for distribution, less prudent reserves, on a quarterly basis. We regularly assess our ability to pay and to grow our dividend to common stockholders. 
2020 Developments 
Our 2020 fiscal year was impacted by the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic-related reduction in energy demand, which resulted in several significant impacts on our tenants under our then triple-net leases and the financial performance of our business. These key events during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 are summarized below:
•The COVID-19 pandemic-related reduction in energy demand and the uncertainty of production from OPEC members, U.S. producers and other international suppliers caused significant disruptions and volatility in the global oil marketplace during 2020, which adversely affected our tenants. In response to COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented increasingly stringent measures to help reduce the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, travel restrictions and other measures. These measures have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the U.S. and many other countries, resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted global demand and prices for the products handled by our pipelines, terminals and other facilities. There is significant uncertainty regarding how long these conditions will persist and the impact of the virus on the energy industry and potential impacts to our business. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further details. 
•Events as described above resulted in decreases of current and expected long-term crude oil prices along with significant reductions to the market capitalization and bankruptcy filings of many oil and gas producing companies, including our tenants. Our tenant under the Grand Isle Lease Agreement was impacted by these economic events and ceased paying rent starting on April 1, 2020 and continuing into January of 2021, until the GIGS asset was disposed of and the Grand Isle Lease Agreement was terminated on February 4, 2021 in connection with the Crimson Transaction described above. These events triggered our review of the carrying value of our long-lived GIGS asset as of March 31, 2020. Our evaluation resulted in the recognition of a $140.3 million impairment for our GIGS asset and a $30.1 million non-cash 

Glossary of Defined Terms

write-off of the deferred rent receivable for the Grand Isle Lease Agreement. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 ("Leased Properties And Leases") for further details. 
•As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Ultra Petroleum Corp. ("UPL") and Ultra Wyoming LGS, LLC ("Ultra Wyoming"), the guarantor and tenant (respectively) of the Pinedale Lease Agreement, the tenant's motion to reject the lease effective June 30, 2020 and the sale of the Pinedale LGS to Ultra Wyoming for $18.0 million on June 30, 2020, (collectively, the "Pinedale Transaction"), we recognized a loss of approximately $136.0 million, net of a gain on extinguishment of related debt, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Pinedale Lease Agreement was terminated effective June 30, 2020. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 3 ("Leased Properties And Leases") for further details. 
Our Operations 
As highlighted above, we have significantly changed our asset portfolio during 2020 and first quarter 2021. The asset portfolio is described below.
Crimson Midstream Holdings: An approximately 2,000-mile crude oil transportation pipeline system, including approximately 1,300 active miles, and associated storage facilities located in southern California and the San Joaquin Valley. The pipeline network provides a critical link between California crude oil production and California refineries. The operations and maintenance of these assets are in strict accordance with applicable safety and regulatory requirements promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation's ("DOT") Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") and California State Fire Marshall. The California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC") regulates the rates and administration of the transportation tariffs which comprise the majority of our revenue generating activities. These assets were acquired effective as of February 1, 2021.
MoGas Pipeline System: An approximate 263-mile interstate natural gas pipeline in and around St. Louis and extending into central Missouri. The pipeline network provides a critical link between natural gas producing regions with local utilities. MoGas operates and maintains these assets in strict accordance with applicable safety and regulatory requirements promulgated by PHMSA. The vast majority of our revenue is related to our Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC")-approved firm transportation agreements with various customers which entitle the customers to specified amounts of guaranteed capacity on the pipeline during the term of the agreements. We also earn additional revenue from our customers based on actual volumes of natural gas transported under either the firm transportation agreements, or under interruptible transportation agreements, but these revenues comprise a small percentage of our total revenue.
Omega Pipeline: An approximate 75-mile natural gas distribution system located primarily on the U.S. Army's Fort Leonard Wood military post in south-central Missouri. Omega Pipeline Company, LLC ("Omega") operates and maintains these assets in strict accordance with applicable safety and regulatory requirements promulgated by the Missouri Public Service Commission ("MoPUC"). The vast majority of Omega’s revenue is derived from a non-regulated Natural Gas Distribution Agreement between Omega and the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD"), to provide the natural gas supply, distribution assets, operations and maintenance of the assets at Fort Leonard Wood. Omega has been under contract with the DOD since 1991 at Fort Leonard Wood, and we are currently in year five of a ten-year renewable agreement. We also earn additional revenue from Omega Gas Marketing, LLC providing gas supply services to a small number of small industrial and commercial customers in central Missouri near Fort Leonard Wood, but these revenues comprise a minimal percentage of our total revenue.
On November 16, 2018, the IRS issued a second requested PLR to CorEnergy. The PLR provides us assurance that fees we may receive for the usage of storage and pipeline assets we may own will qualify as rents from real property for purposes of our qualification as a REIT. As a result, the PLR grants us the opportunity to own and operate certain energy infrastructure assets under conditions set forth in the PLR. This ruling allows us to own and operate assets such as those within Crimson, MoGas, and Omega, which, prior to this PLR ruling, would not have directly generated REIT qualifying income.
Assets sold during 2020 and Q1 2021:
Grand Isle Gathering System: An approximately 137-mile subsea crude oil pipeline system located in the Gulf of Mexico south of Grand Isle, Louisiana and a 16-acre onshore terminal facility located in Grand Isle, Louisiana. CorEnergy had a triple-net lease for these assets on a long-term basis to a subsidiary of Energy Gulf Coast, Inc. ("EGC"), pursuant to the Grand Isle Lease Agreement. On February 4, 2021, the Grand Isle Gathering System was provided as partial consideration for the purchase of the 49.50 percent interest in Crimson.
Pinedale LGS: An approximately 150-mile liquid pipeline system and four central gathering treatment facilities located in the Pinedale Anticline, near Pinedale, Wyoming. CorEnergy had a triple-net lease for these assets on a long-term basis to a subsidiary of UPL. The Pinedale LGS was sold to UPL on June 30, 2020.

Market Overview 
Crude oil production in California dates back more than 150 years and the state has some of the highest recoverable reserves remaining in the ground. Given the significant hydrocarbon resources in California, and its access to the Pacific Ocean, California is not connected, via pipeline, to other crude oil producing regions in North America. The refining industry in California is primarily supplied first by native California crude oil production with the balance being supplied via waterborne imports. The majority of refineries in California are specifically designed to service California from both a crude oil supply and refined products standpoint. Many refineries are specifically designed to process the low-gravity crude oil that is prevalent in California. Furthermore, the refineries are also uniquely designed to meet the stringent California gasoline standards set by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB"). The high complexity of CARB requirements for California refiners results in a preference for California produced crude oil as a feedstock. Furthermore, the stringent refined product formulations required by CARB provide high barriers to entry for satisfying California's refined product demand from refineries outside of California.
The utilization of MoGas and Omega assets is driven by the consumption of natural gas from residential, commercial and industrial users in the region where MoGas' and Omega's assets are located. MoGas is well supplied by other interstate pipelines, originating in the Rocky Mountains, Mid-Continent, Appalachia, and Gulf Coast production basins.
Competition 
We compete with other midstream energy companies as well as public and private funds, to make the types of investments that we plan to make in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to a greater variety of funding sources than are available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. These competitive conditions may adversely affect our ability to make investments in the energy infrastructure sector and could adversely affect our distributions to stockholders.
Pipelines generally offer the lowest cost and safest mode of transportation. Despite this, pipelines can face competition from other forms of transportation, such as truck, rail and ship. Although these alternative forms of transportation are typically higher cost, they can provide access to alternative markets which could be attractive to our customers for various reasons.
The primary competition for our California assets is existing pipelines and trucking. In mature and stable crude oil producing regions like California, the threat of a newly constructed pipelines is low. Furthermore, a significant percentage of our assets are located in an urban environment which also significantly decreases the competition from new construction. 
Customers 
The majority of revenues from Crimson's operations are generated from California refiners which are predominately investment-grade. The majority of revenues from our MoGas and Omega operations are generated from long-term "take-or-pay" contracts with investment grade utilities, municipalities and the DOD. For a discussion of customers, see Part IV, Item 15, Note 8 ("Concentrations") to our consolidated financial statements. 
Growth Opportunities and Due Diligence
We seek to grow through acquisitions and organically via optimization of our existing assets. We primarily rely on our own analysis to determine whether to pursue an opportunity. In evaluating a specific opportunity, we consider, among other things, the following factors:
•Cash Flow Stability – We primary seek growth opportunities which provide stable and predictable cash flow through either long-term contracts or a regulated cost-of-service. As a second layer of stability, we look for assets which have natural barriers to entry with low current competition.
•Importance to Customer/Counterparty Operations – We predominately focus on assets that we believe are critical or important to the ongoing operations of the customer or counterparty for the economic production or use of hydrocarbon resources. We focus on assets which are critical to our customers' realization of economic returns from their operations. We believe that this type of asset will provide a relatively low risk of nonuse, and therefore loss, in the case of a potential bankruptcy or abandonment scenario.
•Organic Growth/Optimization Opportunities – We seek assets which provide us with the opportunity to organically grow. These opportunities might include attracting new volumes to our system or optimizing the asset within our current portfolio.

Glossary of Defined Terms

•Diversification – We attempt to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular customer, counterparty, commodity, and market location within the U.S. By diversifying, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular asset, commodity, or market region.
•Asset Evaluation – We review the physical condition of the property and assess the effectiveness of the current integrity management program. We also typically engage a third party to conduct, or require the seller to conduct, a thorough examination of all land-related documents, agreements, and easements, as well as, a preliminary examination, or Phase 1 assessment, of the site to determine the potential for contamination or similar environmental site assessments in an attempt to identify potential environmental liabilities associated with a property prior to its acquisition.
•Customer/Counterparty/Investment Evaluation – We evaluate each potential customer, counterparty or investment for creditworthiness, typically considering factors such as management experience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure, as well as other factors that may be relevant to a particular acquisition. 
•Lease Terms – Typically, the net leased properties we will acquire will be leased on a full recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, we often seek to include a clause in each lease that provides for increases in rent over the term of the lease.
•Other Real Estate Related Assets – As other opportunities arise, we may also seek to expand the portfolio to include other types of real estate-related investments, in all cases within the energy infrastructure sector, such as: 
◦equity investments in real properties that are not long-term net leased to a single-tenant and may include partially leased properties, undeveloped properties and properties subject to short-term net leases, among others;
◦mortgage loans secured by real properties including loans to our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS");
◦subordinated interests in first mortgage real estate loans, or B-notes;
◦mezzanine loans related to real estate, which are senior to the borrower's equity position but subordinated to other third-party financing; and
◦equity and debt securities (including preferred equity, limited partnership interests, trusts and other higher yielding structured debt and equity investments) issued by companies that are engaged in real-estate-related businesses as defined by regulations promulgated under the Code or our PLR, including other REITs.
Use of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries
We operate as a REIT and therefore are generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on the income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived through leasing fees and financing revenue from our REIT qualifying investments in energy infrastructure assets. However, even as a REIT, we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our TRSs. The use of TRSs enables us to own certain assets and engage in certain businesses while maintaining compliance with the REIT qualification requirements under the Code. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries. For example, through a series of reorganization events, and based on a favorable IRS PLR received, Omega was converted from a TRS entity to a qualified REIT subsidiary in 2017. Refer to the "Omega Pipeline (Mowood, LLC)" section in Item 2 of this Report for additional details.
Financing Strategy 
We believe a major factor in our continued success is our ability to maintain financial flexibility, a competitive cost of capital and access to the capital markets. Our long-term target is a total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of less than 4.0x. However, we may exceed that target during an acquisition if there is a viable path to returning to the long-term target. In addition to debt, we may use preferred or common equity to satisfy remaining capital needs to help limit the amount of financial risk of the Company.
Consistent with our asset acquisition policies, we use leverage when available on terms we believe are favorable. The amount of leverage for any given acquisition will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Although we currently do not anticipate doing so, the amount of total funded debt leverage we employ may exceed 50 percent of our total assets. Secured loans which we might obtain, could be recourse or non-recourse to us. A lender on non-recourse mortgage debt often has recourse only to the property collateralizing such debt and not to any of our other assets, while full recourse financing would give the lender recourse to all of our assets. The use of non-recourse debt helps us to limit the exposure of all of our assets to any one debt obligation.

Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our energy infrastructure assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of public health and safety, zoning and land use, and pricing and other matters related to certain of our business operations. For a discussion of the current effects and potential future impacts of such regulations on our business and properties, see the discussion presented in Item 1A of this Report under the subheading "Risks Related to Our Investments in Energy Infrastructure." In particular, for a discussion of the current and potential future effects of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, see the discussion titled "Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for distribution to our stockholders" within such section.
FERC and State PUC Common Carrier Regulations
The vast majority of our operated pipeline systems are subject to economic and operational regulation by various federal, state and/or local agencies. Our rates are generally set based on a regulated cost-of-service model.
FERC regulates interstate transportation on our common carrier pipeline systems under the Interstate Commerce Act ("ICA"), the Natural Gas Act, the Environmental Protection Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC's regulations also require interstate common carrier pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service.
Under the ICA, FERC or any interested private entity of person may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for a period of time or could limit a common carrier pipeline's ability to change rates until completion of an investigation. During an investigation, FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful.
Intrastate transportation services, provided by our California pipeline system, are subject to regulation by the CPUC. The CPUC requires intrastate pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates and proposed rate increases. The CPUC could limit our ability to increase our rates or could order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation 
Our operations involve the transportation of crude oil and natural gas which are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, and the addition of new operational constraints. Environmental and safety laws and regulations are subject to changes that may result in more stringent requirements which could negatively impact our future earnings to the extent they cannot be recovered through our cost-of-service framework. A discharge of hazardous liquids into the environment could, to the extent such event is not insured, subject us to substantial expense. The following summarizes some of the key environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Pipeline and Tank Safety and Integrity Management
The majority of our assets are subject to regulation by the DOT's PHMSA pursuant to the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 ("HLPSA"). The HLPSA imposes safety requirements on the design, construction, operation and maintenance of pipeline and storage facilities. Federal regulations implementing the HLPSA require pipeline operators to adopt measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of their operations, including the maintenance of comprehensive spill response plans and the performance of spill response training for pipeline personnel. These regulations also require pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities. 
The HLPSA was amended by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. These amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules by the DOT that requires transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to ensure pipeline safety in "high consequence areas" such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and navigable waterways.
In October 2015, the Governor of California signed the Oil Spill Response: Environmentally and Ecologically Sensitive Areas Bill ("AB-864") which requires new and existing pipelines located near environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas connected to or located in the coastal zone to use best available technologies to reduce the amount of oil released in an oil spill to protect state waters and wildlife. The California Office of the State Fire Marshal has developed the regulations required by 

Glossary of Defined Terms

AB-864. Full compliance is required by early 2023. Compliance with these new regulations may require some modifications to our affected pipelines in California and may add to the cost to operate the pipelines subject to these rules.
The DOT has generally adopted American Petroleum Institute Standard ("API") 653 as the standard for the maintenance of steel above ground petroleum storage tanks subject to DOT jurisdiction. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of tanks remaining in service.
Occupational Safety and Health
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Seasonality 
Our operated pipeline volumes have not historically experienced meaningful seasonal revenue variability. Our MoGas and Omega assets can experience high volumes in times of extreme high or low temperatures but impacts to our revenue are limited given the contracts. Our San Pablo Bay pipeline has a minimum flow rate requirement, which is dependent on ground temperature, in order to maintain segregated crude-oil service.
MANAGEMENT
Our Manager
We are externally managed by Corridor. Corridor is a real property asset manager with a focus on U.S. energy infrastructure real property assets. Corridor assists us in identifying infrastructure real property asset acquisition opportunities, and is generally responsible for our day-to-day operations. 
On February 4, 2021, we entered into a Contribution Agreement with Richard C. Green, Rick Kreul, Rebecca M. Sandring, Sean DeGon, Jeff Teeven, Jeffrey E. Fulmer, David J. Schulte (as Trustee of the DJS Trust under Trust Agreement dated July 18, 2016), and Campbell Hamilton, Inc., which is an entity controlled by David J. Schulte (collectively, the "Contributors"), and Corridor. Consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Contribution Agreement will result in the internalization of the management of the Company (the "Internalization"). Following the Internalization, we will own all material assets of Corridor currently used in the conduct of its business and will be managed by officers and employees who currently work for Corridor and who are expected to become employees of the Company as a result of the Internalization. We will seek stockholder approval of the Internalization in compliance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 16 ("Subsequent Events") for further details on the Internalization. 
Contemporaneously with execution of the Contribution Agreement, we and Corridor entered into the First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Management Agreement dated as of May 8, 2015 (as amended, the "Management Agreement") that has the effect of (i) reducing the amount paid to Corridor until closing of the Internalization or termination of the Contribution Agreement and (ii) provides payment to Corridor to enable distribution of payments to employees of Corridor as approved by the independent directors of the Company and pending closing of the Contribution Agreement. The following description of Corridor is based on the current operations of our manager prior to the completion of the Internalization, except as otherwise noted. 
Management Team
Each of our officers, except officers recently appointed from Crimson in February 2021, is an employee of Corridor or one of its affiliates. The CorEnergy officers directly employed by Crimson include John Grier, Larry Alexander and Robert Waldron. Corridor is not obligated to dedicate certain of its employees exclusively to us, nor are it or its employees obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to our business. As described below, we have historically paid a management fee and certain other fees to Corridor, which it used in part to pay compensation to certain officers and employees who, notwithstanding that some of them also are our officers, receive no cash compensation directly from us.
Prior to the announcement of the Internalization agreement on February 4, 2021, we paid Corridor a management fee based on total assets under management. Additionally, Corridor was paid an incentive fee based on increases in distributions to our stockholders. A percentage of the Corridor incentive fee was reinvested in CorEnergy's common stock. Pursuant to the Management Agreement and Administrative Agreement, Corridor agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to present us with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment objectives and policies and is generally responsible, subject to the supervision and review of our Board of Directors, for our day-to-day operations.

Energy Infrastructure Real Property Asset Management and Operation
Both the historical members of the Corridor team and the new officers from the Crimson team have experience across several segments of the energy sector and will continue to be primarily responsible for the effective management of our assets to maintain and enhance their values. The PLR creates the opportunity for us to acquire and operate assets in the manner we now do for Crimson, MoGas and Mowood, but on a broader scale. We have leveraged the PLR in acquiring the Crimson assets described above, and we will continue to rely on Corridor and Crimson to provide or supervise the employees responsible for operating such assets until the Internalization is complete. 
Management Agreement
Under our Management Agreement, pending Internalization, Corridor (i) presents us with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment policies and our objectives, (ii) is responsible for our day-to-day operations and (iii) performs such services and activities relating to our assets and operations as may be appropriate. The Management Agreement does not have a specific term, and will remain in place unless terminated by us or Corridor in the manner permitted pursuant to the agreement, which includes the Internalization transaction described above. 
As historically in effect, the terms of the Management Agreement include a quarterly management fee equal to 0.25 percent (1.00 percent annualized) of the value of our Managed Assets as of the end of each quarter. For purposes of the Management Agreement, "Managed Assets" means our total assets (including any securities receivables, other personal property or real property purchased with or attributable to any borrowed funds) minus (A) the initial invested value of all non-controlling interests, (B) the value of any hedged derivative assets, (C) any prepaid expenses and (D) all of the accrued liabilities other than (1) deferred taxes and (2) debt entered into for the purpose of leverage. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, our securities portfolio will be valued at then-current market value. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, other personal property and real property assets will include real and other personal property owned and our assets invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate or personal property (including acquisition-related costs and acquisition costs that may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), valued at the aggregate historical cost, before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar noncash reserves.
During 2020, prior to the amendment of the Management Agreement in connection with the Internalization, Corridor voluntarily recommended, and we agreed, that effective solely for the purpose of computing the Managed Assets in calculating the quarterly management fee under the terms of the Management Agreement certain cash balances should be excluded from Managed Assets.
Corridor also voluntarily recommended, and we agreed, that effective solely for purpose of computing the Managed Assets in calculating the quarterly management fee under the terms of the Management Agreement for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the incremental management fee attributable to the assets involved in the Pinedale Transaction, which occurred on June 30, 2020, should be paid for the second quarter of 2020 as such assets were under management for all but the last day of the period.
The Management Agreement also required a quarterly incentive fee of 10 percent of the increase in distributions paid over a threshold distribution equal to $0.625 per share per quarter. During 2020, the Company either waived or did not earn the incentive fee that would otherwise be payable under the provisions of the Management Agreement with respect to dividends paid on the Company's common stock. Accordingly, Corridor did not receive any incentive fees during 2020. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 9 ("Management Agreement") for further details on the Management Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Until the closing of the Internalization transaction or termination of the Contribution Agreement as described above, we will pay Corridor a management fee based on the actual cost of operations of Corridor, including salaries and benefits of employees. 
Administrative Agreement
Under our Administrative Agreement, Corridor, as our administrator, performs (or oversees or arranges for the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including without limitation providing us with equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. For these services we pay our administrator an annual fee equal to 0.04 percent of the value of the Company's Managed Assets as of the end of each quarter, with a minimum annual fee of $30 thousand.
Pursuant to the Management and Administrative Agreement, Corridor furnishes us with office facilities and clerical and administrative services necessary for our operation (other than services provided by our custodian, accounting agent, dividend and interest-paying agents and other service providers). Corridor is authorized to enter into agreements with third parties to provide such services. To the extent we request, Corridor will (i) oversee the performance and payment of the fees of our service providers and make such reports and recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning such matters as the parties deem desirable; (ii) respond to inquiries and otherwise assist such service providers in the preparation and filing of regulatory reports, proxy statements, and stockholder communications, and the preparation of materials and reports for the Board of Directors; (iii) establish and oversee the implementation of borrowing facilities or other forms of leverage authorized by the Board of 

Glossary of Defined Terms

Directors; and (iv) supervise any other aspect of our administration as may be agreed upon by us and Corridor. We have agreed, pursuant to the Management Agreement, to reimburse Corridor for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the foregoing.
We bear all expenses not specifically assumed by Corridor and incurred in our operations. The compensation and allocable routine overhead expenses of all management professionals of Corridor and its staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing us management services, is provided and paid for by Corridor and not us.
Human Capital Management
As we are externally managed, we have no employees at the corporate level. Our subsidiary, Omega, has one part-time and three full-time employees. Our subsidiary MoGas has one part-time employee and 16 full-time employees. Corridor has 12 employees who will become direct employees of CorEnergy upon closing of the Internalization described above. 
Corridor's and our subsidiaries' employees are an important asset, and we seek to attract and retain top talent by fostering a culture that is guided by our core values of integrity, inclusivity, creativity and high standards of quality and excellence. We also seek to promote workplace and operational safety and focus on the protection of public health and the environment.
As of February 4, 2021, we acquired a 49.50 percent interest in Crimson, which has 105 full-time equivalent employees.
