 Item 1. Business 
 Introduction 
 
General
 We are one of the world’s leading manufacturers and designers of firearms. We manufacture a wide array of handguns (including revolvers and pistols), long guns (including modern sporting rifles, bolt action rifles, and muzzleloaders), handcuffs, suppressors, and other firearm-related products for sale to a wide variety of customers, including firearm enthusiasts, collectors, hunters, sportsmen, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and security agencies and officers, and military agencies in the United States and throughout the world. We sell our products under the Smith & Wesson, M&P, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands. We manufacture our products at our facilities in Springfield, Massachusetts, Houlton, Maine, and Deep River, Connecticut. We store finished good inventory and fulfill customer orders from our distribution center in Columbia, Missouri. We also sell our manufacturing services to other businesses to level-load our factories. We sell those services under our Smith & Wesson and Smith & Wesson Precision Components brands. 
 
Smith & Wesson was founded in 1852 by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. Mr. Wesson purchased Mr. Smith’s interest in 1873. The Wesson family sold Smith & Wesson Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, to Bangor Punta Corp. in 1965. Lear Siegler Corporation purchased Bangor Punta in 1984, thereby acquiring ownership of Smith & Wesson Corp. Forstmann Little & Co. purchased Lear Siegler in 1986 and sold Smith & Wesson Corp. shortly thereafter to Tomkins Corporation, an affiliate of U.K.-based Tomkins PLC. We purchased Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins in May 2001 and renamed our company Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation. In January 2017, we changed the name of our company from Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. In May 2020, in preparation for the spin-off of our outdoor products and accessories business, or the Separation, which was completed on August 24, 2020, we changed our name to Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion below, including amounts and percentages for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial condition from continuing operations. As such, our former outdoor products and accessories business is reported as discontinued operations and has been excluded. 
 We maintain our principal executive offices at 2100 Roosevelt Avenue, Springfield, Massachusetts 01104. Our telephone number is (800) 331-0852. Our website is located at www.smith-wesson.com. Through our website, we make available free of charge our annual reports on Form 10-K, our proxy statements, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of these documents filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These documents are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We also post on our website the charters of our Audit, Compensation, and Nominations and Corporate Governance Committees; our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Conduct, and any amendments or waivers thereto; and any other corporate governance materials contemplated by the regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market. These documents are also available in print by contacting our corporate secretary at our executive offices. 
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” and “our company” refer to Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. “Common stock” refers to the common stock, par value $.001 per share, of our company. Our fiscal year ended on April 30, 2021.

 We estimate that the annual domestic non-military firearm market based on industry shipments is approximately $2.9 billion for handguns and $1.5 billion for long guns, excluding shotguns, with our market share, based on the latest data provided by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, or NSSF, utilizing Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax data for calendar year 2020, being approximately 21.2% and 15.0%, respectively. According to 2019 reports by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the U.S. firearm manufacturing industry has shown a minimal annual decline in firearms manufactured between 2014 and 2019 in spite of individual years in which units manufactured have grown as much as 23.0% in one year. The data from the ATF lags by one year from the NSSF data, and we expect a significant increase to be reported by the ATF once calendar year 2020 data is published in late 2021.
 Strategy
Our objective is to be the undisputed market leader in the firearm industry. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are as follows:
 Drive Organic Growth by Leveraging Brands and Designing Innovative New Products
 
We are focused on driving organic growth by ensuring a robust new product pipeline and leveraging our brands to help us to increase market share in markets in which we participate and to expand into adjacent and complementary markets by (1) capitalizing on the goodwill developed through our historic 169 year old “Smith & Wesson” brand as well as our extensive portfolio of other well-known brands, such as M&P and Gemtech; (2) enhancing our relationships with key retailers, distributors, and buying groups and using our standard margin advantage to engage in competitive promotional activities; and (3) introducing new products, especially in the polymer handgun market as represented by our M&P brand. During the last two fiscal years, we have introduced numerous new products, including variations and product lines around the Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Gemtech, brands. We plan to continue to introduce new products in fiscal 2022.
Design, Produce, and Market High-Quality Products that Drive Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty 
 We are focused on designing, producing, and marketing high-quality, innovative firearms and related accessories that meet the needs and desires of our consumer and professional customers and that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.  Our ongoing research and development, product engineering, product sourcing, marketing, and distribution activities are critical components of our ability to offer successful products. We believe that by offering high-quality products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as providing world-class customer service, training, and support, we will drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.  We regard our high-quality, innovative products as the most important aspect of our customer satisfaction and loyalty, but we also offer customer service and support with various programs, such as toll-free customer support numbers, e-mail customer question and answer communications, broad service policies, and product warranties.Create a Leverageable Infrastructure by Streamlining and Standardizing our Business Operations, including Optimizing Product Distribution 
 
We intend to continue to streamline and standardize certain administrative functions of our business with a goal toward driving profitability and improving the ease with which our customers are able to do business with us. A 
 2


streamlined and standardized approach requires investing in an integrated and configurable technology infrastructure in areas such as enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and compliance. We intend to continue investing in such systems to further enhance our efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls.
 Deploy our Cash Flow in Such a Manner so as to Maximize Return on Invested Capital  
 
During fiscal 2021, we generated $317.3 million in cash from continuing operations. We utilized this cash to repay all of our existing debt, invest in equipment to increase our capacity and improve our efficiency, declare and pay the first ever dividend in our history, and repurchase $110 million of our outstanding stock. We intend to continue our focus on developing, growing, and protecting our iconic firearm brands and using our cash flow from operations on actions that will maximize our return on invested capital, including continuing to invest as needed in organic growth, especially in machinery, equipment, and new product development and returning excess capital to our stockholders. 
 Products  
 
Introduction
 Our products combine our legacy of 169 years of American manufacturing and engineering expertise with modern technological advances. Driven by the needs of the individual firearm owner, we continually strive to improve the experience of buying, owning, and shooting a firearm. We also strive to leverage our tradition of innovation in materials, performance, and engineering, along with our proven history of reliability, to produce feature-rich, safe, durable, accurate, and high-performing firearms that satisfy the needs of our broad range of customers. Our introduction of new products is intended to enhance our competitive position and broaden our participation in the overall market. 
 We have substantially enhanced the breadth and quality of our portfolio of products over the years. We have always been a leader in the revolver market. The introduction of our popular M&P branded pistol in January 2005 resulted in our company becoming one of the leaders in the polymer pistol market as well, serving both the consumer sporting goods market and law enforcement agencies. The launch of our M&P branded modern sporting rifle in January 2006 has enabled us to capture what we estimate is the leading share of the modern sporting rifle market. The addition of our Thompson/Center Arms brand of hunting firearms and interchangeable firearm systems into our product portfolio in January 2007 enhanced our long gun barrel manufacturing capabilities for our modern sporting rifles. Although we recently announced our plan to divest our Thompson/Center Arms brand, we intend to focus on the hunting and long-range shooting market under our iconic Smith & Wesson brand. The addition of our Gemtech branded suppressor products in August 2017 expanded our firearm-related product offerings. Our suppressors are compatible with most pistols and rifles on the market and complement our firearm products. We currently participate in three categories of the long gun market: bolt action rifles, muzzleloaders, and modern sporting rifles; and both core categories of the handgun market: semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.
 All of our firearms and firearm related products are currently sold under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands. Our customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; retailers; and consumers. 
 Our product development strategy is to understand our customers’ needs and preferences and then design and develop products to uniquely meet those requirements. Throughout this process, we test multiple concepts with firearm owners and potential purchasers. We compare these test results against a growing database of prior concepts to identify those with the greatest market potential. Additional market research is completed to optimize the desired features and benefits. While this development process is ongoing, our launch timing for new products depends on market conditions to maximize sales across the entire product portfolio.

In fiscal 2021, we introduced several additions and enhancements to our popular line of M&P branded pistols, most notably the high capacity, micro-compact M&P Shield Plus. Designed for concealed carry, the M&P Shield Plus is the most advanced M&P Shield pistol to date, featuring a magazine of up to 13 rounds in a slim, micro-compact frame. The M&P Shield Plus is available in 9mm and in a variety of configurations, including Performance Center® models with optics cuts, upgraded sights, and other features.  We also expanded the line of M&P M2.0 Compact pistols to include an optics-ready variant. Building on the award-winning M&P M2.0 Compact pistol series, the new models are chambered in 9mm and feature a slide cut for optics, co-witness white-dot front and rear sights, and enlarged forward slide serrations.  
 
Our customers continue to demand premium firearms that provide a competitive edge in sport shooting and hunting. Our Performance Center products are engineered and manufactured to meet this need and they incorporate many custom features not found in our standard products, such as enhanced triggers for smoother trigger pull, ported barrels for better muzzle control, and specialty sights for quicker target acquisition.  During fiscal 2021, we introduced the Performance Center M&P Shield EZ pistols. Building on the popular M&P Shield EZ pistol, the new Performance Center models share the same easy-to-use features found across the entire M&P Shield EZ series and are further enhanced with premium Performance Center features.  The Performance Center M&P Shield EZ pistols are available with black, silver, and gold accents and include a ported barrel, flat face trigger, a tuned action, as well as other features.
 Within our Gemtech line of suppressors, we introduced the Integra 15-22 suppressor, an integrally-suppressed upper receiver designed for .22 LR.  Built for use exclusively with Smith & Wesson’s M&P15-22 rifle, the Gemtech Integra 15-22 ships as a complete upper receiver group that offers an exceptionally quiet shooting experience in a compact package. 
 Our net sales from continuing operations were $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021; $529.6 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020; and $481.3 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019. Our gross profit from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 totaled $449.0 million, $165.7 million, and $146.3 million, respectively. Total assets from continuing operations as of April 30, 2021 and 2020 were $446.4 million and $486.4 million, respectively.
 Handguns 
 We currently manufacture an extensive variety of handgun models that includes revolvers and pistols. A revolver is a handgun with a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of rotating chambers that are successively aligned with the barrel of the firearm during each firing cycle. There are two general types of revolvers: single-action and double-action. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the firearm and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder as it cocks and releases the hammer. A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. The firing cycle ejects the spent casings and loads a new round into the chamber. 
 We have long been known as an innovator and leader in the revolver market, and most of our revolvers are currently marketed under the Smith & Wesson brand. We sell a wide range of sizes from small-frame revolvers used primarily for concealed carry and personal protection, to large-frame revolvers used primarily for recreational and competitive sport shooting. Our extra-large frame revolvers primarily address the handgun-hunting market. 
 Our small-frame revolvers have been carried by law enforcement personnel and personal defense-minded citizens for 169 years. We hold a number of patents on various firearm applications, including the use of scandium, a material that possesses many of the same attributes as titanium but at a more reasonable cost. Our revolvers are available in a variety of models and calibers, with applications in virtually all professional and consumer markets. 
 We offer pistols under our Smith & Wesson and M&P brands. Our full size and compact M&P pistol products have been engineered with input from professional users and are designed to offer performance, safety, and durability that meet the standards of global law enforcement and military personnel, as well as features attractive to consumers. We believe that our M&P branded pistol products are the most ergonomic, feature-rich, and innovative products on the market today. Our range of full size and compact M&P pistol products are made with a polymer 
 4


frame, a rigid stainless-steel chassis, and a black, through-hardened corrosion resistant finished stainless-steel barrel and slide for durability. Our M&P pistol products feature patented and easily changed palmswell grips in four sizes, allowing the user to customize grips in a matter of seconds; a passive trigger safety to prevent the pistol from firing if dropped; an enlarged trigger guard to accommodate gloved hands; a sear lever release that eliminates the need to press the trigger in order to disassemble the firearm; an ambidextrous slide stop and reversible magazine release to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters; an optional internal locking system and magazine safety; and a universal equipment rail to allow the addition of accessories, including lights and lasers. 
 In fiscal 2012, we launched the M&P Shield pistol to address the growing personal protection and concealed carry market. The M&P Shield features a slim concealable profile, 9mm, 380 Auto, 40 S&W, and 45 Auto calibers, and M&P ergonomics. We introduced additional M&P Shield models during fiscal 2020. We believe the M&P Shield pistol is one of the most popular firearms in the market, having shipped nearly five million units as of April 30, 2021. 
 Our Performance Center has been providing specialized products and services for the most demanding shooting sports enthusiasts since 1990. To meet the requirements of law enforcement professionals, competitive shooters, collectors, and discriminating sport enthusiasts who demand superior products, our Performance Center personnel conceptualize, engineer, and craft products to create enhanced versions of our standard products. Our craftsmen, many of whom are actively involved in competitive shooting, are highly skilled and experienced gunsmiths. Performance Center products are offered under the Smith & Wesson and M&P brands and are typically made in limited production quantities, although we offer a number of catalog variations in order to increase product availability. 
 Our “Classics” department makes it possible to own historic firearms that are manufactured today but modeled after original favorites, such as the Model 29, the firearm made famous by the movie character Dirty Harry. These firearms are newly crafted with designs that take advantage of some of the most famous and collectible firearms that we have ever made. Our Classics department also makes commemorative firearms and employs master engravers to craft one-of-a-kind custom firearms. These custom-made applications reflect the skill and vision of the master engraver and the artistic expression of the owner. We offer a number of catalog variations of Classics and engraved Classics to our customers. 
 Long Guns 
 Our M&P branded modern sporting rifles are designed to satisfy the functionality and reliability needs of global military, law enforcement, and security personnel. These long guns are popular with consumers as hunting, personal protection, and sporting target rifles and are sold through our sporting good distributors, retailers, and dealers. We offer M&P modern sporting rifles in four different calibers (22LR, 5.56mm NATO (223), 308 Winchester (7.62x51mm), and 6.5 Creedmoor) for multiple recreational and professional uses. We also offer upper assemblies so firearm owners can easily modify their M&P to suit the needs and tasks of the various forms of sport shooting and hunting. Our broad product portfolio of modern sporting rifles includes a 22 caliber model, an opening price-point sport model, a hunting caliber model for longer range effectiveness, and several models designed for the exclusive use of military and law enforcement agencies throughout the world. 
 We manufacture three lines of bolt-action rifles under our Thompson/Center Arms brand with several models in each line. These long guns are offered in over nine different calibers. Bolt-action rifles operate by the cycling of a bolt handle that allows for both the loading and unloading of rounds via a magazine fed system. This design allows for multi-round capacity and a level of strength that supports larger calibers. Our bolt-action rifles feature 5R rifling and a minute of angle guarantee. We offer compact rifles for shooters of smaller stature. Bolt-action rifles are the most popular firearm among hunters because of their reputation for accuracy, reliability, and relatively light-weight design. 
 Under our Thompson/Center Arms brand, we also offer four lines of high-quality American-made single-shot “black powder,” or “muzzleloader,” firearms. Ammunition for our black powder firearms is loaded through the muzzle rather than the breech, as is the case with conventional firearms. Our black powder firearms are highly accurate, dependable rifles configured with muzzle loading barrels for hunting. Black powder firearms are 
 5


purchased by hunting enthusiasts, primarily for use during exclusive black powder hunting seasons for hunting big game, such as deer and elk.
We offer two models of interchangeable, single-shot firearm systems that deliver numerous firearm, barrel, and caliber configurations and finishes. These firearm systems can be purchased fully assembled or as frame assemblies that can be configured by the owner as a center-fire rifle, rim-fire rifle, shotgun, black powder firearm, or single-shot handgun for use across the entire range of big- and small-game hunting. As a result, a firearm owner can easily change barrels, stocks, and fore-ends, resulting in “one firearm for all seasons” that can be continuously modified to suit the needs and tasks of the owner for various forms of sport shooting and hunting.
 With the recently announced plan to divest the Thompson/Center Arms brand, we will continue to direct focus on the hunting and long-range shooting products under the Smith & Wesson brand. 
 Other Products and Manufacturing Services 
 Our other products and manufacturing services include the following: 
 Parts: We sell parts to support our firearm business, including barrels and magazines that are manufactured at our facilities or purchased through third parties. 
 Handcuffs: We are one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the United States. We fabricate these products from the highest-grade carbon or stainless steel. Our patented Lever Lock cuffs offer a double-locking system for added security and comfort, without extra tools or keys. Double heat-treated internal locks help prevent tampering, and smooth ratchets allow for swift cuffing and an extra measure of safety. We have the ability to customize handcuffs to fit customer specifications. 
 Suppressors: We are the nation’s oldest firearm suppressor manufacturer and an active participant in the firearm suppressor market around the world. Our Gemtech branded suppressors were the first to market in 1976 and have been involved in setting standards used by the military in suppressor testing, implementation, and safety. Our suppressors are constructed from high grade aluminum, steel, or titanium and are compatible with every major type of rimfire and centerfire pistol and centerfire rifle caliber currently on the market. 
 Manufacturing Services: We utilize our substantial manufacturing capabilities to provide services to third-party customers. Our manufacturing services include forging, heat treating, rapid prototyping, tooling, finishing, plating, machining, and custom plastic injection molding. We believe our manufacturing services provide us with increased flexibility and reduced supply chain risk. We also believe that business-to-business sales provide profitable revenue stream diversification and enable us to maximize capacity utilization of our manufacturing assets. We market our manufacturing services division under the Smith & Wesson and Smith & Wesson Precision Components brand names. 
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution 
 General
 We go to market in a variety of ways, including two-step distribution, strategic retailers, and buying groups consisting of certain large, regional retailers, utilizing direct sales employees to service these customers. We also sell firearms directly to law enforcement agencies and manufacturing services directly to other businesses. We sell internationally primarily through distributors, which in turn sell to retail stores and government agencies. 
 Our top five commercial distributors in the United States accounted for a total of 43.4% and 40.8% of our net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Those commercial distributors are not regionally exclusive and have many of the same dealer customers. Therefore, we believe that the loss of one or more of these distributors would not materially impact sales as the remaining distributors would be allocated additional sales. 
 6


We sell our products worldwide. International sales accounted for 2%, 4%, and 5% of our net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our businesses own tooling that is located at various suppliers in Asia and North America.
 For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, marketing, advertising, and promotion expenses for continuing operations were $12.5 million, $13.6 million, and $13.4 million, respectively, excluding the cost of rebates and promotions reflected in gross profit.
 We market our products using a multi-faceted approach to consumers through independent dealers, large retailers, in-store retail channels, direct to consumer, and range operations using focused marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print, broadcast, and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; and in-store retail merchandising strategies. We are prominently featured in vertical print media, including editorial coverage in an extensive list of leading firearms and outdoor magazines, including Guns & Ammo, American Rifleman, Shooting Times, American Handgunner, Shooting Illustrated, American Hunter, Outdoor Life, and Field & Stream. We also sponsor many outdoor television, internet, and online programs that generate significant editorial exposure. We sponsor a number of firearm safety, shooting, and hunting events and organizations. 
 We print various product catalogs that are distributed to our dealers and mailed directly, on a limited basis, to consumers. We also attend various trade shows, such as the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, the NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits, the National Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers Show, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Show, the Association of the United States Army Show, or AUSA Show, the International Weapons Exhibition Show, or IWA Show, in Europe, and various distributor, buying group, and consumer shows. 
 GUNSMARTS: The SMITH & WESSON GUNSMARTS program is designed to welcome new firearm owners into the firearm community and highlight key resources available to those who have just purchased their first pistol, rifle, or revolver. As a cornerstone of the campaign, we released a new video series devoted to helping inform, educate, and excite those who have recently joined the firearm community. Hosted on YouTube, the SMITH & WESSON GUNSMARTS video series covers a comprehensive set of topics that takes the viewer from the basics of firearm safety through their first trips to the range – all in a simple, inviting manner.
Digital Marketing 
 We utilize our websites, including www.smith-wesson.com and www.gemtech.com to market our products and services and to provide a wide range of information regarding our company to customers, consumers, dealers, distributors, investors, and government and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter are effective ways for us to communicate the features and benefits of our products. Our direct to consumer e-mail marketing helps us to further engage our consumers and communicate the value of our brands. We continue to invest in new digital marketing capabilities to provide best-in-class customer experiences. Our websites are designed to inform, inspire, and prepare our customers for the next step in their firearms journey. We believe our digital platform supports future sales growth and profitability. 
Service and Support 
 We utilize a variety of methods for supporting our consumers and dealers. We have a toll-free customer service number, e-mail, and social media messaging to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our products. In addition, we offer a limited one-year warranty program and a lifetime service policy under which we repair defects in material or workmanship in our products without charge for as long as the original purchaser owns the firearm. We also maintain a number of authorized warranty centers throughout the world and provide both warranty and charge repair services at our facilities.

Suppliers 
 We manufacture most of the components for our firearms, but purchase certain components and parts, including bolt carriers, rifle receivers, magazines, small parts, and rifle stocks, from third parties. We also purchase ammunition for product testing. Most of our major suppliers for our products are U.S.-based and provide materials, components, and parts, such as steel, polymer components, and metal-injected-molded components. The costs of these materials, components, and parts are at competitive rates. We have become less dependent on any particular supplier by strategically sourcing parts and raw material from multiple suppliers based on quality, cost, and risk. Whenever appropriate, critical parts and components have primary and secondary sources of supply.  We are also able to leverage our supply base to supplement our internal capacity and provide flexibility in our response to changes in market conditions. We use numerous raw materials, such as steel, wood, lead, brass, and plastics, in producing and testing our products. We have alternative sources for these raw materials. 
Facilities 
 We have three manufacturing facilities at which we produce our products: a 575,000 square-foot facility located in Springfield, Massachusetts; two facilities totaling 44,000 square-feet located in Houlton, Maine; and a 150,000 square-foot facility located in Deep River, Connecticut. We conduct our handgun and long gun manufacturing and some of our manufacturing service activities at our Springfield facility. Our Houlton facility is a machining center only with no assembly, finishing, or small parts operations. We also produce handcuffs and other restraint devices at our Houlton facility. We use our Deep River facility for custom plastic injection molding services, rapid prototyping, and tooling. All of these facilities are ISO 9001 certified.
 We perform in our own facilities most of the machining and all of the assembly, inspection, and testing of the firearms that we sell. We produce our major firearm components utilizing computer-assisted machines. Our skilled employees use sophisticated automated testing equipment to ensure the proper functioning of our firearms. Every firearm is test fired before shipment. Our Springfield and Houlton facilities are currently operating on two shift patterns; a four shift, 168 hour per week schedule and a three shift, 120 hour per week schedule.
 In Columbia, Missouri, we lease a 633,000 square foot facility, which was constructed for us, completed in November 2018, and then sold and leased back by us.  This facility serves as our distribution center and operates two shifts of four 10-hour days. We sublease 59% of this facility to our former outdoor products and accessories subsidiary under the same terms as the master lease.  
 We seek to minimize inventory costs through an integrated planning and production system. All facilities operate under SAP, a fully integrated ERP system. We intend to continue investing in improving our facilities and our systems in order to increase efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls.
 Research and Development
 Through our advanced products engineering departments, we enhance existing products and develop new products for all our businesses. Through our research and development personnel, we conceive, design, and develop potential products that we believe will be attractive to our customers and help address the needs, wants, and desires of our target consumer base. In so doing, we must seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by continually adjusting our product mix with innovative features and designs and marketing them in an effective manner. Prior to introducing any product, we assess its cost of production and delivery, estimate its potential sales volume and margin, and conduct vigorous prototype and production-quality sample testing. In fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, our gross spending on research activities relating to the development of new products was $7.5 million, $7.4 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2021, we had 44 employees at our various facilities engaged in ongoing research and development activities for all of our brands. 
Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights 
 We recognize the importance of innovation and protecting our intellectual property. Accordingly, we own numerous patents related to our products. We apply for patents whenever we develop innovative new products, 
 8


unique designs, or processes of commercial importance. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent. 
 Because of the significance of our brand names, our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and copyrights are also important to our business. We have an active global program of trademark registration, monitoring, and enforcement. We believe that our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech brands and our S&W monogram trademarks are known and recognized by the public worldwide and are important to our firearm business.   
 We intend to vigorously pursue and challenge infringements of our patents, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and copyrights, as we believe the goodwill associated with them is a cornerstone of our branding strategy. 
 Competition 
 We encounter competition in the firearms industry from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Although some competitors manufacture a wide variety of firearms as we do, most of our competitors manufacture only certain types of firearms. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We compete primarily based upon innovation, quality, reliability, durability, price, performance, consumer brand awareness, and customer service and support. Our customer service organization is proactive in offering timely responses to customer inquiries. We believe we can effectively compete with all our present competitors. Our primary competitors are Ruger and Taurus in the revolver market, and Glock, Ruger, Sig Sauer, Springfield Armory, and Taurus in the pistol market. We compete primarily with Sig Sauer, Ruger, Remington, Savage, and Daniel Defense in the modern sporting rifle market and Browning, Remington, Ruger, Savage, CVA, and Traditions in the hunting rifle market.  
Customers 
 We sell our products through a variety of federally licensed distribution channels. Depending upon the product or service, our customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; retailers; and consumers. 
 We grant payment terms to most commercial customers ranging from 20 to 90 days. However, in some instances, we provide longer payment terms, particularly as it relates to our fall dating programs for hunting sales, which provides payment terms due in the fall for certain orders of hunting products received in the spring and summer.
 During fiscal 2021, sales into our professional channel accounted for approximately 6.0% of our net sales, which included state and local law enforcement agencies, the federal government, and international customers. The remaining 94.0% of our net sales was through federal firearm licensees to domestic consumers. 
 Seasonality
 Our business is seasonal with sales generally peaking in our fourth fiscal quarter, which ends April 30, as a result of most industry events and distributor shows normally scheduled during the early spring months. In addition, because of our operating schedule, which includes a summer and a winter shutdown of our manufacturing facilities, we have an increased number of operating days in our fourth fiscal quarter, which allows our shipping and production volumes to exceed other quarters. Seasonality, however, can be disrupted by external events that may drive sales or impact channel inventories, which may slow or accelerate our sales. 
Governmental Regulations of Firearms
 Our business is primarily regulated by the ATF, which licenses the manufacture, sale, and import of firearms and suppressors in the United States. The ATF conducts periodic audits of our facilities that hold Federal Firearms Licenses.

There are also various state laws, regulations, and local ordinances relating to firearm characteristics, features, and sales, as well as firearm magazine capacities. Local firearm dealers must comply with state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances pertaining to firearm, suppressor, and magazine sales within their jurisdictions. We manufacture several firearm models and magazines in various capacities that comply with those laws, regulations, and ordinances for sales in those states and localities. In Massachusetts, for example, there are regulations related to the weight of the trigger pull, barrel length, material strength, and independent testing of handguns. California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, as well as other states, the District of Columbia, and other localities, have similar laws, ordinances, and restrictions. In addition, California and the District of Columbia require new pistols to contain a microstamping mechanism, which must be able to etch or imprint, in two locations, a microstamp array of characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistols onto each cartridge case when the pistol is fired. No commercially produced firearm has utilized the microstamping process, which is considered by most to be unfeasible, and we have no plans to utilize any microstamping feature in our firearms. Therefore, we will not sell into California or the District of Columbia any pistol that is subject to the microstamping feature requirement. 
 Warnings and instructions concerning the safe operation of our firearms and suppressors are contained in Safety & Instruction Manuals included in all boxes in which firearms and suppressors are shipped and are also available for download from our Smith & Wesson, Thompson/Center Arms, and Gemtech websites.
 Environmental Health and Safety 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that regulate the health and safety of our workforce, including those regulations monitored by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Department of Public Health. Though not exhaustive, examples of applicable regulations include confined space safety, walking and working surfaces, machine guarding, and life safety. 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. These laws require us to make significant expenditures of both a capital and expense nature. Several of the more significant federal laws applicable to our operations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA; and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA. 
 We are required to remediate hazardous waste at our facilities. Currently, we own a designated site in Springfield, Massachusetts that contains two release areas, which are the focus of remediation projects as part of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or MCP. The MCP provides a structured environment for the voluntary remediation of regulated releases. We may be required to remove hazardous waste or remediate the alleged effects of hazardous substances on the environment associated with past disposal practices at sites not owned by us. We have received notice that we are a potentially responsible party from the Environmental Protection Agency and/or individual states under CERCLA or a state equivalent at two sites. 
 In our efforts to satisfy our environmental responsibilities and to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have established, and periodically update, policies relating to the environmental standards of performance for our operations. We have in place programs that monitor compliance with various federal, state, and local environmental regulations. However, in the normal course of our manufacturing operations, we are subject to governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal, air emissions, and water discharges from our operations into the environment. We regularly incur substantial capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws, including remediation of known environmental conditions which we fund through cash flows from operations. We spent $1.3 million in fiscal 2021 on environmental compliance, consisting of $846,000 on disposal fees and containers, $346,000 for remediation, $65,000 for DEP analysis and air filtration fees, and $63,000 on reporting and compliance. We spent $1.2 million in fiscal 2020 on environmental compliance, consisting of $918,000 for disposal fees and containers, $237,000 for remediation, and $60,000 for DEP analysis and air filtration fees.

In the normal course of our business, we may become involved in various proceedings relating to environmental health and safety matters, and we are currently engaged in an environmental investigation and remediation. Our manufacturing facilities are located on properties with a long history of industrial use, including the use of hazardous substances. We have identified soil and groundwater contamination at our Springfield, Massachusetts plant that we continue to monitor and remediate, as appropriate. Based on the situation, an environmental reserve may be recorded based upon currently enacted laws and regulations, currently available facts, experience in remediation efforts, existing technology, and the ability of other potentially responsible parties or contractually liable parties to pay the allocated portions of any environmental obligations. As of April 30, 2021, we do not have an open environmental reserve recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. 
 Based on information known to us, we do not expect current environmental regulations or environmental proceedings and claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on us of future environmental compliance requirements or of the cost of resolution of future environmental health and safety proceedings and claims, in part because the scope of the remedies that may be required is not certain, liability under federal environmental laws is joint and several in nature, and environmental laws and regulations are subject to modification and changes in interpretation. There can be no assurance that additional or changing environmental regulation will not become more burdensome in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our company.
 Human Capital
 Creating a positive work environment for our employees is critical to our ability to successfully execute our strategy. We are committed to a strong, healthy culture focused on respect for all employees, creating and sustaining a family atmosphere, united under a clear vision, with the understanding of each function and individual’s responsibility for team results, collective pride in our company and our industry, and shared rewards for results.  In order to ensure that we embody our values and that our culture remains healthy and strong, we place significant focus on our human resources.
Training & Development
 
Attraction, retention, and development of employees is critical to our success.  We offer training and development programs to encourage advancement from within, including the following:
  
• | tuition reimbursement for up to 100% of an employee’s advanced degree;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | computer numerical control (CNC) machine apprentice training at a local community college in conjunction with a state-funded program;

In addition, we offer a “high potential” development program for top performers with the intention that they can be developed, mentored, and ultimately promoted into higher level roles.  Finally, we conduct quarterly training for all employees on various topics, such as sexual harassment, bribery, anti-corruption, cybersecurity, phishing, and insider trading, among others.

 We contract a third party to review compensation practices on an annual basis to ensure we pay all employees equitably. 
 
Health and Safety
 
Our Employee Assistance Program is supplemented by Cigna behavioral health tools in order to support employees’ mental as well as physical health needs.
 
As an essential business, we pride ourselves on having safely and effectively continued running our operations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, we increased pay for those employees who continued to report to work on-site to keep our business running. These employees turned out record quarters during fiscal 2021, despite the challenges we all faced both at work and at home.  
 
We have a documented education and training plan to ensure employees are well trained on safety measures throughout the organization.  We offer more than 55 different types of training, including lecture, classroom setting, and hands-on training to ensure our employees have the knowledge needed to ensure their safety, as well as the safety of others.  The success of our training program has allowed us to maintain a low level of safety claims and reduce lost work hours. Our calendar year 2020 and 2019 total recordable incident rate (TRIR) of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively, and lost time incident rate (LTIR) of 0.4 for both years compares favorably to the latest OSHA industry data. According to OSHA, for our NAICS industry code, the calendar year 2019 TRIR was 2.1 and the LTIR was 0.8.
 
Total Rewards
 
Competitive pay and benefits have always been a highlight of our employee experience. We offer comprehensive benefit programs to our employees that allow them flexibility of choice through our Total Rewards framework of pay and service recognition, health and wellness, financial well-being, work/life balance, culture and community, and learning and development.
