Item 1.    Business
Overview
Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. was incorporated on May 24, 1999 in the state of Delaware and began its principal operations in November 1999. Unless the context requires otherwise, the words “Cornerstone,” “we,” “Company,” “us” and “our” refer to Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Cornerstone is a leading global provider of learning and people development solutions, delivered as software-as-a-service.We were founded with a passion for empowering people through learning and a conviction that people should be an organization’s greatest competitive advantage. We believe people can achieve anything when they have the right development and growth opportunities. We offer organizations the technology, content, expertise, and specialized focus to help them realize their potential. Cornerstone’s people development solutions feature comprehensive recruiting, personalized learning, modern content delivered in the flow of work, development-driven performance management, and holistic workforce data management and insights. On April 22, 2020, the Company acquired Saba Software, Inc. (“Saba”), a provider of talent experience solutions. We are actively engaged in integrating Saba. Together, the combined Company reaches over 6,000 customers of all sizes, spanning more than 75 million users across over 180 countries and nearly 50 languages.
We work with customers across all geographies and markets. Our customers include multi-national corporations, large domestic and foreign-based enterprises, mid-market companies, public sector organizations, healthcare providers, higher education institutions, non-profit organizations, and small businesses. We sell our solutions domestically and internationally through both direct and indirect channels, including direct sales teams throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific and distributor relationships with payroll companies, human resource consultancies, and global system integrators.

The Market
The human capital management (“HCM”) technology market is one of the largest in the software industry. According to an International Data Corporation (“IDC”) market forecast report, titled “Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker” published in May 2020, the global market for Human Capital Management applications was predicted to be $23.7 billion by 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5.1%.
Our People Development Solutions
Our people development solutions are comprehensive SaaS solutions that help organizations manage their recruiting, learning, performance, and HR administration processes. These solutions are supplemented by state-of-the-art analytics and reporting as well as a number of cross-product tools for employee profile management and e-learning content aggregation and delivery. We believe that our people development solutions deliver the following benefits:
•Comprehensive Functionality. Our solutions provide a comprehensive approach to people development by offering products to address all stages of the employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, learning, performance, succession, compensation, enterprise social collaboration, and HR administration processes. Employees use our solutions throughout their careers to engage in performance processes such as goal management, performance reviews, continuous feedback, competency assessments, and compensatory reviews; to complete job-specific and compliance-related training; to evaluate potential career changes, development plans, or succession processes; and to connect and collaborate with co-workers by leveraging enterprise social networking tools. Employee managers and HR managers use our solutions to perform their people development administrative responsibilities effectively throughout their employees’ careers. We believe our comprehensive, unified solutions enable our customers to align their people development processes and practices with their broader strategic goals.
•Flexible and Highly Configurable. Our solutions offer substantial configurability that allow our customers to match the use of our software with their specific business processes and workflows. We also provide web services to facilitate the importing and exporting of data to and from other customer systems, such as enterprise resource planning and human resource information system solutions. Our customers can configure various features, functions, and work-flows in our solutions by business unit, division, department, region, location, job position, pay grade, cost center, or self-defined organizational unit. Our customers are able to adjust features to configure specific processes, such as performance review workflows or training approvals, to match their existing or desired practices. This high level of configurability means that custom coding projects generally are not required to meet the diverse needs of our customers.
•Easy-to-Use, Personalized User Interface. Our solutions employ an intuitive user interface and may be personalized for the end user, typically based on position, division, pay grade, location, manager, and particular use of the solutions. This ease of use limits the need for end-user training, which we believe increases user adoption rates and usage. 
•Software-as-a-Service Solutions Lowers the Total Cost of Ownership and Speeds Delivery. Our solutions are accessible through a standard web browser and do not require the large investments in implementation time, personnel, hardware, and consulting that are typical of hosted or on-premise solutions. With a single code base to maintain, we are able to release improved functionality on a quarterly basis. This is a more rapid pace than most hosted or on-premise solution providers can afford to deliver.
•Scalable to Meet the Needs of Organizations. Our solutions have been used by Fortune 100 companies since 2001. While the complex needs of these global corporations required us to build solutions that can scale to support large, geographically-distributed employee bases, our solutions are capable of supporting deployments of various sizes. 
•Insights and Predictive Analysis. Our solutions leverage technology powered by a highly refined machine learning system for people development. We also offer a large network of shared talent data. This enables leaders to answer critical questions about how to better hire, manage, retain, and reward talent with dashboards that can be drilled down to individual employee data. Enhanced by additional Cornerstone suite usage, these insights allow organizations to manage their people development process proactively and be strategic with initiatives that affect thousands of employees across many groups and locations. Additionally, the Cornerstone Innovation Lab for Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) unites all our data scientists and data ethics experts across the company to form a center of excellence to advance AI in the workplace.
•Continued Innovation through Collaborative Product Development. We work collaboratively with our customers on an ongoing basis to develop almost every part of our solutions. The vast majority of our thousands of software features were designed using feedback from existing and prospective customers based on their specific functional requests.
•Focus on Data Privacy and Security. We have designed our solutions to meet certain rigorous industry and jurisdictional security standards and to help assure customers that their sensitive data is protected across the system. We use commercially reasonable methods and technology designed to ensure high levels of security by logically segregating each customer’s data from the data of other customers and by enforcing a consistent approach to roles and rights within the system. These restrictions limit system access to only those individuals authorized by our customers. We also employ multiple standard technologies, protocols, and processes to monitor, test, and certify the security of our infrastructure continuously. 
Our comprehensive people development solutions help organizations manage key phases of the employee life cycle. To complement our solutions, we offer a number of cross-product tools for analytics and reporting, employee profile management, and e-learning content aggregation. 
Learning 
Learning. Our Learning solutions help customers deliver mobile-ready, enterprise-class training, and development programs. They link employee development to other parts of the talent management lifecycle, including onboarding, performance management, and succession planning. They support all forms of learning, including online, instructor-led, and collaborative on-the-job learning, as well as robust reporting and embedded predictive analytics. With tens of thousands of online training titles from dozens of global content providers accessible through our engaging learning experience solutions, customers reduce overall training expenses, while quickly transforming their learning programs with modern, curated content. The access to personalized content delivered at scale with Cornerstone’s machine learning technology builds a culture of continuous learning, boosting employee engagement and retention.
Cornerstone Extended Enterprise. Our extended enterprise product helps customers provide training and enablement to their customers, vendors, and distributors. The extended enterprise product empowers customers to develop new profit centers, increase sales, cut support costs, and boost channel productivity.

Content
Content. Our Content solution enables organizations to deliver fresh, modern content to their workforce. We have entered into license agreements with a wide range of vendors that provide off-the-shelf e-learning content and custom learning content development services. Through this network, we offer an extensive library of online training content to our customers through our Learning solutions. 
Content Anytime. Our proprietary, foundational e-learning content subscriptions provide access to pre-curated packages, which include content from our own content production arm (Cornerstone Studios) and other content partners, on a variety of popular topics.
Performance 
Performance. Our performance management solutions allow customers to direct and measure performance at the individual, departmental, and organizational levels through ongoing competency management, organizational goal setting, performance appraisal, development planning, and feedback. Performance data can also be used by the Learning solutions to set training priorities and to make informed workforce planning decisions. 
Succession. Our succession solutions allow customers to proactively plan for organizational change and talent mobility. They serve both the employee looking for career advancement and management team members planning for the future. Employees can share career preferences and discover development opportunities. Management team members can utilize tools provided to identify skill gaps, implement development plans, and create talent pools for future needs.
Compensation. Our compensation solutions allow customers to reward their employees for hard work in direct relation to performance. They enable customers to make more informed decisions about the allocation of base pay, bonus, and equity awards.
Careers
Careers. Our Careers solution supports continuous career development and enables managers to be better coaches through a range of capabilities including the ability to hold 1:1s to track team development, goal setting, creation of development plans, pulse surveys, career exploration tools and the ability to provide continuous feedback. By helping people continuously perform better and achieve their goals, businesses will achieve their goals as well.
Recruiting 
Recruiting. Our applicant tracking solutions support the modern ways that organizations attract and hire new employees. From easily tracking applicants through the hiring process, to managing interviews and tracking feedback, our solutions simplify processes to save recruiters and hiring managers time. With mobile-friendly, customizable career sites, organizations can showcase their unique employer brand to attract top talent.
Onboarding. Our onboarding solutions enable customers to tailor resources based on a new hire’s specific position, avoiding wasted effort and enabling new hires to focus on meaningful activities that accelerate productivity. They help new employees acclimate quickly by providing a personalized, modern, onboarding experience that equips them with the right resources. The onboarding product complements the recruiting product by providing a seamless and engaging experience for the employee, while reducing administrative burden and promoting collaboration across departments. 
HR 
HR. Our HR solution offers a modern interface for centralized HR administration across an organization’s disparate systems. Acting as a source of truth for core employee and talent data, the system supports employee self-service, absence management, organization management, and records administration. 
View. Our view solution allows customers to access HR data across our people development products. The view product enables organizations to utilize interactive data visualization tools to discover their top performers and future leaders, proactively answer workforce questions, and achieve business results.
Benchmark. Our benchmark solution enables organizations to compare internal employee data with peers in external companies or across divisions, subdivisions, subsidiaries, or regions within their own organization. Both options allow the organization to visualize how they compare against custom and internal business segments across a variety of metrics.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to empower people, organizations, and communities to realize their potential with comprehensive people development solutions that are built to last. Our growth strategy since inception has been deliberate and focused on long-term success. This has allowed us to weather periods of economic turmoil and significant changes in the markets we serve without experiencing business contraction. We plan to continue with the same systematic approach in the future. Key elements of our strategy include:
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technological Leadership. Over the last 20 years, we believe we have developed a deep understanding of the people development challenges our customers face. We continually collaborate with our customers to build extensive functionality that addresses their specific needs and requests. We plan to continue to leverage our expertise in people development and customer relationships to develop new products, features, and functionality that will enhance our solutions and expand our addressable market. We plan to continue our policy of implementing best practices across our organization, expanding our technical operations, and investing in our network infrastructure and service capabilities in order to support continued future growth. We believe that continued innovation is key to success in expanding our business with existing customers and reaching new customers. We plan to continue to invest in research and development innovation initiatives, such as our Cornerstone Innovation Lab, to develop new products.
Retain and Expand Business with Existing Customers. We believe our existing installed base of customers offers a substantial opportunity for growth, and we plan to undertake initiatives to improve our customer retention as well as expand sales of new and existing products into our customer base.
•Focus on Customer Success, Retention, and Growth. We believe focusing on our customers’ success leads to our own success. We have continued to build on our Customer Success Framework that governs our operating model. We strive to maximize our customer retention rates by continuing to invest in our global support resources and improving upon our delivery model by investing in training and support initiatives to ensure that service requirements are met with strong satisfaction. Our net annual dollar retention rate in 2020 was 95.1 %, a decline from 104.6 % in 2019. This decline was driven by the anticipated churn of a significant non-recurring contract signed in 2019, churn from (or one-time concessions provided to) customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and expected churn in our non-core product base.
•Sell Additional Products to Existing Customers. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity in selling additional functionality to our existing customers. Many customers have added functionality subsequent to their initial deployments as they recognize the benefits of our unified solutions. With our expanding product portfolio functionality, we believe significant upsell opportunity remains within our existing customer base. Furthermore, we believe the addition of customers acquired from Saba offers a significant cross-sell opportunity for products within our existing portfolio, including but not limited to, Content Anytime.
Focus on Growing Recurring Revenue. Our go-to-market strategy involves driving recurring revenue growth. We believe our primary growth drivers are as follows: 
•Continue to Invest in Direct Sales Initiatives Domestically. We believe the market for people development is large and remains significantly underpenetrated. We plan to continue to invest resources in direct sales initiatives to acquire new customers. We believe concentrating sales resources in markets with higher win rates will provide us the flexibility and return on investment to test new markets for growth.
•Continue to Invest in Our International Operations. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to continue to grow sales of our solutions internationally. We intend to continue to grow our Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific and Japan (“APJ”) operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 36.6 % of our total revenue from regions outside of the United States. We expect this percentage to grow in the future.
•Continue to Grow and Develop Our Content Anytime Subscriptions. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for developing employees throughout their careers with modern, fresh e-learning content. Our Content Anytime subscription solution provides access to industry leading content which we believe will increase user engagement with our solution. Our content partners for Content Anytime include industry leaders as well as regional, functional, and vertically-focused online training providers. In addition, we have agreements with providers of specific competency models for use by our customers directly in our people development solutions. We intend to enter into additional license agreements to continue providing the best content available for our customers. Furthermore, we plan to continue to invest in developing new Content Anytime subscriptions that focus on highly regulated industries, such as the public sector and healthcare, to meet demand from existing and new customers.
•Expand the Ecosystem. We have migrated a sizable portion of our implementation services to our partners, and have recently migrated Saba’s legacy implementation services to our partners. In recent years, we have also expanded our relationships with various third-party consulting firms to deliver the successful implementation of our solutions and to optimize our customers’ use of our solutions during the terms of their engagements. Our partner strategy and experience includes certifications and curricula developed to facilitate successful delivery by our partners and continued high customer satisfaction. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage these third-parties interested in building or expanding their businesses to increase our market penetration. 
Increase Operating Income and Free Cash Flow. We are focused on managing our costs while making smart investments to scale our operations, which we believe will support growth in recurring revenue and our long-term success over time. We have been optimizing our network delivery operations for the long-term by transitioning our data center operations to the public cloud, which we believe will provide us the long-term flexibility to expand our solutions and enter new markets without having to invest in and develop new local data centers. We plan to continue to assess and execute on operational excellence initiatives to optimize our margin profile, which we believe will enable further leverage in our expense structure and growth in operating income and free cash flow.
Acquisitions and Strategic Investments. We may acquire or invest in additional businesses, products, or technologies that we believe will complement or expand our solutions, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Most recently, in April 2020, we acquired Saba, a provider of talent experience solutions. In January 2020, we acquired Clustree, a developer of a skills engine and skills ontology. In December 2019, we invested in Talespin Inc. (“Talespin”), a developer of enterprise virtual reality training software. In November 2018, we acquired Grovo Learning, Inc. (“Grovo”), a provider of Microlearning® content. In September 2018, we acquired Workpop Inc. (“Workpop”), a web and mobile solution for candidates and hiring managers in service-based industries. We acquired Saba to expand our customer base; we acquired Clustree to accelerate the development of a skills engine; we acquired Grovo to enhance our Content solution; and we acquired Workpop to enhance our Recruiting solutions.
Global Customer Success
We are dedicated to the success of our customers. We have developed a Customer Success Framework, which governs our operational model, the structure of our customer management teams, and the types of services necessary at each stage of a customer’s lifecycle.
Within this framework, we have developed the following roles with primary responsibility to our customers at various levels of their organizations:
•Customer executives who interact with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at a customer and are focused on the overall relationship, including sales to existing customers;
•Customer success managers who work directly with executive-level sponsors and human resources executives at our customers to maximize the value of their investment in our people development solutions; and
•Product specialists who interact with customer administrators and are focused on features and functions of our people development solutions.
We offer support in multiple languages, at multiple levels, and through multiple channels, including global support coverage available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We use our own enterprise social collaboration product to provide our customers and distributors with a virtual community to collaborate on product design, release management, and best practices.
We monitor customer satisfaction internally as part of formalized programs and at regular intervals during the customer lifecycle, including during the transition from sales to implementation, at the completion of a consulting project, and daily based on interactions with our customer-facing teams.
Technology, Operations, and Research and Development
The cloud versions of our flagship people development solutions are designed and deployed with an on-demand, multi-tenant, and multi-user architecture which our customers access via a standard web browser. We utilize a single code base, with all of our customers running on the current version of our software. We employ a modularized architecture to balance the load of customers on separate sub-environments, as well as to provide a flexible method for scalability without impacting other parts of the current environment. This architecture allows us to provide the high levels of uptime required by our customers. Our existing infrastructure has been designed with sufficient capacity to meet our current and estimated near term future needs. Global uptime in 2020 was 99.997%.
Currently, we physically host our solutions for our customers in secure third-party data center facilities located in the US, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Canada, Australia, The Netherlands, France, and Germany. We continue to evaluate other locations for physically hosting our solutions and, therefore, these locations may change. These facilities provide leading security and other protections including physical security, biometric access controls, systems security, redundant power, and environmental controls.
We are continuing to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a view to migrating more software to the public cloud over time. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities as we continue moving from a monolithic to a microservices architecture. We maintain the same or higher standards of security and compliance with our public cloud providers as we do in our leased facilities. One of our Recruiting solutions, TalentLink, is fully hosted in multiple Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) regions.
In addition, we maintain legacy implementations of our on-premise software solutions, where customers are responsible for their own infrastructure. We are actively promoting migration to the cloud versions of these solutions where appropriate.
Our ability to compete depends largely on our continuous commitment to product development and ability to rapidly introduce new products, technologies, features, and functionality. The responsibilities of our research and development organization include product management, product development, quality assurance, IT security, and technology operations. Our research and development organization is global, with our major engineering centers currently located in the US, Israel, New Zealand, Poland, and India. 
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell our software, content, and services both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our domestic and international network of distributors. We currently service customers in a wide range of industries, including, among others business services, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, insurance, manufacturing, retail, and high technology. We have a number of direct sales teams organized by market, industry vertical, and geographic regions such as the Americas, EMEA, and APJ. 
Our direct sales team is supported by product specialists who provide technical and product expertise to facilitate the sales process. Our sales enablement professionals provide on-boarding and ongoing professional development for the sales professionals to increase their effectiveness at selling in the field. We also maintain a separate team of customer executives responsible for renewals and upsells to existing customers.
Marketing
We manage global demand generation programs, develop sales pipelines, and enhance brand awareness through our marketing initiatives. Our marketing programs target HR executives, technology professionals, and senior business leaders. Our principal marketing initiatives include:
•Demand Generation. Our demand generation activities include targeted account-based marketing, lead generation through email and direct mail campaigns, participation in industry events, securing event speaking opportunities, and online marketing, including both search engine marketing and organic search engine optimization online marketing.
•Corporate Marketing. We market to our customers by leveraging product marketing, customer success stories, thought leadership content, and brand awareness advertising campaigns. Additionally, we host product advisory communities and executive advisory councils; we also co-market with our strategic distributors, including joint press announcements and demand generation activities.
•Marketing Communications. We undertake media relations, corporate communications, industry analyst and influencer relations activities, customer advocacy, and social media engagement.
Competition
The market for people development software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented. This market is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Most of our sales efforts are competitive, often involving requests for proposals. We compete primarily on the basis of providing a highly configurable, comprehensive, fully unified solutions for people development as opposed to specific service offerings.
In the applicant tracking systems market which our Recruiting solutions serve, our principal competitors include companies such as iCIMS, Oracle Corporation (Taleo), and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). In the learning systems market, which our Learning solutions each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Docebo, and Workday, Inc. In the performance management and continuous performance systems market, which our Performance solutions each serve, our principal competitors include companies such as Oracle Corporation, SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors), Talentsoft SA, and Workday, Inc. In the learning content market, which our Content solution serves, our principal competitors include SkillSoft Limited and LinkedIn Learning. In the core HR market, which our HR solution serves, our principal competitors include Oracle Corporation, Workday, Inc., and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). When implemented together, these products also serve as integrated talent and HCM solutions, competing primarily against SkillSoft Limited (SumTotal), Oracle Corporation, Workday, Inc., and SAP America, Inc. (SuccessFactors). These vendors are, like us, largely SaaS providers. We compete in these markets primarily on the basis of:
•the level of integration of our product offerings within our people development solutions;
•the breadth and depth of our product functionality;
•the flexibility and configurability of our product offerings to meet the changing content and workflow requirements of our customers’ business units;
•the quality of our service and focus on customer success;
•our ability to provide scalability and flexibility for large and complex global deployments; 
•our ability to meet the needs of highly regulated industries; and
•the ease of use of our product offerings and overall user experience.
In addition, we occasionally compete with custom-built software that is designed to support the needs of a single organization, as well as with third-party talent and human resource application providers that focus on specific aspects of people development.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger marketing resources than we do. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Nature of Our Business—The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.”
Human Capital Management
At Cornerstone, our people are our greatest asset. We believe that when you create a work culture that fosters ongoing growth and development, your people can rise to become extraordinary. Just as we support our customers with the technology, learning content, and expertise to bring out the best in their people, we do the same for our people. We are committed to ensuring our people have the right skills, capabilities, and opportunities to adapt and thrive. When our people succeed, our business does, too. 
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,900 employees in more than 20 countries around the world. 
Culture of Growth and Development
More than 20 years ago, we started with a mission to educate the world. That focus on learning is still a core piece of who we are as a company. We provide numerous opportunities and resources to instill a culture of continuous learning, starting with our own people. We provide online learning courses using our own technology to help our people build new skills and grow in their careers. In addition to letting people explore our broad library of learning content, we also serve up recommended trainings based on an individual’s career path and interest areas. 
Additionally, we offer a range of other training programs in-house that are taught by our bench of certified trainers, including leadership development, soft-skill, and technical training and a variety of other learning opportunities from personal enrichment to deep skill-building workshops. Throughout the year, we host Development Days where we create a full day of training sessions and engaging opportunities for our people to learn and share their skills with others. We also encourage our people to learn on-the-job by signing up for our internal Gig Program, which matches individuals with short‐term development assignments that fulfill an emerging business need. 
To measure growth and success, all permanent employees receive structured performance reviews through Quarterly Conversations with their managers that focus on both performance evaluations and strategies for ongoing development. 
Recruiting the Best 
For Cornerstone, finding the best talent starts with having great recruiters. Similar to how we support our customers with recruiting solutions, we use our own technology to equip our recruiting team with the right tools to be successful. We provide our recruiters with a resource hub that features a wide variety of vital trainings to help them be successful, such as recruiting basics, process insights and best practices, unconscious bias training, behavioral-based interview training, referral program details, job marketing and creating an appealing job description, system utilization training, internal mobility, and diversity and inclusion. When our recruiters can be their best, job candidates and new hires can have a truly world-class experience. 
Internship Opportunities
We also value the opportunity to give people new to the business world the opportunity to learn and hone their skills. We offer several internship programs for undergraduates and graduate students at our offices around the world where we partner with programs like AIESEC, an international youth-run, not-for-profit organization that provides young people with leadership development, cross-cultural internships, and global volunteer exchange experiences to provide graduates with work experience. 
Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
We have prioritized building an inclusive culture that supports a diverse, engaged, and thriving workforce. Along with our Chief Diversity Officer, we have established a Diversity Leadership Council of employees to help advance diversity and inclusion across our company. We require employee training on diversity and inclusion, including unconscious bias training for all employees, as well as recurring training on our anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies.
To help recruit a diverse workforce, we review every position for diversity areas of focus. When conducting a search, we post jobs to a variety of diversity job boards and post to targeted, diverse communities. In combination with these extensive sourcing efforts we conduct: job description bias review, diverse interview panels, interview accommodation as needed, and unconscious bias training for hiring managers and interviewers.
Once hired, we encourage our people to explore our employee resource groups, called Cornerstar Resource Groups (“CRGs”), created by our employees and enabled by the company to effect change and successfully serve as advocates for inclusion and belonging. Each of our CRGs has at least one member who represents them on our Diversity Leadership Council to share their best practices, learn from each other, and identify ways to collaborate and support each other to ensure that our CRGs are helping our culture to thrive. 
To monitor the success of our diversity and inclusion programs and areas for improvement, we run quarterly diversity audits and provide our executives with reports about regional and functional diversity statistics on retention, promotion, and percentage of diverse representation.
Giving Our People a Voice
Giving our people the opportunity to provide feedback and voice their concerns is an important part of our culture. Not only do we conduct robust employee engagement surveys at least once a year, we also conduct periodic pulse surveys on specific engagement topics throughout the year. To promote an open feedback culture, we use our own product, Check-ins, collect feedback about our leaders, run 360 degree reviews, and offer an anonymous Speak Up hotline. 
Our COVID-19 Response
We believe we have a duty to safeguard the health of all our people and their families, our customers and visitors, and the community at large from infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) by providing and maintaining a safe workplace free of known hazards. We have implemented policies and practices that are designed to suppress the spread of the COVID-19 virus, such as flexible work-from-home options, social distancing, wearing approved face coverings, hand hygiene, telecommuting, and limiting travel. These safety measures are here to stay for the foreseeable future. 
Given how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the world, we regularly engage with our people about mental health awareness and focus on change resiliency while offering support through benefit providers, Employee Assistance Programs, a dedicated Mental Health Day, access to online gym solutions, and a COVID-19 Relief Fund for those severely financially impacted by the pandemic.
Proprietary Rights
To safeguard our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws in the US and in other jurisdictions and on contractual restrictions. We have confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers, distributors, and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information and software.
Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, creation of new suites, features, and functionality, collaboration with our customers, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Government Contracts
Many of our contracts with government agencies are subject to termination at the election of the government agency. While our government contracts generally do not provide for renegotiation of fees at the election of the government, it is possible that the government agency could request, and that we could under certain circumstances agree to, the renegotiation of the payments otherwise payable under such contracts. However, we have not in the past renegotiated significant payment terms under our government contracts. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Nature of Our Business—Our sales to government entities are subject to a number of additional challenges and risks.”
Seasonality
Our sales are seasonal in nature. We sign a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition, within a given quarter, we sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last two months of that quarter. Our agreements generally come up for renewal at the same time of the year they were originally signed, which further amplifies the seasonal nature of our sales.
The Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation
To demonstrate our commitment to empowering people and communities, we helped form the Cornerstone OnDemand Foundation (the “Foundation”) in 2010. The Foundation seeks to empower communities in the US and internationally by increasing the impact of the non-profit sector through the utilization of our people development solutions and capacity building programs.
The Foundation focuses its efforts on the areas of education, workforce development, and disaster relief. We have enlisted the help of our employees, customers, and distributors to support the Foundation in its efforts. The Foundation is designed to be self-sustaining over time through a variety of ongoing funding streams, such as donations, sponsorships, and distribution fees.
