ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
General
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2010 under the name “Advanced Ventures Corp.” Effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to “Gold Union Inc.” Effective March 26, 2018, we changed our name to Noble Vici Group, Inc. and our trading symbol was changed to NVGI. On August 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of Noble Vici Private Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Singapore (“NVPL”), which was wholly owned by Eldee Tang, our sole director and Chief Executive Officer. NVPL is engaged in the IoT, Big Data, Blockchain and E-commerce business. As a result of our acquisition of NVPL, we entered into the IoT, Big Data, Blockchain and E-commerce business. We are headquartered in Singapore. Certain of our resellers are operating “V-More” branded satellite offices in Shenzhen, China.
History
 
As Advanced Ventures Corp., we acquired a patent (U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209) (the “Patent”), for a catheter with a integral anchoring mechanism. During the second fiscal quarter of 2014, we elected to discontinue our business of exploiting the Patent and began to consider other business opportunities that may bring quicker and greater value to our stockholders. We initially considered entering into the business of trading precious metal bullion primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to “Gold Union Inc.” to more adequately reflect our initial intended business operations.
 
Effective March 7, 2012, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to three billion shares (3,000,000,000) and engaged in a forward stock split of our common shares whereby each one share of our common stock was split into fifteen shares of our common stock.
 
On December 31, 2015, we consummated a Share Exchange Agreement with G.U. International Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and our wholly owned subsidiary (“GUI”), and Kao Wei-Chen, an individual representing herself and 8 other individuals (collectively, the “Golden Corridor Shareholders”), which agreement was amended several times to extend the closing date of the acquisition (collectively, the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we, through GUI, purchased 480 shares of Phnom Penh Golden Corridor Trading Co. Limited (the “GC Shares”), from 9 private Golden Corridor Shareholders, representing 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Golden Corridor. As consideration, we issued to the Golden Corridor Shareholders 2,500,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.002 per share, for an aggregate value of US $5,000,000.
 
As a result of our acquisition of the GC Shares, we ceased our metal bullion trading business and entered into the real estate development and rental business located in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Golden Corridor owns three parcels of land located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom of Cambodia, measuring an aggregate of 172,510 square meters (collectively, the “Properties”). We intended to develop the Properties into an industrial park for rental income.
 
Due to difficulties in entering the real estate development and rental business, on February 2, 2018, we engaged in a corporate reorganization and distributed the GC Shares to our shareholders. On March 18, 2018, our subsidiary, G.U. Asia Limited was dissolved.
 
Change in Control to Current Business
 
On January 29, 2018, Eldee Tang entered into Share Sale Agreements with Kao Wei-Chen and three other shareholders and former affiliates of the Company to purchase up to 1,675,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share purchase price of US$0.00008, for an aggregate price of US$134,000. On June 15, 2018, the Company effectuated a 1 for 1,000 reverse stock split whereby every 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were reduced to one share. The parties effectuated Mr. Tang’s purchase of 750,000 shares such securities (expressed on a post reverse split basis) effective June 15, 2018. Mr. Tang hopes to purchase the balance of the 925,000 shares from Kao Wei-Chen, an affiliate of the Company, in the future. The foregoing description of the Share Sale Agreement with Kao Wei-Chen is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Quarterly Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

It is our understanding that Mr. Mok is not a U.S. Person within the meaning of Regulations S. The TDA Shares were sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation S promulgated thereunder.
 
On September 17, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in Noble Digital Apps Sendirian Berhad, a private limited company organized under the laws of Malaysia (“NDA”), and a start-up digital apps and big data company in accordance with the terms of that certain Share Exchange Agreement by and among the Company, NIA, NDA, Cheng Bok Woon, Tan Yew Fui, and Yong Swee Sun (“the “NDA Share Exchange Agreement”).

Our Operations and Future Plans
 
Ecommerce Platform
 
We are focused on providing users with innovative tools to live and interact in the modern mobile world through our ecosystem of IoT, Big Data, Blockchain and E-commerce products and services. We integrate blockchain technology with our E-commerce platform to connect consumers and merchants in a dynamic global marketplace via blockchain transactions. We onboard users, consumers and referrers through our Affiliate Incentivized Marketing to Advertising Dollar Sharing (formerly known as Affiliate Incentivized Marketing (AIM)) model while merchants are onboarded via our Merchant Incentivized Marketing (MIM) model. Some products and services offered in our ecosystem include procurement of discounted goods and services, referral reward system, mobile games and digital marketing, financial markets apps and a “Business Centre” within the same app. Our E-commerce platform not only offers users the ability to make online purchases, but also the convenience of an O2O (Online to Offline) platform whereby consumers can transact at a discount online while goods and services are distributed at a physical location. This drives traffic to the already weakened retail industry. The Business Centre within our ecosystem is offered through a mobile app and allows users to create their own referral platform within our ecosystem.
Advertising Dollar Sharing (ADS) 
 
We have rebranded our Affiliate Incentivized Marketing to Advertising Dollar Sharing. Similar to the AIM model, the ADS business model also involves driving online and physical traffic and increasing sales and marketing of targeted products and services. Its enhanced function includes distribution of advertising dollars via ADS system to agencies, affiliate marketers, advertiser, users and referrals.
Sale and Distribution of IoT Smart Devices / VMore System Private Limited
 
In addition to the E-commerce platform, we intend to focus on the sales and distribution of IoT smart devices and appliances. In September, 2019, we began to sell our first IoT appliance, our smart coffee dispensing machines (the V-More Express (“VX”)). Our initial plans of beginning machine distribution on or about the third calendar quarter of 2020 were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently monitoring the situation and hope to begin machine distribution and their progressive operation in Singapore once the economy begins to return to normalcy. We hope to derive income from sales of our VX IoT hardware, the core consumables in VX and the advertising services we provide to our customers in connection with the VX.
 
Features of the VX; Revenue Sources:
 
Machine Capacity: The VX offers 9 types of beverages, holds 60 liters of distilled water tank and is able to produce 400 cups of beverages. VX currently offers barista-grade coffee in 9 different varieties in both hot and ice options. VX can be modified to allow for other offerings to be sold. We expect to adopt regional pricing for core products sales, aligning to each specific market’s demand and supply.
 
AdTech: In addition to sales of core products, we expect to rely on advertisements placed through the VX to drive revenue. We intend to seek advertisers that are proximate to each specific VX to display their advertisements through our smart machine. We believe that the use of local advertisements (Proximate Location Ads, or PLA) will drive relevant traffic to nearby physical merchants as well as online merchants. Advertisements can be static or dynamic and may be interactive, allowing user interaction. We expect to provide services to advertisers to assist them in creating and placing effective ads in the VX.
 
Smart Technology: The VX features a 42 inch touch screen with Smart Digital Panel Advertising Technology (“SDPAT”) that allows users to interact with advertisements via its interactive touch screen. Through the VX, we hope to capture users’ spending behaviour, advertisement interactions and other quantitative data, while developing our Big Data analytics. Data from our machines can be integrated with our ecommerce platform to facilitate the offering of discounts, rewards or other products and services across our e-commerce platform. We believe that additional data will allow us to: (i) deliver and improve our offerings and services of our online VMore E-commerce platform; (ii) improve synergy with offline merchants; (iii) improve the efficacy of our advertising services; and (iv) improve sales of products offered by the VX.

VX Operations
 
Our VX business operations are segregated into the following core functions to address the needs of our advertisers, VX IoT hardware purchasers and consumers.
 
Sales and Marketing Team. Our team will focus on the sale of the VX IoT hardware. Its targeted industries are primarily from real estate and property owners such as commercial offices, retails and buildings, where the VX will be installed. In addition to the sale of VX, the team will also create brand awareness of the VX and its core offerings in the VX.
Advertiser Onboarding Team. Once an advertiser engages us online to have its advertisement placed in VX, a member of our advertiser onboarding team will initiate the first of several communications with the merchant to introduce the advertiser to the technology involved in our PLA ecosystem. Before the advertisement goes live on the VX, the team will work with the advertiser to build and create the advertisement. We will provide tools such as an app to ensure the advertisement traffic monitoring and management are aligned. All advertisements will be proximate locality based, ensuring relevance for targeted traffic to be driven.
 
Operation and Maintenance Team(O&M). Once the VX are deployed, O&M team will monitor the performance of each VX deployed for its ingredients supply, hardware status and data collection efficiency. Maintenance of the hardware for performance to prevent downtime and refilling the ingredients into the VX will be undertaken by the O&M team.
 
Customer/User Service Representatives. Our customer service representatives will be reachable via the app or email 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The customer service team will also work with our technology team to improve the experience of VX owners, consumers and advertisers on the mobile application based on their feedback.
Technology. We employ technology to improve the experience we offer to VX owners, users and advertisers, increase the rate at which our users use our V-More Pro platform and enhance the efficiency of our business operations. A component of our strategy is to continue developing and refining our technology. With the future use of blockchain technology for recording and collecting data, we believe the security of transactional records will be increased, protecting the accuracy of data held by VX owners, advertisers and users. We believe that basing transactional data on a private blockchain network will facilitate a smoother and faster transaction completion.
 
We expect to use an algorithm to analyze data collected through our VX ecosystem. As the volume of transactions grow organically through increased deployment of VXs, we expect to increase the amount of data that we can collect and analyze. We believe that such data will allow us to continue to improve the experience of our VX owners, advertisers and consumers which, in turn, will help us improve the way the ecosystem flows.
 
Cybersecurity. We have integrated our technology with encryption algorithm “SHA3-256” & RSA Public/Private-Key, which is designed to withstand timing attacks. It also accepts any 32-byte string as a valid public key and does not require validation. We believe that the security of transaction records within our current system is adequate.
Advertising Dollar Sharing (ADS). We believe our ADS model will allow users and advertisers to benefit from reduced costs to consumers and higher traffic for advertisers. We expect users to benefit from discounts and advertising dollar rebates offered through our PLA ecosystem from online and offline merchants, referrals, and internal marketing efforts, with advertisers benefitting from increased retail sales volume offline or online.
Core Product/User Scale. We hope to include other products from mass market merchants, such as food and other beverages, as part of our product and service offerings. We believe that outreach to the mass market will be more effective to drive traffic for the advertisers/merchants where simple to complex transactions can be achieved through adoption of an incentivized model.

Brand. A substantial portion of our VX owners, advertisers and users are acquired through agencies, word-of-mouth & social network/platforms. We believe that relying on the referral process, in turn, will improve the quality of our user base, advertisers and VX owners as well as brand awareness. We expect that higher confidence in our brand will facilitate acquiring more users, advertisers and VX owners for our ecosystem.
 
We operate our IoT Smart Device business through VMore System Private Limited (formerly, “ToroV System Private Limited”), our wholly owned subsidiary (“VSPL”). VSPL was incorporated in Singapore on July 22, 2019, and operates with our subsidiary AIM System Private Limited (“ASPL”), a Singapore private limited corporation incorporated on April 1, 2019, as described below:
 

· | VSPL – engages in sales and marketing of VX and barista grade coffee to owners and consumers, operates and maintains the VX including support, both technical and non-technical; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ASPL – engages in VX software technology integration; Proximate Location Ads (“PLA”) activities such as advertisement sales, build, create and deploy its proprietary software technology (“PropST”); distribute advertising dollars via an Advertising Dollar Sharing (“ADS”) system to agencies, affiliate marketers, advertisers, users and referrals; provide technical and non-technical support in relation to PLA; and engages in brand management, marketing, promotions and media engagement activities.

 
VX vendor
 
We expect to rely on Barista Uno Private Limited (“BUPL”) to provide VSPL with VX IoT hardware and coffee sourcing, distribution, and logistical upstream and downstream fulfilment services. Eldee Tang, our Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer, Interim Secretary and Director owns 31% of BUPL. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore has enacted heightened measures since April 7, 2020, that have restricted movement in people, goods and services for most businesses in Singapore. As a result, we our sales operations for VX related offerings were materially and adversely impacted. Our expected recovery timeline will depend on the policies of the Singapore Government moving forward, such as lifting of the movement restriction measures. We expect such impact to continue at least throughout the balance of calendar year 2021.
 
Other Initiatives
 
We are generally pursuing a plan of expansion and hope to achieve revenue growth through mass adoption by users and merchants of our platform/ecosystem. We seek to increase our user and merchant base through user incentive programs and brand awareness marketing programs, among other things. We expect to focus on users and merchants located in China and the Asia Pacific region in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully grow our revenues in the future, if ever.
 
Effective May 27, 2021, we granted Accell Technologies, Inc. (“ATI”) an exclusive license to use, market and sell our E-commerce Aggregator, Reward, AIM and AdTech system (“System”) in North America and South America for a period of 10 years (the “ATI License Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the ATI License Agreement, ATI is obligated to pay a royalty fee of 10% of gross revenues, not to exceed 20% of EBITDA on a per country basis in addition to other set up and software maintenance fees. ATI completed its evaluation of our System, and we expect ATI to complete the general software requirements specification (“SRS”) submission during the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2021. The foregoing description of the ATI License Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.15 to this Annual Report.
 
Effective June 25, 2021, we appointed Greatsolutions Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation, (“GSP”) to serve as our authorized distributor of our new biodegradable waste recycling machine for the territory of Singapore in accordance with the terms of that certain Authorized Distributor Agreement (the “Authorized Distributor Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Authorized Distributor Agreement, agreed to purchase 100 units of our machines as well as other related products and pay a license fee of One Million Dollars for the first year of the term. The term of the Authorized Distributor Agreement will begin upon the successful commission of the first machine in Singapore. We are in the process of working with the relevant governmental agencies to have the machines commissioned for use in Singapore. As of the date of this Annual Report, we received $100,000 as a portion of the license fee. The foregoing description of the Authorized Distributor Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.16 to this Annual Report.

Near-Term Requirements For Additional Capital
 
For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business efforts and any future acquisitions through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions. We have not yet generated sufficient revenues. We expect to incur operating losses over the next twelve months until we have made substantial deployment of our VX machines and also increased our business operations. We continue to seek new partnerships regionally or acquire fully operating company in relation to VX operation and maintenance (“O&M”) and VX regional sales. There can be no assurance that that we will be successful in consummating a business partnership or acquisition or that such partnership or business will be successful after acquisition.
Intellectual Property
 
We continue to own the rights, title and interests in Patent for a receptacle catheter with integral anchoring means, which Patent is associated with our former business. The Patent was issued on September 1, 2004 and will expire on September 6, 2022. We do not expect to exploit this Patent in the near future.

As of June 20, 2021, we have the following employees:

We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees and have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in any labor disputes.
