ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 
CROE, Inc. is an early stage fitness apparel company with the mission of creating supportive, protective, and innovative sports bras and fitness apparel. We were incorporated on December 2, 2013 in the state of Utah by our principal executive Deborah Thomas. Our business office and mailing address is 11650 South State Street, Suite 240, Draper, Utah 84020, and our telephone number is (801) 816-2522. Our website is www.croefit.com and is not part of this prospectus.
Business
 
Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include: (i) formation of the Company; (ii) development of our business plan; (iii) development of our water and radio-wave resistant sportsbra pocket ("CROENest") and other apparel;(iv) development of our brand; (v) and marketing and sales of CROEhats and jewelry. We have not completed development of our CROENest and other apparel and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing the development.
 
From our inception on December 2, 2013, until the present, we have had limited operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had no revenues and have operated through a combination of related party loans and the sale of our common stock. We have used all proceeds from the loans and the offering for working capital.
 
Our Vision
 
Our goal is to help people to fearlessly pursue their passions finding great purpose in living them. We intend to provide products that will help with this endeavor in many ways. Our team is developing a product that every runner, cyclist and active person may want. It is being created to be functional, and protective at the same time.
 
Consistent with CROE’s philosophy of encouraging individuals to pursue their passions, the company is dedicated to supporting and promoting causes in the areas of health, education, and athletics. With the resources acquired through business expansion, CROE is committed to assisting individuals and communities achieve a higher quality of life through these three areas.
 
Products
 
CROE was created in 2013 to protect the athlete on the inside and the outside through its unique fitness clothing. With developing technology the founders of CROE have developed fitness apparel and devices that are unique in the marketplace.
 
Due to concerns in relation to the epidemic of breast cancer, and several studies that have cast doubt on the prevailing belief that cell phone radiation is “generally safe”, we have taken measures to make sure that our products provide the maximum protection for women from potentially harmful cell phone radiation.

The creators of CROE are athletes that were looking for ways to improve their running, and cycling experiences. After ruining many cell phones because of moisture from sweat they put their ideas together and created the CROENest. The CROENest was developed to function as a pocket that securely holds your cell phone while you are exercising. It not only holds your phone securely next to your body but it does it in a water proof “nest” that is also 99.9% radiation proof protecting your breasts from the harmful effects of cell phone radiation. It also has a separate pocket for cash, credit card, I.D and a small pocket to carry chap stick that is also sun screen and a smudge stick to prevent chaffing.
 
The pocket also has an area for a tiny phone charger we are in the process of developing that is a charger giving your phone an extra 10 to 12 hours of charge on one side and on the other it is runner’s mace! This gives you the peace of mind while running out doors that you will always have phone battery and protection from harm.

 Market
 
The national athletic apparel market continues to dominate the U.S. retail segment of the economy. According to the New York Times, athletic and sports footwear made up about $21 billion dollars of the $63 billion dollar sporting goods market in 2015. Internationally, sports apparel and footwear sales have jumped 42% to $270 billion over the past seven years.

According to a new report by Allied Market Research titled, "World Sports Apparel - Market Opportunities and Forecasts, 2016-2020", the world sports apparel market is expected to generate revenue of $184.6 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 4.3% during the forecast period, 2015-2020. Growing health awareness, increasing disposable income and a surge in female participation in sports are the major factors driving the growth of the world sports apparels market.
 
The sports apparel market is categorized, based on end users, into apparels for men, women and kids. The men segment dominates the world sports apparel market, constituting around 52% of the total market revenue. The women segment is the second biggest contributor, expected to grow at a relatively higher CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period, on account of the growing interest and participation of women in different sports activities.
 
Due to the extreme growth in athletic apparel, a significant number of start-ups are getting into the business. However, most lack the relationships, experience and resources to be successful. One of the most daunting challenges any company faces is being able to manufacture, produce and effectively market their products for their product sales initiatives. We believe that CROE has the relationships, experience, and resources to do just that.
 
Competition
 
The athletic apparel industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control, including the timely development and introduction of our athletic clothing and its enhancements, its functionality, performance, reliability, customer service and support and marketing efforts. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the textiles market, we expect additional competition from other emerging companies. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to fashion changes and have greater resources for the development and promotion of their products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had two employees. Our chief executive officer and director, Deborah Thomas oversees our day to day operations and product development. Our secretary and Director Elliot Polatoff, oversees our financial matters. CROE uses the services of various contract personnel from time to time. We intend to hire additional employees and independent contractors on an as needed basis. Although national unemployment rates remain high relative to historical averages, there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the athletic apparel industry. Nevertheless, we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
