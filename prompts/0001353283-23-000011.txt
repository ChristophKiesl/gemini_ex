Overview
Splunk helps customers build a safer and more resilient digital world. We deliver innovative solutions that enable organizations to harness the value of their data to help keep their digital systems secure, available and performant. As organizations’ reliance on resilient systems continues to increase, it is critical that they keep pace with increasing complexity and potential vulnerabilities associated with these systems. Our solutions for security and observability empower Security Operations (“SecOps”), IT Operations (“ITOps”), and Development Operations (“DevOps”) teams to maintain resilient systems by monitoring and securing them more quickly and efficiently. We also believe our offerings empower operational transformation, helping customers move from reactive, non-scalable and ineffective approaches to proactive, automated, and machine learning (“ML”)-assisted processes that drive better outcomes even as the scale and complexity of their technology continue to grow.
We believe that the increasing reliance on digital systems has made the resilience of these systems mission-critical for nearly every organization and the sustained ongoing importance of digital systems amidst the evolving threat landscape further elevates Splunk’s central role in enabling secure and reliable operations for our customers.

The solutions that comprise our Splunk Security and Splunk Observability products are powered by the Splunk platform - an extensible, configurable platform that supports expansive data collection and instrumentation, at scale. The Splunk platform provides a wide range of interfaces for administrators, data engineers, analysts, and end users for data preparation, investigation, and visualization. Organizations can also execute unified search queries across datasets in multiple Splunk instances - on-premise and in the cloud - as well as third party data stores. Extensive ML capabilities, including out-of-the-box algorithms optimized for common data types, deliver more accurate and actionable insights. Pre-built ML algorithms and model development capabilities allow data scientists to develop and deploy customized algorithms and models to their custom security and observability use cases. 
In addition, our field organization, partners and customers build content on Splunk to address a broader range of security and observability use cases, extending the power of Splunk, and accelerating time to value for customers. 
We believe that Splunk’s Unified Security and Observability Platform offers a unique breadth and depth of capabilities which delivers best in class outcomes for customers. With Splunk, SecOps, ITOps and DevOps teams get industry analyst recognized, market-leading security and observability solutions. Splunk also helps drive better alignment and collaboration across these teams, thereby simplifying detection, investigation and response. 
Our products are designed to give organizations comprehensive data visibility from across their on-premise, cloud and edge data sources with full fidelity, at scale. Combined with the tools for rapid detection, investigation and response, organizations are able to respond more quickly and accurately, reducing mean time to detect (“MTTD”) and mean time to respond (“MTTR”). Splunk also enables organizations to create process and cost efficiencies by optimizing the collection, distribution and storage of data, reducing data duplication, and simplifying data reuse across multiple use cases for security and observability. 
Splunk products are delivered as either cloud services or on-premise licensed software (“license offerings”) that customers deploy in their own environments. We believe that the unique capabilities, rapid delivery, and streamlined adoption that cloud services enable make them the best delivery model for us and the majority of our customers. Accordingly, we will deliver a growing number of our offerings as cloud services to take full advantage of cloud capabilities like elastic scalability while maximizing the rate at which new features are released and adopted.
Splunk Security
Splunk Security helps SecOps leaders mitigate cyber risk and comply with regulatory requirements, while enabling them to streamline security operations, increase productivity, prevent analyst fatigue and accelerate threat detection investigation and response (“TDIR”). Splunk Security reduces alert noise, replaces swivel-chair security management with one common security work surface, and automates manual and repetitive tasks. SecOps leaders leverage Splunk Security to establish modern data-centric security operations centers that improve every aspect of TDIR and maximize return on security investments. Customers use Splunk Security to address a wide range of use cases including: 
Security monitoring Enhance the coverage of potential attack vectors and analyze a continuous stream of near-real-time data for threats and other potential security issues. With comprehensive data visibility across on-premise, cloud and edge, SecOps teams can investigate and analyze alerts and incidents for faster detection and response. 
Incident management Quickly investigate threats and gain an understanding of incidents. Built-in advanced analytics detect suspicious patterns and categorizes them by potential severity, so SecOps teams can focus on the critical incidents. Rapid search capabilities with automated out-of-the-box content, aligned with industry frameworks, accelerates investigation and response times. 
Threat hunting Analyze malicious activities and determine the scope of incidents, faster. SecOps teams can leverage Splunk’s searches across petabytes of data to perform in-depth threat hunting and analysis. Splunk also provides continually updated out-of-the-box detections, integrated threat intelligence, and ML models that accurately detect, contextualize and prioritize known and unknown threats by organizational risk.
Advanced and insider threat detection Discover abnormalities and unknown threats that remain undetected by traditional security tools through early and rapid behavior-based analysis. Risk-based alerting and streaming analytics enables attributing risk to users and systems, map alerts to cybersecurity frameworks and trigger alerts when risk exceeds thresholds. 
Compliance Centralize cyber-hygiene initiatives and the operational overhead needed to demonstrate adherence to compliance requirements and accelerate incident response investigation efforts. Splunk provides a highly efficient and secure solution, with real-time posture and insights across IT resources and security controls to clear compliance and pass audits with minimal effort, regardless of mandate or regulatory framework.
Automation and orchestration Provide security operations centers advanced orchestration, automation and response capabilities by integrating teams, processes and tools. SecOps teams can hunt, detect, investigate, manage, contain and remediate threats from a unified security operations platform, enabling faster investigation and response. 
Splunk Observability
Splunk Observability provides real-time performance monitoring and analysis of infrastructure, application, digital customer experiences and business services, based on open standards and instrumentation. With Splunk, ITOps and DevOps teams gain full control of their data, analyze in full-fidelity and avoid vendor lock-in. Built-in guided root cause analysis helps teams reduce MTTD/MTTR and prevent issues prior to impacting customers. Splunk Observability enables IT and business stakeholders to understand how their business is performing in real-time. With Splunk Observability, ITOps and DevOps teams 
can quickly resolve issues, improve reliability on an ongoing basis and make smarter business decisions. Customers use Splunk Observability to address a range of use cases including: 
Proactive outage prevention ML-driven alerting uses dynamic and custom data thresholds, and the live status of business service key performance indicators (“KPI”) to forecast how a business service will perform in the short term. This enables ITOps teams to get ahead of potential customer impacting outages and helps them ensure better service reliability. 
Service Monitoring to Align IT with the Business Services oriented monitoring and executive dashboards enable ITOps teams to show their impact on business outcomes. ITOps and business leaders can better align by leveraging a single, up-to-the-minute view of how critical services are performing with dedicated service and KPI health scores. 
Alert noise reduction Leverage Splunk ML capabilities to group and prioritize alerts from across multiple data sources. ITOps teams can thus quickly prioritize alerts in terms of impact, significantly reduce alert noise, thus fixing performance issues faster. 
Log analytics for IT troubleshooting ITOps can aggregate log data from multiple sources and domains at massive scale, with full fidelity. This enables teams to troubleshoot application and business service issues from a single source of truth for logs, accelerating investigation and response.
Extend visibility from on-premises to the cloud DevOps teams moving workloads to the cloud gain visibility across on-premises, and cloud-native environments. By using telemetry data that is already sent to Splunk (logs) alongside new types of telemetry data that are commonly used in clouds (metrics and traces) in the same dashboards and workflows, DevOps teams gain insight into their hybrid cloud environments.
Isolate problems in cloud native environments Cloud-native environments introduce unmatched scale and complexity that traditional monitoring tools cannot handle, and that make it difficult for DevOps teams to troubleshoot when an issue occurs. Splunk Observability processes in real-time all the telemetry data and uses ML-guided workflows to help DevOps teams quickly and confidently detect, troubleshoot, and isolate issues faster.
Understand business impact of changes Deploying frequent code changes increases the risk for new errors, latency, or outages that can impact service performance, customer experience, and business outcomes. With Splunk Observability, DevOps teams can understand how each change impacts the business, and prioritize any issues that may arise by business importance. DevOps can more confidently deploy new changes and improvements to customers faster than ever, thereby creating more business value.
Empower developers & site reliability engineers with self-service observability Splunk Observability enables DevOps teams to easily monitor and troubleshoot their applications, while adhering to centralized policies. Our solutions empower them to use open standards to send telemetry data with minimal effort, get out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts based on industry best practices, and efficiently work together for faster troubleshooting. The built-in access and usage controls enable organizations to maintain operational efficiency and safeguard sensitive data. 
Customer and Partner Solutions
Splunk provides application programming interfaces (“API”), software development kits (“SDK”), and other interfaces that enable our network of third-party developers, partners, and customers to build content that configures and extends our solutions to accommodate specific use cases. This range of content includes pre-built data inputs, workflows, searches, reports, alerts, custom dashboards, flexible user interface components, custom data visualizations, and integration actions and methods. Content can be built for a customer’s or partner’s own internal use, or it can be made generally available for download, in free or premium offerings, from within the Unified Splunk Security and Observability Platform, and via Splunkbase, an online community and marketplace for developers, partners, and customers to share apps and add-ons. Over 2,800 apps and add-ons are currently available on Splunkbase, most of which are built and maintained by third parties. These apps and add-ons help drive faster time-to-value, and simplify extending the power of Splunk to address more security and observability use cases.
We do not receive any material revenues from the sale of apps or add-ons by third-party application providers. Many apps and add-ons posted to Splunkbase are provided at no additional cost to users. Partner apps and add-ons listed on Splunkbase that are not free are primarily licensed directly by the third-party to the end user.

Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our growth strategy are: 
Continued adoption of our cloud services Cloud services represent an important source of growth for Splunk and our partners. Our existing cloud services customers have accelerated their time to value and achieved lower total cost of ownership as compared to our license offerings. Given our existing customers’ success adopting our cloud services offerings, we will continue to invest heavily in acquiring new cloud services customers and will support existing license customers’ migrations to our cloud services offerings.
Customer-driven delivery model We believe customers will continue to have a mix of deployments across their business: on-premise, hybrid, cloud, and multi-cloud, and in order for them to achieve digital resilience, they need full visibility into those diverse environments. Our ability to offer solutions that span on-premise and cloud is a competitive advantage to Splunk as we enable customers to gain visibility and increase their digital resilience regardless of where they are on their cloud journey. As such, we will continue to invest in our license offerings to enable both standalone consumption and hybrid Splunk deployments that span customer on-premises and cloud environments to serve our customers.
Expand the Splunk value proposition with broader and deeper capabilities We will continue to focus our product strategy and go-to-market approaches on users of Splunk Security and Splunk Observability and we will expand the Splunk platform that serves them. We intend to deliver new and enhanced capabilities, as well as services that provide faster time-to-value and easier adoption and expansion. We also plan to deliver new features tailored to meet the specific needs of users, including more comprehensive data reach, more powerful analytics, and ML automation capabilities. While we are focused on extending our industry analyst-recognized leadership across security and observability, our customers benefit from even greater value when multiple organizations are generating insights using the Splunk platform.
Global Expansion We continue to invest in go-to-market, operations and infrastructure to deliver our services to customers in targeted countries across multiple geographies. Splunk has had success in global expansion as evidenced by our increased mix of revenues outside of the U.S., and we continue to see this as a significant growth opportunity.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our offerings, develop new end-market specific solutions and apps, conduct software and quality assurance testing and improve our core technology. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on an ongoing basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing offerings. We enhance and expand our offerings based on customer feedback, our own research and development efforts and through acquisitions and investments. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that can accelerate the delivery of new capabilities, entry into new market segments and our technical expertise.
Intellectual Property
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, internal policies and contractual provisions to protect our technology and intellectual property rights. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the jurisdiction in which such right arises. We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We file trademark, patent, and copyright applications to protect our intellectual property.
Generally, we retain ownership of software we develop. All software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code or as a cloud service pursuant to browser-wrap, embedded or on-line license or services terms, or signed customer agreements. These agreements generally contain restrictions on duplication, disclosure, reverse engineering, transfer and license circumvention. 
We use open source software in our offerings and business, including as incorporated into software we receive from third party commercial software vendors or technologies obtained through acquisitions, and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Additionally, we, including companies that we have acquired, have intentionally made certain proprietary software available on an open source basis, both by contributing modifications back to existing open source projects, and by making certain internally developed tools available pursuant to open source licenses, and we plan to continue to do so in the future. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategies are closely aligned to expand market awareness, generate our sales pipeline, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth and enablement for adoption and customer success. 
Sales
We sell our offerings directly through field and inside sales and indirectly through different routes to market with a community of partners. These partners include but are not limited to leading, global service integrators, managed services partners, and resellers. We gather prospects through a broad range of marketing campaigns, programs and events. Our sales development teams handle lead qualifications. Large or complex transactions generally are handled by our globally distributed direct field sales teams. Our sales engineers help define customer use cases, pre-sales qualification and evaluation.
Our field sales teams are organized geographically across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). We also have a dedicated sales team focused on public sector customers, which includes United States federal, state and local government entities, colleges and universities, and not-for-profits.
In addition to acquiring new customers, our sales teams are responsible for securing renewals of existing contracts, as well as increased adoption of our offerings by existing customers. To accomplish this, our field sales and customer success teams work closely with our customers to ensure adoption and overall account health, which fosters expanded usage through higher capacity or upgrades and additional use cases.
Marketing
We focus our marketing efforts on generating opportunities for our sales team and partners, increasing awareness of the Splunk brand, driving widespread adoption, and communicating product advantages and business benefits. We market our offerings as targeted solutions for specific use cases and as an enterprise solution for a broad range of data and use cases. We engage with existing and potential customers to provide community-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our products by these customers. We utilize business press, technology press, industry analysts and influential voices to create awareness for Splunk in our target markets. We host a number of events across our sales regions to engage with both existing customers and new prospects, as well as deliver product training. We host our annual user conference, “.conf” and multiple partner forums as other ways to support the Splunk community to foster collaboration and help our customers drive further business results. 
Partner Network
Splunk’s partner ecosystem creates solutions focused on customer business outcomes by delivering impactful, multi-dimensional solutions across industries and regional theaters. Partners can untap new markets, customers, and data streams with new product innovations. We believe establishing a culture of co-innovation that drives repeatability is foundational to making Splunk broadly available. As such, Splunk shifted the focus to partners that deliver value through building, selling, advising, servicing and delivering managed services to drive higher partner and customer adoption across our offerings. The new Splunk Partnerverse program anchors our partner strategy. Splunk Partnerverse builds on Splunk’s global brand, expands our customer reach through partners, and reinforces Splunk as both cloud-ready and partner friendly. There are three program objectives:
•Serve all Splunk partners through one program that enables and promotes a cloud-first partner network
•Differentiate partners in the market through Splunk Partnerverse badging that recognizes a partner’s training, expertise, and repeatable success across multiple industries and solutions
•Amplify Splunk partners’ validated expertise and Splunk-based offerings via the Partner Solutions Catalog and Splunkbase so that customers can easily find the right partners
Splunk organized its partner strategy to align and support all partner types with a focus on the connected ecosystem and partner-centric routes to market:
Cloud service providers (“CSP”) Strong partnerships with CSPs (e.g., Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud) are the cornerstone of our cloud services. The online storefront known as a cloud marketplace offers customers an alternate way to conduct transactions. Today our marketplace business is driven primarily by customer demand and we will meet our customers where and how they want to buy. We are coordinating product development, sales efforts, and ongoing marketing efforts with these key partners to promote our products running on a CSP’s infrastructure.
Global systems integrators and managed services providers These partners support planning, implementation, and management of end-to-end business solutions tailored to specific customers, segments, and industry verticals. We focus on full-stack market solutions that partners manage to ensure our customers have access to the best expertise, technology, and solutions for optimal performance, security, and technology operations. We are working with this partner set to develop and deploy Splunk platform-based solutions to their customers, extending our overall market reach and total addressable market. We further intend to establish select core business groups to increase our joint selling opportunities, explore new solutions, and promote Splunk’s strength in Security and Observability.
Splunk Community Engagement
We engage with the community of Splunk users, including Splunk employees, partners, and customers, through a variety of online and in-person forums to assist with Splunk skills development. Additionally, our engagement with users empowers the development of Customer and Partner solutions, drives cross-pollination of experiences and best practices, and provides feedback on current and planned future offerings and capabilities. 
Our primary online forums include Splunk Answers, Splunk User Groups, and Splunk Ideas. In Splunk Answers, users share best practices about how to build searches, create data visualizations, build implementations to address specific use-cases and configure and deploy our cloud services and license offerings. While our product, support, engineering and professional services teams participate in Splunk Answers, the majority of questions appearing on Splunk Answers are answered by other Splunk users, including the SplunkTrust, a peer-nominated, MVP group of Splunk users. Splunk Ideas is a forum through which the community can submit and vote on ideas for new product offerings and capabilities, providing a highly-refined set of inputs to our product development efforts. We also maintain active communities on leading social internet platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Slack.

Competition
Our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive with an increasing number of vendors competing across product areas. For example, security vendors are attempting to penetrate the observability industry, observability competitors are targeting the security space, competitors across the security and observability siloes are expanding their footprints in log management and machine data space, and CSPs are extending their native operations and security capabilities across competing cloud environments. Additionally, a number of more domain-focused competitors continue to target specific use cases within the application, IT and security domains in an attempt to drive rapid penetration.
These dynamics position us in competition with a variety of large CSPs and software vendors, as well as smaller specialized companies, open source projects and custom development efforts, which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include: 
•Cloud monitoring and APM/Observability vendors;
•Monitoring, troubleshooting, security and analytics services offered (embedded or add-ons) by major public CSPs;
•Legacy security, systems management and other IT vendors; and
•IT departments that undertake custom software development efforts to analyze and manage their operations data across their public and private cloud landscapes.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Our board of directors works closely with management to oversee ESG, with each of our four board committees dedicated to areas of the program associated with their respective areas of responsibility. In fiscal 2023, we continued to integrate ESG across the business by implementing robust reporting systems, quality assurance and controls, and integrating cross-functional oversight of non-financial data and disclosures. This work lays the foundation for data-driven program management, metrics and disclosures. In terms of climate change, we have been intensely focused on developing our climate strategy since we announced our climate commitments near the end of fiscal 2022. We are assessing climate risks and opportunities, modeling climate scenarios, analyzing potential net zero transition pathways, and evaluating our second suite of science-based climate targets. Also in fiscal 2023, we published our second annual Global Impact Report, which covers the four priority areas that matter most to our stakeholders and the business: data responsibility, environmental sustainability, ethical and inclusive growth, and social impact.
Human Capital
Human capital management is foundational to the Ethical and Inclusive Growth pillar of our Global Impact Strategy. At the core of Splunk, we are a people-centric company. We believe that the best way to continue to deliver customer success and the best products and services is to focus on attracting and developing the most qualified candidates to join our team (based on skills, knowledge and abilities). In turn, Splunkers benefit from, and contribute to, a company culture that is inviting and equitable, and that fosters personal and career growth. 
We spend time and energy supporting, retaining and developing our high-performing and innovative employees. Our efforts are guided by three principle objectives: utilizing inclusive hiring systems and processes that minimize the potential for unconscious bias in decision-making; creating a work environment that promotes autonomy, learning, open communication and trust; and delivering workforce insights that help inform talent and business decisions. Twice a year, we conduct a global employee opinion and engagement survey to measure and assess our progress related to key aspects of the Splunker experience, especially employee engagement and satisfaction.
Our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (“DEIB”) is central to our core values. We strive to embrace each person’s unique individual value and the communities that matter to them. This commitment is an integral part of our DEIB program. As of January 31, 2023, we employed nearly 8,000 employees, of which approximately 70% were in the United States and 30% were in our international locations. 
Our Board has general oversight of the Company’s corporate culture and human capital management, both directly and through its standing committees. The Talent & Compensation Committee provides oversight of our DEIB program and talent and careers programs. The People Organization’s leadership team (which includes our Chief People Officer and our Chief Diversity Officer) manages our DEIB and talent and careers programs; the Chief Executive Officer and the executive leadership team oversee these efforts. Additional information on the oversight of human capital management matters can be found in our Proxy Statement. 
Having helped Splunk and Splunkers adapt to the dynamic changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic over the last few years, our Global Health & Safety team is focused on safe and healthy approaches to planning the pandemic-to-epidemic transition and managing the new realities of a distributed workforce where a portion of Splunkers work from offices, some from home, and others a blend of both.
Our most recent Global Impact Report, which contains additional information on our talent initiatives and employee engagement surveys, is available on our website.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
A diverse and inclusive company is essential to unlocking the full potential of our people, our culture and our business. Our company-wide inclusiveness effort, A Million Data Points, speaks powerfully to our holistic, multi-dimensional approach to diversity, illuminating cultural heritage, intersectionality, experiences and all the unique qualities and talents that each employee possesses. Our nine employee resource groups are central to our enterprise DEIB strategy, helping to build awareness and engagement at all levels of the organization to ensure that all Splunkers feel seen, safe, supported and able to do their best 
work and thrive in their careers. Splunk is focused on growing the representation rates of women and individuals from underrepresented groups at all levels of the organization, especially in leadership. We provide DEIB education and offerings to embed inclusion and equity in our critical talent systems and processes.
We work to help provide access to new careers in technology with skills development and training, promoting a new generation of diverse talent through a global network of universities, community colleges and workforce partners like YearUp and Hire Military. Splunk is regularly recognized as an employer of choice in the technology industry and within the various locations that we operate. 
Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found in our Diversity Annual Report posted on our website. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing
Splunk provides a comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits package to attract, retain and engage the talented employees that make our company successful. We provide employees with competitive base salaries, incentive compensation, as well as the opportunity to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase Splunk stock at a discount. Eligible employees receive equity awards in the form of restricted stock units.
Our benefits offerings are designed to meet the unique needs of our employees. We believe we provide competitive benefits in each local market we operate in to help our employees care for themselves and their families. Common offerings are health benefits, retirement benefits, fertility and family planning benefits, paid time off, holidays and leave benefits.
We offer a number of additional benefits to help our employees. These benefits include 30 days of paid time off that employees can use for any absence related to the pandemic or a natural disaster, four additional well-being paid rest days and reimbursement for certain expenses related to remote working. In addition, we have a global mental health offering through a third-party provider who gives our employees and their families access to counseling, personal coaches and a variety of digital wellness resources.
Development
We believe in leadership and learning and invest in the development of all our employees. Our vision is to further enhance our talent practices and leadership behaviors in order to empower more autonomous decision making, leverage data insights, reinforce open communication and feedback, and set clear rules of engagement to systemically foster increased trust and transparency. We are strongly committed to our responsibility of providing development and growth opportunities to our employees through greater emphasis on internal mobility and fair and equitable talent practices. Employees take advantage of live courses, leadership programs, online training, product training, sales training, technical training, mentor programs, team building events, seminars, conferences, lectures, university programs, peer-to-peer and manager-led training and other learning opportunities across the company.
