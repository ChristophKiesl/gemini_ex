ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” “our” and refer to PHP Ventures Acquisition Corp.
 
Overview 
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on April 13, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
 
We believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies we intend to focus on consumer-facing companies with a significant Africa presence or a compelling Africa potential, which complements the expertise of our management team. We will seek enterprises at the forefront of evolving preferences, tastes, experiences, and values that have the potential to offer a differentiated proposition that creates more meaning and connectivity to the modern consumer.
 
Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Choo Yeow Ngoh, who brings 15 years of experience in the business and entrepreneurship world building great consumer products and companies. Mr. Ngoh has experience dealing directly with relevant authorities, governments, and bureaucracies to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and standards. He has worked with numerous governments during the course of his career as an entrepreneur. He is familiar with many aspects of opening a foreign business in a new country, including obtaining government approvals for investment, work permits and other visa issues and obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of products.

The Company’s sponsor is Global Link Investment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 11, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 5,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000 (see Note 6) (the “Initial Public Offering”). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 270,900 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $2,709,000 (the “Private Placement”).
 
Subsequently, on August 19, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-allotment Option Units”). The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 750,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $7,500,000. On August 19, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 22,500 Placement Units, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. The Placement Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
A total of $58,075,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Offering and the proceeds of private placements that closed on August 16, 2021 and August 19, 2021, net of the underwriting commissions, discounts, and offering expenses, was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We believe that the consumer products and services sectors represent attractive target markets with promising business potential, along with a large number of potential acquisition opportunities. By 2025, the global market for consumer products and services sectors is expected to reach approximately $15.3 trillion. According to McKinsey & Company, spending by consumers and businesses in Africa will reach $5.6 trillion by 2025, up from $4 trillion in 2015. Africa’s fast-growing population and markets present important opportunities for business in an environment of relative slower global growth. At the same time, greater innovation and investment from business is essential to meet Africa’s unfulfilled demand for goods and services, close the gaps in its infrastructure, create jobs and decrease poverty.
 
Increasing internet access in Africa is also leading to a rapid emergence of e-commerce sites eager to tap into Africa’s growing online consumerism. Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa are currently at the forefront of this growth evolution. With the surge of internet penetration on the continent, many Africans are easing into the habit of shopping online. According to a McKinsey’s Lions Go Digital report, online shopping could account for up to 10% of retails sales (with a value of around US $75 billion) by 2025, as more Africans gain access to the internet.

Our Acquisition Criteria
 
To be clear, our focus is not to fund any particular business in Africa. Instead, the company is interested in businesses that meet the following criteria:

● | History of organic growth and attractive margins with opportunities to further enhance revenue growth and profitability through innovation, marketing investments (including digital) and productivity improvements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Recession and pandemic resistant, through essential everyday use products and services that offer a compelling price/value proposition; 
● | Beneficiary of increased outsourcing of critical, value-added services within the consumer sector; 
● | Extendable platforms via adjacent category launches and M&A; 
● | Omnichannel presence and/or opportunities; 
● | Strong, visionary management teams; and 
● | Orphan segments or brands deemed non-core or off-strategy by their corporate owners that could benefit greatly from increased focus and investment. 

Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to seek to determine a company’s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with management, consultations with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, in the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members of our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering and approving the transaction.
 
Members of our management team, including our officers and directors, will directly or indirectly own our securities following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors, as well as our management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.
 
We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
 
Each of our directors, director nominees and officers presently have and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.

Our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination and their respective participation in any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in respect of determining to which such company a particular business combination opportunity should be presented, particularly in the event there is overlap among the investment mandates of such companies. Additionally, one of our directors, Mr. Stein, has invested in other blank check companies. We do not believe Mr. Stein’s investments would affect our ability to identify and pursue business opportunities or complete our initial business combination.
 
Moreover, because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously and we are not limited by industry or geography in terms of the acquisition opportunities we can pursue, except with respect to our prohibition from seeking target acquisitions in China and Hong Kong. In addition, our founder, sponsor, officers, and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we complete one or more initial business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination.
 
If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business for the post-acquisition company to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

The net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the placement units released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above.
 
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsors, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, following this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account; or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares: (a) on any initial business combination, or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to: (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination from the closing of this offering, or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their public shares
