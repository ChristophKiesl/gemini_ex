ITEM 1. | Business

General
CONSOL Energy Inc., (CONSOL Energy or the Company) is an integrated energy company operated through two primary divisions, oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) and Pennsylvania (PA) Mining Operations. The E&P division is focused on Appalachian area natural gas and liquids activities, including production, gathering, processing and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin. The PA Mining Operations division is focused on the extraction and preparation of coal, also in the Appalachian Basin. 
CONSOL Energy was incorporated in Delaware in 1991, but its predecessors had been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864. CONSOL Energy entered the natural gas business in the 1980s initially to increase the safety and efficiency of our coal mines by capturing methane from coal seams prior to mining, which makes the mining process safer and more efficient. Over the past ten years, CONSOL Energy's natural gas business has grown by approximately 617% to produce 394.4 net Bcfe in 2016. This business has grown from coalbed methane production in Virginia into other unconventional production, including hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, in the Appalachian Basin. This growth was accelerated with the 2010 asset acquisition of the Appalachian Exploration & Production business of Dominion Resources, Inc. Subsequently, on December 5, 2013, we sold Consolidation Coal Company and certain subsidiaries, including five active coal mines in West Virginia. 
Our E&P division operates, develops and explores for natural gas primarily in Appalachia (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Virginia and Tennessee). Currently, our primary focus is the continued development of our Marcellus Shale acreage and the delineation and development of our Utica Shale acreage. We believe that our concentrated operating area, our legacy surface acreage position, our regional operating expertise, our extensive data set from development, joint ventures, non-operated participation wells, our held by production acreage position and our ability to coordinate gas drilling with coal mining activity gives us a significant operating advantage over our competitors. 
 Our land holdings in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale plays cover large areas, provide multi-year drilling opportunities and, collectively, have sustainable lower risk growth profiles. We currently control approximately 413,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale and approximately 683,000 net acres that have Utica Shale potential in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We also have approximately 2.2 million net acres in our coalbed methane play.
Highlights of our 2016 production include the following:

• | Total average production of 1,080,512 Mcfe per day, an increase of 20% over 2015;


• | 88% Natural Gas, 12% Liquids; and


• | 54% Marcellus, 23% Utica, 17% coalbed methane, and 6% other.

 At December 31, 2016, our proved natural gas, NGL, condensate and oil reserves (collectively, "natural gas reserves") had the following characteristics:

• | 6.3 Tcfe of proved reserves;


• | 93.2% natural gas;


• | 58.9% proved developed;


• | 87.6% operated; and


• | A reserve life ratio of 15.85 years (based on 2016 production).

Highlights of coal activities in 2016 include the following:

• | Production of 24.6 million tons of coal;


• | Coal reserve holdings of 2.4 billion tons; and


• | 75% of coal sales to domestic utilities.

Additionally, we provide energy services, including coal terminal services (the Baltimore Terminal), water services and land resource management services.

The following map provides the location of CONSOL Energy's E&P and coal operations by region: 
CONSOL Energy defines itself through its core values which are:

• | Safety,


• | Compliance, and


• | Continuous Improvement.

These values are the foundation of CONSOL Energy's identity and are the basis for how management defines continued success. We believe CONSOL Energy's rich resource base, coupled with these core values, allows management to create value for the long-term. The electric power industry generates approximately two-thirds of its output by burning natural gas or coal, the two fuels we produce. We believe that the use of natural gas and coal will continue for many years as the principal fuel sources for electricity in the United States. Additionally, we believe that as worldwide economies grow, the demand for electricity from fossil fuels will grow as well, resulting in expansion of worldwide demand for our coal and potentially for our natural gas.
CONSOL Energy's Strategy
CONSOL Energy's strategy is to increase shareholder value through the development and growth of its existing natural gas assets, selective acquisition of natural gas and natural gas liquid acreage leases within its footprint, and through the participation in global coal markets. Ultimately, we intend to separate our E&P division and our PA Mining Operations division and to focus on the growth of our E&P division. We also will continue to focus on monetization of assets to accelerate value creation and to minimize the shortfall between operating cash flows and our growth capital requirements. 
We expect natural gas to become a more significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix, as well as fueling industrial growth in the U.S. economy. With the recent growth of natural gas exports to Mexico and Canada and the United States becoming a net exporter of natural gas in 2016, we expect new markets to open up in the coming years. We feel that our significant increases in natural gas production, our reductions in drilling and operating costs and our vast acreage position will allow CONSOL Energy to take advantage of these markets.

CONSOL Energy’s coal assets align with the PA Mining Operations division's long-term strategic objectives. The production, which include the Bailey, Enlow Fork, and Harvey mines, can be sold domestically or abroad, as either thermal coal or high volatile metallurgical coal. These low-cost mines, with five longwalls, produce a high-Btu Pittsburgh-seam coal that is lower in sulfur than many Northern Appalachian coals. 
These mines, along with our 100%-owned Baltimore Terminal, will continue to allow CONSOL Energy to participate in the world’s thermal and metallurgical coal markets. The ability to serve both domestic and international markets with premium thermal and metallurgical coal provides tremendous optionality.
CONSOL Energy's E&P Capital Expenditure Budget
In 2017, the E&P division expects capital expenditures of approximately $555 million. The E&P division capital expenditures are comprised of the following: $465 million for drilling and completion activity; $40 million for midstream, including capital contributions to CONE Midstream Partners, LP; and $50 million for other activities related to land, permitting, and business development. 
DETAIL E&P OPERATIONS 
Our E&P operations are located throughout Appalachia and include the following plays:
Marcellus Shale 
We have the rights to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 413,000 net Marcellus Shale acres at December 31, 2016. 
The Upper Devonian Shale formation, which includes both the Burkett Shale and Rhinestreet Shale, lies above the Marcellus Shale formation in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The company holds a large number of acres that have Upper Devonian potential; these acres have not been disclosed separately as they coincide with our Marcellus acreage.
In December 2016, CONSOL Energy terminated the 50-50 Joint Venture that was formed in 2011, with Noble Energy, Inc., for the exploration, development, and operation of primarily Marcellus Shale properties in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. As a result of the termination, each party now owns and operates a 100% interest in its properties and wells in two separate operating areas; and each party will now have independent control and flexibility with respect to the scope and timing of future development over its operating area.
We also hold a 50% interest in an entity that constructs and operates the gathering system for most of our Marcellus shale production. As of September 30, 2011, we contributed our existing Marcellus Shale gathering assets to this company. In September of 2014, the majority of these assets were contributed to CONE Midstream Partners LP. See "Midstream Gas Services" for a more detailed explanation. 
Utica Shale
We have the rights to extract natural gas in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio from approximately 683,000 net Utica Shale acres at December 31, 2016. Approximately 305,000 Utica acres coincide with Marcellus Shale acreage in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.
 Coalbed Methane (CBM)
We have the rights to extract CBM in Virginia from approximately 268,000 net CBM acres, which cover a portion of our coal reserves in Central Appalachia. We produce CBM natural gas primarily from the Pocahontas #3 seam.
We also have the rights to extract CBM in West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and Ohio from approximately 912,000 net CBM acres. In central Pennsylvania we have the right to extract CBM from approximately 260,000 net CBM acres. In addition, we control approximately 584,000 net CBM acres in Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee. We also have the right to extract CBM on approximately139,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. We have no plans to drill CBM wells in these areas in 2017.
8

Other Gas 
Shallow Oil and Gas 
We have the rights to extract natural gas from shallow oil and gas positions in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and New York from approximately 766,000 net acres at December 31, 2016. The majority of our shallow oil and gas leasehold position is held by production and all of it is extensively overlain by existing third-party gas gathering and transmission infrastructure. 
Chattanooga 
We have the rights to extract natural gas in Tennessee from approximately 95,000 net Chattanooga Shale acres at December 31, 2016.
Huron
We have approximately 503,000 net acres of Huron Shale potential in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia; a portion of this acreage has tight sands potential.

(1) | Net acres include acreage attributable to our working interests in the properties. Additional adjustments (either increases or decreases) may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development. We believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable. See Risk Factors in Section 1A of this Form 10-K.


(2) | Acreage amounts are only included under the target strata CONSOL Energy expects to produce with the exception of certain CBM acres governed by separate leases, although the reported acres may include rights to multiple gas seams (e.g. we have rights to Marcellus segment that are disclosed under the Utica segment and we have rights to Utica segment that are disclosed under the Marcellus segment). We have reviewed our drilling plans, our acreage rights and used our best judgment to reflect the acres in the strata we expect to primarily produce. As more information is obtained or circumstances change, the acreage classification may change.

Producing Wells and Acreage 
Most of our development wells and proved acreage are located in Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Some leases are beyond their primary term, but these leases are extended in accordance with their terms as long as certain drilling commitments or other term commitments are satisfied.

(1) | Net acres include acreage attributable to our working interests in the properties. Additional adjustments (either increases or decreases) may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development. We believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable. See Risk Factors in Section 1A of this Form 10-K.

The following table represents the terms under which we hold these acres:    

 | Net Unproved Acres | Net Proved Undeveloped Acres
Held by production/fee | 3,644,799 | | 13,967
Expiration within 2 years | 68,084 | | 9,347 
Expiration beyond 2 years | 32,650 | | 6,724 
Total Acreage | 3,745,533 | | 30,038

The leases reflected above as Net Unproved Acres with expiration dates are included in our current drill plan or active land program. Leases with expiration dates within two years represent approximately 2% of our total acres in the above categories and leases with expiration dates beyond two years represent approximately 1% of our total acres in the above categories. In each case, we deemed this acreage to not be material to our overall acreage position. Additionally, based on our current drill plans and lease management we do not anticipate any material impact to our consolidated financial statements from the expiration of such leases.
Development Wells (Net) 
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we drilled 36.0, 132.8 and 180.3 net development wells, respectively. Gob wells and wells drilled by operators other than our primary joint venture partners at that time, Noble Energy and Hess Corporation, are excluded from net development wells. In 2016, there were 68 gross development wells drilled but uncompleted. There were no dry development wells in 2016, 2015, or 2014. As of December 31, 2016, there are 3.0 gross completed developmental wells ready to be turned in-line. The following table illustrates the net wells drilled by well classification type:

Total standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows | $ | 955 | | $ | 1,019 | $ | 2,984

____________

(1) | We calculate our present value at 10% (PV-10) in accordance with the following table. Management believes that the presentation of the non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes estimated to be paid, the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable when comparing companies based on reserves. PV-10 is not a measure of the financial or operating performance under GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the

11

standardized measure as defined under GAAP. We have included a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure-after-tax discounted future net cash flows.

*Oil, NGLs, and Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas.
CONSOL Energy expects 2017 annual gas production to grow to approximately 415 Bcfe and increase to approximately 485 Bcfe in 2018. 
Average Sales Price and Average Lifting Cost 
The following table sets forth the total average sales price and the total average lifting cost for all of our natural gas and liquids production for the periods indicated, including intersegment transactions. Total lifting cost is the cost of raising gas to the gathering system and does not include depreciation, depletion or amortization. See Part II Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K for a breakdown by segment.

*Oil, NGLs, and Condensate are converted to Mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas.
Sales of NGLs, condensates, and oil enhance our reported natural gas equivalent sales price. Across all volumes, when excluding the impact of hedging, sales of liquids added $0.09 per Mcfe, $0.05 per Mcfe, and $0.25 per Mcfe for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, to average gas sales prices. CONSOL Energy expects to continue to realize a liquids uplift benefit as additional wells are brought online in the liquid-rich areas of the Marcellus and Utica shales. We continue to sell the majority of our NGLs through the large midstream companies that process our natural gas. This approach allows us to take advantage of the processors’ transportation efficiencies and diversified markets. CONSOL Energy’s processing contracts provide for the ability to take our NGLs “in kind” and market them directly if desired. The processed purity products are ultimately sold to industrial, commercial, and petrochemical markets. 
We enter into physical natural gas sales transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length. Reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations. In the past, we have delivered quantities required under these contracts. We also enter into various natural gas swap transactions. These gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately 264.9 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 at an average price of $3.04 per Mcf. The notional volumes associated with these gas swaps represented approximately 173.1 Bcf of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2015 at an average price of $3.68 per Mcf. As of January 17, 2017, we expect these transactions will represent approximately 311.3 Bcf of our estimated 2017 production at an average price of $2.61 per Mcf, 220.6 Bcf of our estimated 2018 production at an average price of $2.75 per Mcf, 161.7 Bcf of our estimated 2019 production at an average price of $2.76 per Mcf, approximately 85 Bcf of our estimated 2020 production at an average price of $2.91 per Mcf, and approximately 6.8 Bcf of our estimated 2021 production at an average price of $3.08 per Mcf.

The hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk and in Note 21 - Derivative Instruments in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Midstream Gas Services 
CONSOL Energy has traditionally designed, built and operated natural gas gathering systems to move gas from the wellhead to interstate pipelines or other local sales points. In addition, CONSOL Energy has acquired extensive gathering assets. CONSOL Energy now owns or operates approximately 5,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines as well as 250,000 horsepower of compression, of which, approximately 75% is wholly owned with the balance being leased. Along with this compression capacity, CONSOL Energy owns and operates a number of natural gas processing facilities. This infrastructure is capable of delivering approximately 750 billion cubic feet per year of pipeline quality gas.
CONSOL Energy owns 50% of CONE Gathering LLC ("CONE" or "CONE Gathering") along with Noble Energy owning the other 50% interest. CONE Gathering develops, operates and owns substantially all of Noble Energy's and CONSOL Energy's Marcellus Shale gathering systems. CONSOL Energy operates this equity affiliate. We believe that the network of right-of-ways, vast surface holdings and experience in building and operating gathering systems in the Appalachian basin will give CONE Gathering an advantage in building the midstream assets required to develop our Marcellus Shale position. On September 30, 2014, CONE Midstream Partners LP (the Partnership) closed its initial public offering. See Note 25 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.

In the Utica Shale, we and our joint venture partner, Hess, primarily contract with third-parties for gathering services. 
CONSOL Energy has developed a diversified portfolio of firm transportation capacity options to support its production growth plan. CONSOL Energy plans to selectively acquire as needed firm capacity while minimizing transportation costs and long-term financial obligations and, in the near term if appropriate, plans to optimize and/or release firm transportation to others. CONSOL Energy also benefits from the strategic location of our primary production areas in Southwest Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia, and Eastern Ohio. These areas are currently served by a large concentration of major pipelines that provide us with the capacity to move our production to the major gas markets, and it is expected that recently-approved pipeline projects will increase the take-away capacity from our region. In addition to firm transportation capacity, CONSOL Energy has developed a processing portfolio to support the projected volumes from its wet production areas and has operational and contractual flexibility to potentially convert a portion of currently processed wet gas volumes to be marketed as dry gas volumes.
CONSOL Energy has the advantage of having gas production from CBM, which can be lower Btu than pipeline specification, as well as higher Btu Marcellus and Utica shale production. These types of gas can be complementary by reducing and in some cases eliminating the need for the costly processing of CBM. In addition, our lower Btu CBM and dry Marcellus and Utica production offer an opportunity to blend ethane back into the gas stream when pricing or capacity in ethane markets dictate. In developing a diversified approach to managing ethane, CONSOL Energy has entered into ethane supply agreements and is also discussing future outlet opportunities with ethane customers and midstream companies. These different gas types allow us more flexibility in bringing Marcellus and Utica shale wells on-line at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications.
Natural Gas Competition
The United States natural gas industry is highly competitive. CONSOL Energy competes with other large producers, as well as a myriad of smaller producers and marketers. CONSOL Energy also competes for pipeline and other services to deliver its products to customers. According to data from the Natural Gas Supply Association and the Energy Information Agency (EIA), the five largest U.S. producers of natural gas produced about 16% of dry natural gas production during the first nine months of 2016. The EIA reported 554,201 producing natural gas wells in the United States at December 31, 2015 (the latest year for which government statistics are available), which is approximately two percent lower than 2014.
CONSOL Energy expects natural gas to be a significant contributor to the domestic electric generation mix in the long-term, as well as to fuel industrial growth in the U.S. economy. According to the EIA, based on preliminary results, natural gas represented 34% of U.S. electricity generation during 2016 compared with 33% in 2015. With the recent growth of natural gas exports to Mexico and Canada and increased liquefied natural gas exports, the U.S. became a net exporter of gas in 2016. CONSOL expects the high level of U.S. gas exports to continue in the future. In addition, there is potential for natural gas to become a significant contributor to the transportation market. Our increasing gas production will allow CONSOL Energy to participate in these growing markets.
CONSOL Energy's gas operations are primarily located in the eastern United States. The gas market is highly fragmented and not dominated by any single producer. We believe that competition within our market is based primarily on natural gas commodity trading fundamentals and pipeline transportation availability to the various markets.
Continued demand for CONSOL Energy's natural gas and the prices that CONSOL Energy obtains are affected by natural gas use in the production of electricity, pipeline capacity, U.S. manufacturing and the overall strength of the economy, environmental and government regulation, technological developments, the availability and price of competing alternative fuel supplies, and national and regional supply/demand dynamics.

DETAIL COAL OPERATIONS 
Coal Reserves 
At December 31, 2016, CONSOL Energy had an estimated 2.4 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Reserves are the portion of the proven and probable tonnage that meet CONSOL Energy's economic criteria regarding mining height, preparation plant recovery, depth of overburden and stripping ratio. Generally, these reserves would be commercially mineable at year-end price and cost levels. 
Spacing of points of observation for confidence levels in reserve calculations is based on guidelines in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 891 (Coal Resource Classification System of the U.S. Geological Survey). Our estimates for proved reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance. Estimates for proved reserves are based on points of observation that are equal to or less than 0.5 miles apart. Estimates for probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are computed from points of observation that are between 0.5 to 1.5 miles apart. 
An exception is made concerning spacing of observation points with respect to our Pittsburgh coal seam reserves. Because of the well-known continuity of this seam, spacing requirements are 3,000 feet or less for proved reserves and between 3,000 and 8,000 feet for probable reserves. 
CONSOL Energy's estimates of proven and probable coal reserves do not rely on isolated points of observation. Small pods of reserves based on a single observation point are not considered; continuity between observation points over a large area is necessary for proved or probable reserves. 
CONSOL Energy's proven and probable coal reserves fall within the range of commercially marketed coals in the United States. The marketability of coal depends on its value-in-use for a particular application, and this is affected by coal quality, such as sulfur content, ash and heating value. Modern power plant boiler design aspects can compensate for coal quality differences that occur. Therefore, any of CONSOL Energy's coals can be marketed for the electric power generation industry. Additionally, the growth in worldwide demand for metallurgical coal allows some of our proven and probable coal reserves, currently classified as thermal coals, that possess certain qualities to be sold as metallurgical coal. The addition of this cross-over market adds additional assurance to CONSOL Energy that all of its proven and probable coal reserves are commercially marketable.  
CONSOL Energy assigns coal reserves to our mining complex. The amount of coal we assign to the mining complex generally is sufficient to support mining through the duration of our current mining permit. Under federal law, we must renew our mining permits every five years. All assigned reserves have their required permits or governmental approvals, or there is a high probability that these approvals will be secured. 
In addition, our mining complex may have access to additional reserves that have not yet been assigned. We refer to these reserves as accessible. Accessible reserves are proven and probable coal reserves that can be accessed by an existing mining complex, utilizing the existing infrastructure of the complex to mine and to process the coal in this area. Mining an accessible reserve does not require additional capital spending beyond that required to extend or to continue the normal progression of the mine, such as the sinking of airshafts or the construction of portal facilities. 
Some reserves may be accessible by more than one mine because of the proximity of many of our mines to one another. In the table below, the accessible reserves indicated for a mine are based on our review of current mining plans and reflect our best judgment as to which mine is most likely to utilize the reserve. 
Assigned and unassigned coal reserves are proven and probable coal reserves which are either owned or leased. The leases have terms extending up to 30 years and generally provide for renewal through the anticipated life of the associated mine. These renewals are exercisable by the payment of minimum royalties. Under current mining plans, assigned reserves reported will be mined out within the period of existing leases or within the time period of probable lease renewal periods.

_____________

(1) | The heat values shown for Assigned Operating reserves are based on the 2016 actual quality and five-year forecasted quality for each mine/reserve, assuming that the coal is washed to an extent consistent with normal full-capacity operation of the complex's preparation plant. Actual quality is based on laboratory analysis of samples collected from coal shipments delivered in 2016. Forecasted quality is derived from exploration sample analysis results, which have been adjusted to account for anticipated moisture and for the effects of mining and coal preparation. The heat values shown for Accessible Reserves are based on as received, dry values obtained from drill hole analyses, adjusted for moisture, and prorated by the associated Assigned Operating product values to account for similar mining and processing methods.


(2) | Recoverable reserves are calculated based on the area in which mineable coal exists, coal seam thickness, and average density determined by laboratory testing of drill core samples. This calculation is adjusted to account for coal that will not be recovered during mining and for losses that occur if the coal is processed after mining. Reserves tons are reported on an as-received basis, based on the anticipated product moisture. Reserves are reported only for those coal seams that are controlled by ownership or leases.

The following table sets forth our unassigned proven and probable coal reserves by region:

(1) | The heat value (gross calorific values) estimates for Northern Appalachian and Central Appalachian Unassigned coal reserves include adjustments for moisture that may be added during mining or processing as well as for dilution by rock lying above or below the coal seam. The heat value estimates for the Illinois Basin Unassigned reserves are based primarily on exploration drill core data that may not include adjustments for moisture added during mining or processing, or for dilution by rock lying above or below the coal seam.


(2) | Recoverable reserves are calculated based on the area in which mineable coal exists, coal seam thickness, and average density determined by laboratory testing of drill core samples. This calculation is adjusted to account for coal that will not be recovered during mining and for losses that occur if the coal is processed after mining. Reserve calculations do not include adjustment for moisture that may be added during mining or processing, nor do the calculations include adjustments for dilution from rock lying above or below the coal seam. Reserves are reported only for those coal seams that are controlled by ownership or leases.


(3) | 140.8 Million tons of the Northern Appalachia leased tons are controlled by Consolidation Coal Company, a former subsidiary of CONSOL Energy that was sold in December 2013. As of filing these tons are still controlled by Consolidation Coal Company but are shown in CONSOL Energy's reserves due to a binding agreement that these tons will be released to CONSOL Energy following the change in name of the Lease Holder.

(1) | 143.3 Million tons for the Mason Dixon Project are controlled by Consolidation Coal Company, a former subsidiary of CONSOL Energy that was sold in December 2013. As of this filing, these tons are still controlled by Consolidation Coal Company but are shown in CONSOL Energy's reserves due to a binding agreement that these tons will be released to CONSOL Energy upon consent of the lessor.

Title to coal properties that we lease or purchase and the boundaries of these properties are verified by law firms retained by us at the time we lease or acquire the properties. Consistent with industry practice, abstracts and title reports are reviewed and updated approximately five years prior to planned development or mining of the property. If defects in title or boundaries of undeveloped reserves are discovered in the future, control of and the right to mine reserves could be adversely affected.
The following table sets forth, with respect to properties that we lease to other coal operators, the total royalty tonnage, acreage leased and the amount of income (net of related expenses) we received from royalty payments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 

 | Total | Total | Total

Production 
In the year ended December 31, 2016, 100% of CONSOL Energy's production came from underground mines equipped with longwall mining systems. CONSOL Energy employs longwall mining systems in our underground mines where the geology is favorable and reserves are sufficient. Underground longwall systems are highly mechanized, capital intensive operations. Mines using longwall systems have a low variable cost structure compared with other types of mines and can achieve high productivity levels compared with those of other underground mining methods. Because CONSOL Energy has substantial reserves readily suitable to these operations, CONSOL Energy believes that these longwall mines can increase capacity at a low incremental cost. 
The following table shows the production from continuing operations, in millions of tons, for CONSOL Energy's mines for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the location of each mine, the type of mine, the type of equipment used at each mine, method of transportation and the year each mine was established or acquired by us.

We sell coal produced by our mines and additional coal that is purchased by us for resale from other producers. We maintain United States sales offices in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In addition, we sell coal through agents and to brokers and unaffiliated trading companies. 
Approximately 75% of our 2016 coal sales were made to U. S. electric generators, 22% of our 2016 coal sales were priced on export markets and 3% of our coal sales were made to other domestic customers. We had sales to over 35 customers from our 2016 coal operations. During 2016, two customers each comprised over 10% of our coal sales, and the top four coal customers accounted for over 40% of our coal sales.
Coal Contracts 
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships, or through a formalized bidding process. Contract volumes range from a single shipment to multi-year agreements for millions of tons of coal. The average contract term is between one to three years. As a normal course of business, efforts are made to renew or extend contracts scheduled to expire. Although there are no guarantees, we generally have been successful in renewing or extending contracts in the past. For the year ended December 31, 2016, over 65% of all the coal we produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more. 

CONSOL Energy expects total consolidated PA Mining Operations annual sales to be approximately 26.0 million tons for both 2017 and 2018.
Coal pricing for contracts with terms of one year or less are generally fixed. Coal pricing for multiple-year agreements generally provide the opportunity to periodically adjust the contract prices through pricing mechanisms consisting of one or more of the following: 

• | Fixed price contracts with pre-established prices;


• | Periodically negotiated prices that reflect market conditions at the time;


• | Price restricted to an agreed-upon percentage increase or decrease;


• | Base-price-plus-escalation methods which allow for periodic price adjustments based on inflation indices, or other negotiated indices; or


• | Netback pricing.

The volume of coal to be delivered is specified in each of our coal contracts. Although the volume to be delivered under the coal contracts is stipulated, the parties may vary the timing of the deliveries within specified limits. 
Coal contracts typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of specified events. Force majeure events include, but are not limited to, unexpected significant geological conditions or natural disasters. Depending on the language of the contract, some contracts may terminate upon continuance of an event of force majeure that extends for a period greater than three to twelve months. 
Distribution 
Coal is transported from CONSOL Energy's mining operations to customers by railroad cars, trucks or a combination of these means of transportation. Most customers negotiate their own transportation rates and we employ transportation specialists who negotiate freight and equipment agreements with various transportation suppliers, including railroads, barge lines, terminal operators, ocean vessel brokers and trucking companies for certain customers. 
Coal Competition
Both the domestic and international coal industries are highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. CONSOL Energy competes against several other large producers and numerous small producers in the United States and overseas. Demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by many factors including:

• | the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies, including nuclear, natural gas, oil and

renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, wind or solar;

• | environmental and government regulation;


• | coal quality;


• | transportation costs from the mine to the customer;

20


• | the reliability of fuel supply;


• | worldwide demand for steel;


• | natural disasters/weather; and


• | political changes in international governments.

Continued demand for CONSOL Energy's coal and the prices that CONSOL Energy obtains are affected by demand for electricity, technological developments, environmental and governmental regulation, and the availability and price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies. We sell coal to foreign electricity generators which are significantly affected by international demand and competition.
Other Operations
CONSOL Energy provides other services both to our own operations and to others. These include land services, coal terminal services and water services. 
Non-Core Mineral Assets and Surface Properties
CONSOL Energy owns significant gas and coal assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans. We continually explore the monetization of these non-core assets by means of sale, lease, contribution to joint ventures, or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our shareholders. We also control a significant amount of surface acreage. This surface acreage is valuable to us in the development of the gathering system for our Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale production. We also derive value from this surface control by granting rights of way or development rights to third-parties when we are able to derive appropriate value for our shareholders.
Terminal Services 
In 2016, approximately 8.1 million tons of coal were shipped through CONSOL Energy's subsidiary, CNX Marine Terminals Inc.'s, exporting terminal in the Port of Baltimore. Approximately 63% of the tonnage shipped was produced by CONSOL Energy's PA Mining Operations. The terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars. It is also one of the few terminals in the United States served by two railroads, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation Inc.
Water Division
CNX Water Assets LLC, doing business as CONVEY Water Systems LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CONSOL Energy and supplies turnkey solutions for water sourcing, delivery and disposal for our E&P operations, supplies solutions for water sourcing, delivery and disposal for third-parties and also provides supplemental water sourcing and marketing efforts on behalf of CNXC. In coordination with our midstream operations, CONVEY Water Systems works to develop solutions that coincide with our midstream operations to offer gas gathering and water delivery solutions in one package to third-parties. 
Employee and Labor Relations 
At December 31, 2016, CONSOL Energy had 2,307 employees. There were no employees represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) at December 31, 2016.
Industry Segments 
Financial information concerning industry segments, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is included in Note 23 - Segment Information in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and incorporated herein.

Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our natural gas and coal mining operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Regulations relating to our operations include permitting and other licensing requirements; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well drilling and casing; well production; well plugging; venting or flaring of natural gas; pipeline compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids; reclamation and restoration of properties after natural gas or coal mining operations are completed; storage, transportation and disposal of materials used or generated by gas and mining operations; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of taxes; gathering of gas production in certain circumstances; surface subsidence from underground mining; discharge of water from coal mining operations; air quality standards; protection of wetlands; endangered plant and wildlife protection; and employee health and safety. Numerous governmental permits and approvals under these laws and regulations are required for gas and mining operations. Lastly, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our natural gas and coal products. 
Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of natural gas production and mining of coal for all domestic natural gas and coal producers. We also post performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to state oil and gas laws and regulations to guarantee reclamation of gas well sites and plugging of gas wells. We post surety performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, often including the cost of treating mine water discharge. We endeavor to conduct our natural gas and mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions, permit exceedances and violations during natural gas and mining operations can and do occur. The possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our natural gas and coal mining operations or our customers' ability to use our gas and coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs.
CONSOL Energy is committed to complying with all laws and regulations. This commitment is evident in CONSOL Energy's demonstrated cost and effort to abate and control pollution and/or contamination at its facilities. CONSOL Energy made capital expenditures for environmental control facilities of approximately $0.6 million, $18.4 million, and $19.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. CONSOL Energy does not expect to have any capital expenditures in 2017 for environmental control facilities.
Environmental Laws
Clean Air Act and Related Regulations. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and corresponding state laws and regulations regulate air emissions primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements. This affects natural gas production and processing operations as well as coal mining, coal handling, and processing.
We are required to obtain pre-approval for construction or modification of certain facilities, to meet stringent air permit requirements, or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions. On August 16, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published final revisions to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from various oil and gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. Additionally, revisions were made to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to further regulate emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector and the transmission and storage of natural gas. Section 111 of the CAA authorized the EPA to develop technology based standards which apply to specific categories of stationary sources. On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized updates to the final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) that created new standards for the regulation of methane and VOC emission sources. The rule includes requirements for new fugitive emission and leak detection testing and reporting requirements. Also on June 3, 2016, the EPA published the final Source Determination Rule which clarified the use of the term “adjacent” in determining Title V air permitting requirements as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry for major sources of air emissions. On August 1, 2016 these updates to the NSPS were challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by industry and state associations and a request for administrative reconsideration was also filed. Additionally, 15 states filed suit and asked the Court of Appeals to review the need for the changes. 
On November 30, 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). This final rule adds new monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment in the petroleum and natural gas systems source category consistent with the leak detection methods in the NSPS. The action also adds emission factors for leaking equipment to be used in conjunction with these monitoring methods to calculate and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from equipment leaks. The NSPS final rule would add reporting 
22

of GHG emissions from certain gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. 
The CAA also indirectly and more significantly affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers. Coal contains impurities, such as sulfur, mercury and other constituents, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a regulated GHG, is also emitted when coal is burned. Environmental regulations governing emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants increase the costs to operate and could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned, including plants to which CONSOL Energy sells coal to, and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future.
In early 2012, the EPA promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for coal- and oil- fired power plants which also have a negative effect on coal-generating facilities. The Utility Maximum Control Technology (UMACT) rule requires more stringent NSPS for particulate matter (PM), SO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOX) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule requires new mercury and air toxic standards. In November 2012, the EPA published a notice of reconsideration of certain aspects of the UMACT and MATS rules. Following reconsideration in April 2013 and again in April 2014, the EPA promulgated final UMACT and MATS rules in November 2014 at which point the standards become applicable to new power plants. The final rules have higher emission limits, but the standards are still stringent and compliance with the rules is expensive.
The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for certain pollutants and the CAA identifies two types of NAAQS. Primary standards provide public health protection, including protecting the health of "sensitive" populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. On October 1, 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule could have a large impact on both the oil and gas and coal mining industries as states would be required to update their permitting standards to meet these potentially unachievable limits. Six states have now filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized a rule known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, as well as byproducts, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone by requiring states to limit emissions from sources that "contribute significantly" to noncompliance with air quality standards for the criteria air pollutants. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in "nonattainment" for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. In April 2014, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that vacated the rule. Following remand and briefing the D.C. Circuit Court of appeals, in October 2014, granted a motion to lift a stay of the rule and allow the EPA to modify the CSAPR compliance deadline by three-years, setting the stage for issuance of the proposed rule. Implementation of CSAPR Phase 1 began in 2015, with Phase 2 scheduled to begin in 2017. On September 7, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR for the 2008 ozone NAAQS by issuing the final CSAPR Update. Starting in May 2017, this rule will reduce summertime (May - September) NOX emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States. 
On March 27, 2012, the EPA published its proposed NSPS for CO2 emissions from new coal-powered electric generating units. The proposed rule would have applied to new power plants and to existing plants that make major modifications. If the rule had been adopted as proposed, only new coal-fired power plants with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) could have met the proposed emission limits. Commercial scale CCS is not likely to be available in the near future, and if available, it may make coal-fired electric generation units uneconomical compared to new gas-fired electric generation units. On January 8, 2014, the EPA re-proposed NSPS for CO2 for new fossil fuel fired power plants and rescinded the rules that were proposed on April 12, 2012.
On September 20, 2013, the EPA issued a new proposal to control carbon emissions from new power plants. Under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) proposal, the EPA would establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. The proposed “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants” replaces the earlier proposal released by the EPA in 2012. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Carbon Pollution Standards to cut carbon emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants, which would have become effective on October 23, 2015. 
On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed additional CPP legislation to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. Under this proposed rule, the EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA is proposing state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the state-specific goals.

On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the CPP Rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which would have become effective on December 22, 2015. Numerous petitions challenging the CPP Rule have been consolidated into one case, West Virginia v. EPA. While the litigation is still ongoing at the circuit court level, a mid-litigation application to the Supreme Court resulted in a stay of the Clean Power Plan Rule. On September 27, 2016, the en banc D.C. Circuit heard oral argument in the case and a decision is expected in early 2017.
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and corresponding state laws affect our natural gas and coal operations by regulating discharges into surface waters. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The CWA and corresponding state laws include requirements for: improvement of designated "impaired waters" (i.e., not meeting state water quality standards) through the use of effluent limitations; anti-degradation regulations which protect state designated "high quality/exceptional use" streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges; requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, selenium and dissolved solids; requirements to minimize impacts and compensate for unavoidable impacts resulting from discharges of fill materials to regulated streams and wetlands; and requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. In addition, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) requirements of the CWA apply to all CONSOL Energy operations that use or produce fluids and require the implementation of plans to address any spills and the installation of secondary containment around all storage tanks. These requirements may cause CONSOL Energy to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
Pursuant to a Congressional requirement in the EPA's 2010 budget appropriation, the EPA must conduct a comprehensive study of the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. Hydraulic fracturing is a way of producing natural gas from tight rock formations such as the Marcellus shale and Utica shale. The EPA initiated the study in early January 2011 and the final assessment report was published on June 4, 2015. The draft report stated that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts to drinking water resources. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released its final report on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. While the language was changed and included the possibility of impacts from hydraulic fracturing, it also included the guidance to industry and regulators on how the process can be done safely.
CONSOL Energy utilizes pipelines extensively for its natural gas, water and coal businesses. Mitigation permits from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) are typically required for certain impacts these pipelines cause to streams and wetlands. On April 21, 2014 the EPA published a proposed rule called “Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’ (WoUS) Under the Clean Water Act.” The proposal would expand the scope of the CWA to include previously non-jurisdictional streams, wetlands, and waters, making these areas jurisdictional inter-coastal waters of the U.S. In February 2015 the EPA and ACOE issued a memorandum of understanding to withdraw the WoUS Interpretive Rule. The EPA published the latest version of the WoUS rule (the Clean Water Rule) on June 29, 2015, which was to become effective on August 28, 2015. However, on August 27, 2015, the District Court of North Dakota blocked implementation of the rule in 13 states. On October 9, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit blocked implementation of the rule nationwide. The U.S. Supreme Court will now decide which court has jurisdiction - federal appeals court or district courts. A decision is expected sometime in mid 2017. 
Safety of Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines. On April 8, 2016, The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) that would significantly modify existing regulations related to reporting, impact, design, construction, maintenance, operations and integrity management of gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rule addresses four congressional mandates and six recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board. The proposed rule broadens the scope of safety coverage both by adding new assessment and repair criteria for gas transmission pipelines, and by expanding these protocols to include pipelines not formerly regulated by the federal standards. This means extending regulatory requirements to transmission and gathering pipelines of 8 inches and greater in rural class 1 areas, which could increase timeframes and cost to complete projects.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect natural gas operations and coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows. On December 28, 2016 the EPA entered into a consent order to resolve outstanding litigation brought by environmental and citizen groups regarding the applicability of RCRA to wastes from oil and gas development activities. The consent order requires the EPA to revise the applicability determination by March 15, 2019.
24

In 2010, the EPA proposed options for the regulation of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) from the electric power sector as either hazardous waste or non-hazardous waste. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the first national regulations for the disposal of CCRs from electric utilities and independent power producers under RCRA. On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized these regulations under the solid waste provisions (Subtitle D) of RCRA and not the hazardous waste provisions (Subtitle C) which became effective on October 19, 2015. The EPA affirms in the preamble to the final rule that “this rule does not apply to CCR placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines.” Instead, “the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) and the EPA will address the management of CCR in mine fills in a separate regulatory action(s).” On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (ELG), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCR and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that can’t comply with the new standards.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) establishes minimum national operational and reclamation standards for all surface mines, as well as most aspects of underground mines. SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the U.S. Office of Surface Mining (OSM) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. States that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA and OSM's regulations and in many instances have done so. Our active mining complexes are located in Pennsylvania which has primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through its approved state program. In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (AML Fund), which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.28 per ton for surface mined coal and $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. These fees are currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021.
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety-bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral. Any failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.
Excess Spoil, Coal Mine Waste, Diversions, and Buffer Zones for Perennial and Intermittent Streams. The OSM has issued final amendments to regulations concerning stream buffer zones, stream channel diversions, excess spoil, and coal mine waste to comply with an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 20, 2014, which vacated the stream buffer zone rule that was published December 12, 2008. On July 27, 2015, the OSM published the proposed Stream Protection Rule (SPR). After much debate and thousands of comments, the final SPR was published by the OSM in the Federal Register on December 20, 2016. The final SPR requires the restoration of the physical form, hydrologic function, and ecological function of the segment of a perennial or intermittent stream that a permittee mines through. Additionally, it requires that the post-mining surface configuration of the reclaimed mine site include a drainage pattern, including ephemeral streams, similar to the pre-mining drainage pattern, with exceptions for stability, topographical changes, fish and wildlife habitat, etc. The rule also requires the establishment of a 100-foot-wide streamside vegetative corridor of native species (including riparian species, when appropriate) along each bank of any restored or permanently-diverted perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral stream. This rulemaking is highly anticipated to be subject to Legislative and Executive branch actions to overturn or significantly modify the rule.
Federal Regulation of the Sale and Transportation of Natural Gas
 Regulations and orders set forth by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) impact our natural gas business to a certain degree. Although the FERC does not directly regulate our natural gas production activities, the FERC has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. Additionally, the FERC continues to review its transportation regulations, including whether to allocate all short-term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions and whether changes to its long-term transportation policies may also be appropriate to avoid a market bias toward short-term contracts. The FERC has also issued numerous orders confirming the sale and abandonment of natural gas gathering facilities previously owned by interstate pipelines and acknowledging that if the FERC does not have jurisdiction over services provided by these facilities, then such facilities and services may be subject to regulation by state authorities in accordance with state law. We own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to the FERC jurisdiction.

Health and Safety Laws
Occupational Safety and Health Act. Our gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state laws in some states, all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our natural gas operations. Also, OSHA's hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our natural gas operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and the public.
Mine Safety. Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols and with new regulations the amount of civil penalties has increased. The actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring:

• | the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of proximity detection services on continuous miner machines;


• | the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours;


• | the replacement of existing seals in worked-out areas of mines with stronger seals;


• | the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground;


• | additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees;


• | more stringent rock dusting requirements; and


• | the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners.

On October 2, 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. On January 15, 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring underground coal mine operations to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in accidents involving life-threatening injuries and death. The final rule became effective March 15, 2015 and included a phased in schedule for newly manufactured and in-service equipment. In 2010 MSHA rolled out the “End Black Lung, Act Now” initiative. As a result, MSHA implemented a new final rule on August 1, 2014 to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust including using the new Personal Dust Monitor (PDM) technology. This final rule was implemented in three phases. The first phase began August 1, 2014 and utilizes the current gravimetric sampling device to take full shift dust samples from the current designated occupations and areas. It also requires additional record keeping and immediate corrective action in the event of overexposure. The second phase began February 1, 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor (CPDM) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CONSOL Energy ordered the necessary CPDM equipment required to meet compliance with the new rule at a cost of $2 million. We also hired Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The final phase of the rule was effective on August 1, 2016. when the current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 Miners.

Black Lung Legislation.  Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to:

• | current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease;


• | certain survivors of a coal miner who dies from black lung disease or pneumoconiosis; and


• | a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a coal miner's last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner's work. Second, it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner's death. The changes have increased the 
26

cost to CONSOL Energy of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for black lung claims.
Other State and Local Laws Related to Our Natural Gas Business
Regulation Affecting Gas Operations. Our natural gas operations are also subject to regulation at the state and in some cases, county, municipal and local governmental levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the siting and construction of well pads and roads, drilling of wells, bonding requirements, protection of ground water and surface water resources and protection of drinking water supplies, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of well sites, gas flaring, the plugging and abandoning of wells, the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations and natural gas operations producing coalbed methane in relation to active mining. A number of states have either enacted new laws or may be considering the adequacy of existing laws affecting gathering rates and/or services. Other state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements but does not generally entail rate regulation. Thus, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny of state agencies in the future. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to increased state regulation of rates or services, although we do not believe that they would be affected by such regulation any differently than other natural gas producers or gatherers. However, these regulatory burdens may affect profitability, and we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations.
 Ownership of Mineral Rights. CONSOL Energy acquires ownership or leasehold rights to oil and gas properties and coal properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the natural gas and coal industries, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to oil and gas rights and coal rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of mineral rights. Given CONSOL Energy's long history as a coal producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our coal control; however, our ownership of oil and gas rights, particularly those rights that we acquired in connection with our historic coal operations and some of the rights we acquired in 2010, as part of an acquisition, are less developed. As we continue to review our land records and confirm title in anticipation of development, we expect that adjustments to our ownership position (either increases or decreases) will be required.
Prior to the commencement of development operations on natural gas and coal properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. In addition, the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some cases. Our discovering natural gas title defects which we are unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and we may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves. We have completed title work on substantially all of our natural gas and coal producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.
