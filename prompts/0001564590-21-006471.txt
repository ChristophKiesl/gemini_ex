Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a leading global biopharmaceutical solutions organization providing a full suite of clinical and commercial services to customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. We offer both stand-alone and integrated biopharmaceutical product development solutions ranging from Early Phase (Phase I) clinical trials to the full commercialization of biopharmaceutical products, with the goal of increasing the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success.
 Our operations are divided into two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Our Clinical Solutions segment offers a variety of services spanning Phases I to IV of clinical development, including full service global studies, as well as individual service offerings such as clinical monitoring, investigator recruitment, patient recruitment, data management, and study startup to assist customers with their drug development process. Our Commercial Solutions segment provides commercialization services, including deployment solutions, communication solutions (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services. We integrate our clinical and commercial capabilities into customized solutions by sharing knowledge, data, and insights through our biopharmaceutical acceleration model (“BAM”). This collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights into patient populations, therapeutic environments, product timelines, and the competitive landscape.
 Founded more than three decades ago as an academic organization dedicated to central nervous system ("CNS") research, we have translated that expertise into a global organization with deep therapeutic specialties, as well as full data services and regulatory advisory and implementation support capabilities. Over the past decade, we have built our scale and capabilities to become a leading global provider of Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services, as well as a full range of commercialization and other complementary services. We were established as INC Research in 1998, and our corporate headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. INC Research Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in August 2010. We changed our name to Syneos Health, Inc. after our 2017 merger (the “Merger”) with Double Eagle Parent, Inc. (“inVentiv”), the parent company of inVentiv Health, Inc.
COVID-19 Pandemic
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus that causes the disease known as COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Governments and businesses around the world have taken unprecedented actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, social distancing practices as well as restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work.
 The COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have impacted the locations where we, our customers, suppliers, and partners conduct significant portions of our business, such as Europe and North America, and, as a result, we experienced pronounced disruptions in our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020, the largest of which occurred during the second and third quarters of 2020.
 As a result of these conditions, we took decisive actions to mitigate the revenue, profitability, and cash flow impacts from COVID-19. These actions included cost management strategies consisting of certain temporary compensation adjustments, hiring restrictions, staffing reductions, voluntary and involuntary employee furloughs, reductions in third-party costs, and other initiatives. The majority of the temporary cost savings measures ended in the third quarter of 2020. In addition to these temporary actions, we continued to implement our ForwardBound margin enhancement initiative, which is our enterprise-wide effort designed to increase productivity and manage costs.

We are guided by our global and regional crisis team, which monitors the evolving situation and recommends risk mitigation actions related to business continuity and employee health and safety. Throughout the pandemic, we have assessed and implemented continuity plans to provide customers with continued services. We also continue to implement contingency planning to protect the health and well-being of our employees. This includes having employees work remotely where possible, implementing travel restrictions and visitor protocols, and following social distancing practices.
While the potential for further disruption to our business from the pandemic is difficult to predict and depends on factors not in our control, such as the degree of success of vaccinations and other treatments for COVID-19, we began to see a recovery in the latter half of 2020 in both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments and expect this recovery to continue in 2021. As of December 31, 2020, a substantial number of our clinical trial sites have returned to allowing physical monitoring visits, and in 2021, we expect a continued increase in patient enrollment rates and a moderate increase in the use of remote monitoring from pre-COVID-19 levels, although below levels necessitated in 2020. Further, in our Commercial Solutions segment, we expect to continue to see an increase in site access as well as the use of remote field team visits.
 While certain governments eased restrictions during the balance of 2020, the pandemic remains disruptive to our business operations. As we look ahead, we continue to expect impacts in our Clinical Solutions segment to be temporary and primarily relate to limitations on our ability to physically access investigative sites, delays in patient enrollment and trial start-up activities, as well as delayed decision making related to new business awards. Our full service studies and, to a lesser extent, our functional service provider offering have been impacted, and we expect them to continue to be impacted, by a switch from site-based monitoring visits to remote monitoring visits, and reduced capacity of businesses that utilize our services or facilities we use to conduct our business during the pandemic. In our Commercial Solutions segment, we continue to expect impacts to be temporary and primarily relate to delayed decision making related to new business awards, delays or cancellations of existing projects, declines in field team visits to healthcare providers (“HCPs”), and travel disruptions.
 The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our future results will depend on future developments. National, state, and local governments may impose, and have imposed in certain areas, additional restrictions or may extend the restrictions already in place if the pandemic continues or if new waves of infection occur. The continuing spread of COVID-19 and the related safety and business operating restrictions could result in a number of adverse impacts to our business, including, but not limited to, additional disruption to the economy and our customers, additional work restrictions, and supply chains being interrupted or slowed. Also, governments may impose other laws, policies, regulations, or taxes that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Depending on the extent to which our customers continue to be affected, they could further delay or reduce purchases of services we provide. The effects of COVID-19 also could impact us in a number of other ways including, but not limited to, additional reductions to our profitability, fluctuations in foreign currency markets, the availability of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings, credit risks of our customers and counterparties, and potential impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill or other long-lived assets.
 Despite these impacts, we remain confident in our liquidity position, which includes cash on hand of $272.2 million as of December 31, 2020, and access to our revolving credit facility. We have also implemented cash conservation initiatives, including reducing operating costs, deferring certain payroll taxes and other tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2020, as permitted by various government stimulus packages in multiple jurisdictions, and entering into interest rate swaps to fix certain variable rate debt at lower interest rates.
 See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential impact of the pandemic on our business.

Our Market
 The market for our solutions is primarily the biopharmaceutical industry that utilizes outsourced clinical drug and medical device development and commercialization services. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the following market trends:
 Trends in clinical drug and medical device development. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the outsourcing of Phase I to Phase IV clinical trials, particularly in complex, high-growth therapeutic areas such as oncology. Additionally, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited infrastructure and resources, making them more likely to outsource their clinical development to contract research organizations (“CROs”). With increased funding, emerging biotechnology companies, which typically lack resources and infrastructure to conduct clinical trials, are a high growth segment for the CRO market. Within the overall Phase I to Phase IV clinical trial market, the Phase IV/post-approval/Real World Evidence sub-market represents an increasing area of spending. These pharmaceutical industry trends are increasing demand for outsourced research and development services from CROs. According to industry estimates, funding to the biotechnology sector has shown no signs of slowing down, remaining near all-time record highs.
 We estimate that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the market for CRO services for Phase I to Phase IV clinical development activities will grow at a compound average annual rate of 7% to 8% through 2023, driven by a combination of increased development spending and further outsourcing. We estimate the total addressable clinical development market to be approximately $94 billion, of which $46 billion was outsourced to CROs in 2020, including spending related to pass-through costs.
 Trends in commercialization outsourcing. We believe that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the market for contract commercial organization (“CCO”) services will increase at a compound average growth rate of approximately 4% to 5% per annum through 2023. We believe this potential growth is supported by: (i) significant biopharmaceutical sales and marketing budgets; (ii) a continuing shift toward specialty and more complex therapies requiring more complex and integrated sales and marketing execution; (iii) a robust funding environment, which provides capital to fuel development and commercialization spending, particularly for small to mid-sized companies; (iv) continued political scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, which is intensifying pressure for our customers to further reduce fixed costs by outsourcing; and (v) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to more strategic relationships, particularly where economies of scale can reduce costs.
 Increasingly challenging clinical development and commercialization environment. The biopharmaceutical industry is currently facing a number of challenges, including: (i) margin deterioration; (ii) reimbursement and provider access hurdles; (iii) fewer blockbuster and high profitability drugs; (iv) continued pressure from generic brand exposure; and (v) the consolidation of payers, healthcare systems, providers, and pharmacies. These challenges also make it more complicated to engage physicians and patients, making new product launches more difficult. At the same time, the industry is experiencing growing demand for specialty drugs, pressure to improve research and development (“R&D”) productivity, the transition of the healthcare industry worldwide from a volume-based to a value-based reimbursement structure, and growing political and pricing pressures. Existing approaches to address these challenges include reducing overhead costs, optimizing the deployment of marketing and field assets, and refocusing product portfolios around therapeutic areas with depth of presence and expanded market access capabilities.

Optimization of biopharmaceutical R&D efficiency. Market forces and healthcare reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other governmental initiatives, place significant pressure on biopharmaceutical companies to improve cost efficiencies. At the same time, the complexity, size, duration, and globalization of clinical trials has increased drug development costs. In an effort to reduce these rising costs, biopharmaceutical companies need to demonstrate a new therapy’s relative improvement in quality, safety, and effectiveness compared to the current standard of care as early as possible in the development process. Outsourcing to CROs allows biopharmaceutical companies to deploy capital more efficiently, quickly benefiting from CROs’ existing infrastructure and therapeutic expertise without having to continuously scale in-house development resources.
 Globalization of clinical trials. Clinical trials have become increasingly global as biopharmaceutical companies seek to accelerate patient recruitment, particularly within protocol-eligible, treatment-naïve patient populations without co-morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes. Biopharmaceutical companies are also increasingly seeking to expand the commercial potential of their products by applying for regulatory approvals in multiple countries, including fast-growing economies that are spending more on healthcare. As part of the biopharmaceutical approval process in newer markets, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets, regulators now often require clinical trials to include specific percentages or numbers of people from local populations, resulting in a combination of multinational and domestic clinical trials.
 Management of increasingly complex clinical trials. The biopharmaceutical industry operates in an increasingly sophisticated and highly-regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex clinical trial design expertise has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory, clinical trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints. In addition, the therapeutic areas where we have significant experience and expertise, including CNS, oncology, and other complex diseases, often require more complicated protocols than other disease indications. Many of these studies have longer durations due to these factors, resulting in demand for greater clinical trial proficiency and expertise in these therapeutic areas, particularly in light of new methods such as the use of biomarkers and gene therapy.
 Evolving commercialization outsourcing needs for large versus small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. The needs of large versus small to mid-sized customers are evolving differently based upon their distinct infrastructure and corporate commercialization goals. Large biopharmaceutical companies tend to have robust internal resources and generally are seeking to augment these resources with individual outsourced services on a brand-by-brand basis. Frequently, they are also looking to establish enterprise vendor relationships with volume considerations to support broader cost savings initiatives. Conversely, small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited product portfolios with fewer internal resources and less commercialization experience. As a result, these companies generally require the full spectrum of commercialization capabilities, what we call full service commercial solutions. Historically, their only viable commercialization option was to enter into licensing agreements or a divestiture, which often meant surrendering a significant portion of an asset’s long-term economic value. However, with today’s funding environment driving sufficient capital for product launch, we believe these companies are becoming more receptive to commercialization alternatives that allow them to maintain their independence.

Rapid adoption of remote and digital solutions. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a spike in the adoption of remote and digital solutions to facilitate continued healthcare delivery to patients and support to HCPs for our customers’ products. Site- and patient-centric solutions that have been on the rise, include risk-based and remote monitoring, home health, and virtual personal and non-personal outreach to medical facilities and clinics. In light of these trends, we have continued to invest in our Decentralized Solutions and Kinetic capabilities, supported by Dynamic Assembly. Decentralized Solutions is designed to speed clinical trial data collection, ease site and patient burden, expand available patient populations, and improve patient diversity. Kinetic is designed to digitally enhance our Commercial Solutions by synchronizing customer engagement across multiple personal and digital channels to provide real-time performance data and intelligence. As adoption of remote and digital solutions increases over the longer term, we believe these capabilities provide an opportunity for improved efficiencies that could help to offset the potential revenue impact from reduced travel and other reimbursable expenses.

Industry-leading principal investigator and clinical research site relationships. We have extensive, often longstanding relationships with principal investigators and clinical research sites. We believe quality site relationships are critical for delivering clinical trial results on time and on budget for our customers. Motivated and engaged investigator sites can facilitate faster patient recruitment, increase retention, maintain safety, ensure compliance with protocols as well as with local and international regulations, and streamline reporting. We have dedicated personnel focused on enhancing clinical research site relationships. We work with these sites in collaborative partnerships to improve cycle times and standardize start-up activities to drive efficiency.
 Diversified customer base with a growing number of preferred provider relationships. We have a customer base of over 600 customers that includes nearly all of the 50 largest global biopharmaceutical companies (based on annual investment in research and development). Additionally, our customer base is geographically diverse with well-established relationships in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We have several customers with whom we have achieved “preferred provider” or strategic alliance relationships. We define these customers as relationships from which we generate significant revenue and where we have executed master service agreements in addition to regularly scheduled strategy meetings to discuss the status of our relationship, and for which we serve as a preferred supplier of services. We believe these relationships provide us enhanced opportunities for more business, although they are not a guarantee of future business. With the acquisition (the “Synteract Acquisition”) of SHCR Holdings Corporation (“Synteract”), a company with a leading reputation among emerging biopharmaceutical companies, we have also enhanced our leading position for serving customers across the small to mid-sized (“SMID”) category, further diversifying our customer base and expanding support to the high-growth emerging biopharmaceutical segment. We continue to experience strong SMID demand, as evidenced by double-digit growth in our request-for-proposal volumes in 2020 as compared to 2019. 
 Highly experienced management team with a successful track record of delivering growth. We have a dedicated and experienced executive management team with significant experience and knowledge focused on the biopharmaceutical industry. Each member of our leadership team has 15 years or more of experience, including experience with biopharmaceutical companies, payers, healthcare systems, and outsourced services providers. This team has successfully grown our company into a leading biopharmaceutical solutions organization through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to increase our market share and improve our market position. We believe our end-to-end product development model, where clinical insights inform commercialization and commercial insights improve clinical trial design and execution, is unique to the industry. The key elements of our business strategy include:
 Further penetrate the large pharmaceutical market. We believe one of the largest opportunities to increase our market share and improve our market position is to further penetrate large pharmaceutical companies. Large pharmaceutical companies have increasingly focused on partnering with larger outsourcing vendors that offer a full suite of service capabilities. We have invested in expanding our global scale, breadth of services, and infrastructure to build up our service capabilities for this customer sector. The Merger also significantly increased the depth of our relationships with many of these customers, particularly as a functional service provider.
 12


Continued penetration of the small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical market. We are a leader in the small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical market, which is the fastest growing segment of the market, and we believe there is further opportunity to grow this segment. Small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have fewer internal resources, less existing infrastructure, and less clinical development and commercialization experience. This customer segment is attracted to our full suite of clinical and commercialization services, our Syneos One® offering, our therapeutic expertise and organizational alignment down to the CRA level, and our Trusted Process® operating model. Additionally, with the Synteract acquisition during 2020, we have further enhanced our leading position serving SMID customers, diversifying our customer base and expanding support to high-growth emerging biopharmaceutical companies.
 Bring differentiated solutions to the market and increase cross-selling opportunities. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers’ evolving needs as the only fully integrated provider of a full suite of services across the product development continuum. Our breadth of services enables us to provide customized solutions designed to successfully accelerate the time to market for our customers’ clinical or commercial projects. We believe sharing commercial insights during the early phases of clinical trials can lead to better informed decisions around clinical trial design and strategies. Similarly, we believe our therapeutic and clinical trial expertise can lead to improved decisions about regulatory and payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, field team development, and other steps that are critical to the commercial success of our customers.
 We believe that we have substantial opportunities to expand the reach of services that we provide to our existing customers. During 2020, 150 customers, of which 76 were also in our top 100 customers, utilized services from both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments, demonstrating that there is both market precedent and significant potential to sell additional services to our customer base. Given our past success in expanding the scope of services provided to current customers, we intend to further expand our business with our existing customers by cross-selling additional clinical and commercial services.
 Strengthen our geographic footprint. We have developed a global platform with a presence in all of the major biopharmaceutical markets and intend to further expand our business outside of the United States, targeting regions where we are underpenetrated and that offer significant growth opportunities. We have expanded our capabilities, existing relationships, and local regulatory knowledge, which we believe will continue to position us well for new customer wins in a wide array of markets. We have added geographic reach through both acquisitions and organic growth in areas such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and Europe, which we believe is critical to obtaining business awards from large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. We may also selectively identify and acquire complementary businesses to enhance our services, capabilities, and geographic presence.
 Capitalize on industry trends favoring outsourcing. Our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments are benefiting from specific industry trends that are expected to drive attractive growth rates. Global demand for biopharmaceutical products continues to increase, driven by expanding access to healthcare, increasing life expectancy, and the growing prevalence of chronic conditions in both developed and emerging markets. However, higher costs and increased complexity are driving our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We believe outsourcing both clinical development and commercialization services optimizes returns on invested R&D for biopharmaceutical companies. Further, as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector, we believe that the rate of commercial outsourcing may follow a similar long-term path as that of the clinical development market.
 13


Drive acceleration of commercial outsourcing with our Syneos One® offering. We believe regulatory approval is only the first step towards a successful outcome, as our customers cannot earn a positive economic return for their asset until they achieve significant adoption in the commercial marketplace. We believe our Syneos One® offering is uniquely positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial solutions to help customers optimize the development process of their products and maximize the return on their investment. In addition, Syneos One® enables multiple selling points along the operational timeline of product development. The need for a full suite of product development services is particularly strong with our small to mid-sized customers in the near-term, given their increased access to funding to bring a product to the market coupled with their limited internal resources. Large biopharmaceutical companies may represent a long-term opportunity if market pressures to reduce fixed-cost infrastructures further intensify. Given our strong relationships in both customer segments and our breadth of services, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the needs of both customer types.
 Meet demand for comprehensive commercialization solutions. Customer preference and the complexity of product development in the modern market is creating increasing demand for a full service experience for commercial customers. We believe a move to more integrated outsourcing will drive future growth and further diversify our revenue and backlog. This full service model creates a collaborative relationship, allowing for solutions that incorporate data and insights to drive patient-centric approaches. This combination helps achieve the customer’s goal of maximizing product performance while diversifying our Commercial portfolio, which we believe can drive more predictable revenue. 
 Successfully acquire and integrate companies and evaluate and pursue other strategic initiatives to augment our organic growth. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we regularly evaluate new opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives, including potential acquisitions, investments, dispositions, or other transformative transactions. 
 We acquired the following companies during 2020:
  
• | Synteract, a full service CRO, focused on the emerging biopharmaceutical segment. Synteract’s client base is primarily comprised of emerging biopharmaceutical companies, a segment in which we have growth opportunities. Synteract has more than 700 employees across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa that have supported more than 4,000 Phase I to IV clinical trials across 26,000 sites in more than 60 countries. The transaction provides significant revenue synergy opportunities, as we bring scale and new capabilities to Synteract’s existing and prospective customers while maintaining Synteract’s focus on the emerging biopharmaceutical segment. Building on our track record of delivering cost synergies, we will also leverage our global infrastructure and integration expertise to optimize operational efficiencies and drive improved margins.

Government Regulation
 The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations require the candidate drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval.
Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment
 In the United States, the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the EU and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization, similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA, and requirements vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asian countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the International Council for Harmonisation (“ICH”) Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) guidelines, which are enforced by the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and may be amended from time to time. 
 Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the United States, we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including GCP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the investigational drug or biologic must file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial conducted in the United States must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP regulations, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the United States can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND, or in the case of a medical device, an investigational device exemption. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
 24


In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:
  
• | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain review, approval, and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | monitor drug, biologic or device accountability at clinical research sites; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similar guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed”.
 We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines.
 In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain.
 Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment
 The safety of medicines continues to be monitored after drug product approvals and throughout their use in healthcare practice. Post-marketing safety surveillance is therefore also subject to FDA regulations as well as the EU Pharmacovigilance Legislation and other countries’ regulations.
 25


In addition, our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the United States and in every other country where such personnel perform work. In particular, these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on promotional spending. Additionally these laws, rules and regulations govern the manner in which the product may be promoted and the scientific exchange of information related to the product. Violations of these rules may leave us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers.
 Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the handling and distribution of prescription drug product samples are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further, we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates the distribution, record-keeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances.
 Our communications solutions offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA, Health Canada, the Department of Health in the United Kingdom, EMA and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as state agencies and other foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the United States among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.
 Regulation of Personal Information
 The confidentiality of personal information and records and the circumstances under which such personal information and records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business are heavily regulated by data protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern the collection, use, handling and disclosure of personal information and require that we adopt and maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. These laws and regulations also typically require the adoption and maintenance of procedures that facilitate the exercise of an individual’s rights with respect to the information about them. Examples of data protection laws and regulations to which we may be subject include Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”).

Intellectual Property
 We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for patents, trademarks and copyright protection in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process®, PlanActivation®, QuickStart®, ProgramAccelerate®, QualityFinish®, Shortening the distance from lab to life®, Syneos One®, Biopharmaceutical Acceleration Model®, Dynamic Assembly®, KineticTM, Syneos Health, and other corporate emblems. Although the duration of our intellectual property rights varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe that the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.
Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 24,310 employees. Of these, 23,704 employees were regular and 606 were temporary. An additional 758 contingent workers provided services for us.
 Our Culture and Values. Our Company culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Our shared purpose, Shortening the Distance of Lab to Life®, aligns our employees and the customers we serve. This purpose is surrounded by three agile-oriented values, designed to foster innovation, including Challenge the Status Quo, Collaborate to Deliver Solutions, and Passionate to Save Lives. We work hard and smart to speed much-needed therapies to those who need them most. This environment is fueled by a belief in caring for our collective wellbeing, which we refer to as Total Self. This belief enables employees to be their authentic selves at work, fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where employees are empowered.
 Safety and Health. The safety, health, and welfare of our employees are paramount to our Company. We work closely with our customers and regulatory agencies to continuously monitor our employees’ working conditions and implement measures to ensure their wellness. During 2020, in response to the COVID‑19 pandemic, we implemented extensive safety measures throughout our Company to protect our employees, enabling the organization to continue to work with customers pursuing innovative ways to get effective therapies to patients as quickly as possible. These efforts included adherence to stringent safety protocols for employees working at clinical study sites and the interim movement of our office-based staff to remote working environments. These efforts were further supported by extensive internal and external CEO-led communications making all stakeholders aware of the precautions taken to protect the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers, patients, and communities.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”). We strive to lead our industry in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) efforts. We believe that addressing complex healthcare challenges requires contributions from diverse viewpoints and an inclusive, equitable space where our employees are able to succeed to their highest potential. We strive to foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic, and gender diversity and other individual differences. Our policies prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender, religion, marital status, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. The emphasis placed on DE&I by the Company and by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is demonstrated by the inclusion of DE&I metrics in the materials for each meeting of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board.

As of December 31, 2020, 67% of our total workforce were women. Additionally, 57% of our management roles at Director level and above and 66% of our new hires in 2020 were women. Throughout 2020, 32% of our new hires in the United States were minorities. Our DE&I strategy is enabled by our DE&I Council, which was established in 2020, led by an executive leadership team member and comprised of employees who are representative of our global, regionally diverse workforce, that oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our Company. Throughout 2020, we formed and expanded several Employee Resources Groups (“ERG’s”). These ERG’s, which include Women, Black, Veteran’s, and LGBTQIA+, further honor and support our inclusive environment of Total Self through building and supporting internal communities. We also have several development programs dedicated to women in leadership, and actively partner with the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association on development and recognition programs. We have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several programs under which employees can report incidents confidentially or anonymously and without fear of reprisal.
 Recruitment, Retention and Development. The primary ways we recruit and retain employees are by (1) ensuring that our compensation and benefits are competitive in our industry and in local labor markets; and (2) ensuring our leadership and internal programs support our culture and values. 
 Our Global Talent Acquisition Team leverages numerous resources including industry networks, online and social media platforms, university relations, and industry-focused career events to source talent for open positions. Candidates are thoroughly screened and evaluated against job-specific skills, experience and education criteria.
 We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit programs using external market data and feedback from our Global Talent Acquisition Team, and have established processes in place to make necessary revisions. Our Total Rewards Team is introducing a new Global Salary Structure to drive consistent enterprise-wide compensation and job level practices.
 We have an extensive, award-winning training program that provides regulatory, business, foreign language, and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development and mentorship. Training is offered in online, self-directed sessions as well as group settings. Specific training highlights for 2020 include Unconscious Bias and Data Privacy training for all employees. 
 Forbes 2020 World’s Best Employers. The Company was named to Forbes list of the World’s Best Employers in 2020, ranking highest among our competitive set – biopharmaceutical outsourcing organizations. This recognition is realized just three years into the Company’s journey to create a leading insights-driven, product development organization that is fueled by top talent and a collaborative culture.
 Indemnification and Insurance
 In conjunction with our Clinical Solutions services, we employ or contract with research institutions and, in some jurisdictions, principal investigators and pharmacies on behalf of biopharmaceutical companies to serve as research centers and principal investigators in conducting clinical trials to test new candidate drugs on human volunteers. Such testing creates the risk of liability for personal injury or death of volunteers, particularly to volunteers with life-threatening illnesses, resulting from adverse reactions to the candidate drugs administered. It is possible that we could be held liable for claims and expenses arising from any professional malpractice of the principal investigators with whom we contract or engage, or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials. In addition, as a result of our operation of Phase I clinical trial facilities, we could be liable for the general risks associated with clinical trials including, but not limited to, adverse events resulting from the administration of candidate drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of medical care providers. We also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform through each of our service groups. For example, we could be held liable for errors, omissions, or breach of contract, if monitoring obligations have been transferred to us and one of our CRA’s inaccurately reports from source documents or fails to adequately monitor a human clinical trial resulting in inaccurately recorded results.
 28


We have sought to reduce our risks by implementing the following where practicable:
  
• | securing contractual assurances such as indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit or exclude liability contained in our contracts with customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors and principal investigators;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | securing contractual and other assurances that adequate insurance will be maintained to the extent applicable by customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors, principal investigators and us; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with various regulatory requirements, including monitoring that the oversight of independent review boards and ethics committees are intact where obligations are transferred to us and monitoring the oversight of the procurement by the principal investigator of each participant’s informed consent to participate in the study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our contractual indemnifications generally do not fully protect us against certain of our own actions, such as negligence. Contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with customers, and the terms and scope of any indemnification, limitation of liability or exclusion of liability varies from customer to customer and from clinical trial to clinical trial. Additionally, financial performance of these indemnities is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that any indemnifying party against which we have claims may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us.
 While we maintain a global insurance program including professional liability and other types of insurance standard to our industry to cover our liability while conducting our business activities and contracted services, including drug safety issues as well as data processing and other errors and omissions, it is possible that we could become subject to claims not covered by insurance or that exceed our coverage limits. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside the scope of, or in excess of, a contractual indemnification provision, beyond the level of insurance coverage or not covered by insurance, or in the event that an indemnifying party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations.
