ITEM 1 — Business
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “the Company,” “we” or “our” refer to A. M. Castle & Co., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires.
Company Overview
A.M. Castle & Co. (the “Company”) is a global distributor of specialty metals and supply chain services, principally serving the producer durable equipment, commercial and military aircraft, heavy equipment, industrial goods, and construction equipment sectors of the global economy. Its customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium- and smaller-sized firms spread across a variety of industries. Particular focus is placed on the aerospace and defense, power generation, mining, heavy industrial equipment, and general manufacturing industries, as well as general engineering applications.
The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operates out of 21 service centers located throughout North America (16), Europe (2) and Asia (3). The Company’s service centers hold inventory and process and distribute products to both local and export markets.

Industry and Markets
Service centers operate as supply chain intermediaries between primary producers, which deal in bulk quantities in order to achieve economies of scale, and end-users in a variety of industries that require specialized products in significantly smaller quantities and forms. Service centers also manage the differences in lead times that exist in the supply chain. While original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and other customers often demand delivery within hours, the lead time required by primary producers can range from several months to over a year for certain specialty metals. Service centers provide value to customers by aggregating purchasing, providing warehousing and distribution services to meet specific customer needs, including demanding delivery times and precise metal specifications, and by providing value-added metals processing services.
The principal markets served by the Company are highly competitive. The Company is focused on two key global end markets, aerospace and industrial. Competition within these markets is based on service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability, timely delivery, ability to provide supply chain solutions, and price. The Company competes in a highly fragmented industry. Competition in the various markets in which the Company participates comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a local, regional, and global basis, some of which have greater financial resources, and some of which have more established brand names in certain local, regional, and global markets served by the Company.
The Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to larger customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal with limited or no value-added processing.
In order to capture scale efficiencies and remain competitive, many primary metal producers are consolidating their operations and focusing on their core production activities. These producers have increasingly outsourced metals distribution, inventory management, and value-added metals processing services to metals service centers. This process of outsourcing allows the primary metal producers to work with a relatively small number of intermediaries rather than many end customers. As a result, metals service centers, including the Company, are now providing an expanding range of services for their customers, including metal purchasing, processing, and supply chain solutions.
The Company’s marketing strategy focuses on distributing highly-engineered specialty grades and alloys of metals as well as providing specialized processing services designed to meet very precise specifications. Core products include alloy and stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminum, titanium, and carbon. Inventories of these products may assume many forms such as plate, sheet, extrusions, round bar, hexagonal bar, square and flat bar, tubing, and coil. Depending on the size of the facility and the nature of the markets it serves, the Company’s service centers are equipped as needed with bar saws, plate saws, oxygen and plasma arc flame cutting machinery, trepanning machinery, boring machinery, honing equipment, water-jet cutting equipment, stress relieving and annealing furnaces, leveling and surface grinding equipment, CNC machinery, and sheet shearing equipment. Various specialized fabrications are also performed for customers internally or through pre-qualified subcontractors that thermally process, turn, polish, cut-to-length, and straighten alloy and carbon bar, among other things.
Procurement
The Company purchases metals from many producers. Material is purchased in large lots and stocked at its service centers until sold, usually in smaller quantities and typically with some value-added processing services performed. The Company’s ability to provide timely delivery of a wide variety of specialty metals products, along with its processing capabilities and supply chain management solutions, allows customers to lower their own inventory investment by reducing their need to order the large quantities required by producers and their need to perform additional material processing services. Some of the Company’s purchases are covered by long-term contracts and commitments, which generally have corresponding customer sales agreements.

Thousands of customers from a wide array of industries are serviced primarily through the Company’s own sales organization. Orders are primarily filled with materials shipped from Company stock. The materials required to fill the balance of sales are obtained from other sources, such as purchases from other distributors or direct mill shipments to customers. Deliveries are made principally by third party logistics providers using their fleets, some of which display Company-branding. Otherwise, common carrier delivery is used in areas not serviced directly by such third party logistics providers. The Company’s broad network of locations provides same or next-day delivery to most of their markets, and two-day delivery to substantially all of the remaining target markets.
Customers
The Company’s customer base is broadly diversified and therefore, the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer, or a few customers. The customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium- and smaller-sized firms.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 681 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 80 were represented by the United Steelworkers of America (“USW”) under collective bargaining agreements. Effective May 15, 2018, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 59 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland, Ohio. Approximately 21 employees at our Hammond, Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1, 2020, and expires on March 31, 2024. The Company believes its relationships with its employees and their representative unions are good.
