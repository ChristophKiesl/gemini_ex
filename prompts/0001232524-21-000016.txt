Our Commercialized Products
Neuroscience
Xyrem. Xyrem is a product approved by FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Xyrem, is a formulation of the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous neurotransmitter and metabolite of gamma-aminobutyric acid. 
Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurological disorder characterized by EDS and the inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. It affects an estimated one in 2,000 people in the U.S., with symptoms typically appearing in childhood.  There are five primary symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. While patients with narcolepsy may not experience all five symptoms, EDS, an essential symptom of narcolepsy, is present in all narcolepsy patients and is characterized by chronic, pervasive sleepiness as well as sudden irresistible and overwhelming urges to sleep (inadvertent naps and sleep attacks). Narcolepsy may affect many areas of life, including limiting a patient’s education and employment opportunities, and may lead to difficulties at work, school, or in daily life activities like driving, operating machinery or caring for children. Patients with narcolepsy may also suffer from significant medical comorbidities, including cardiac disorders, depression, suicide risk, anxiety, diseases of the digestive system and respiratory diseases.
Cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness, can be one of the most debilitating symptoms of narcolepsy. Cataplexy is present in approximately 70% of patients with narcolepsy. Cataplexy can range from slight weakness or a drooping of facial muscles to the complete loss of muscle tone resulting in postural collapse. It may also impair a patient’s vision or speech. Cataplexy is often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger or surprise. Cataplexy can severely impair a patient’s quality of life and ability to function. 
Xyrem was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy in 2002 and was approved for EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy in 2005. In October 2018, Xyrem was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in pediatric narcolepsy patients ages seven and older. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends Xyrem as a standard of care for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS associated with narcolepsy.
In an effort to reach more patients who might benefit from our oxybate products, we continue to implement initiatives such as outreach to prescribers who treat narcolepsy, physician/healthcare provider education, enhanced patient and physician support services and unbranded disease awareness programs for the public.
Our marketing, sales and distribution of Xyrem in the U.S. are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which is required by FDA to mitigate the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, abuse, misuse and diversion of Xyrem. Under this REMS, all of the Xyrem sold in the U.S. must be dispensed and shipped directly to patients or caregivers through a central pharmacy. Xyrem may not be stocked in retail pharmacies. Physicians and patients must complete an enrollment process prior to fulfillment of Xyrem prescriptions, and each physician and patient must receive materials concerning the serious risks associated with Xyrem before the physician can prescribe, or a patient can receive, the product. The central certified pharmacy must monitor and report instances of patient or prescriber behavior giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of abuse, misuse or diversion of Xyrem, and maintains enrollment and prescription monitoring information in a central database. The central pharmacy ships the product directly to the patient (or caregiver) by a courier service. 
We have had exclusive agreements with Express Scripts Specialty Distribution Services, Inc., or ESSDS, the central pharmacy for Xyrem, to distribute Xyrem in the U.S. and provide patient support services related to Xyrem since 2002. In July 2020, upon expiration of the existing exclusive agreements with ESSDS, we entered into new agreements with ESSDS with a two-year term. Our current agreements with ESSDS, which expire on July 1, 2022, may be terminated by either party at any time without cause on 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party. 
In 2020, net product sales of Xyrem were $1.7 billion, which represented 74% of our total net product sales.
Xywav. Xywav (formerly JZP-258) is a product approved by FDA for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy. Xywav is an oxybate product that contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem. In January 2020, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, for Xywav for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy and in connection with this submission, redeemed the priority review voucher, or PRV, we acquired in May 2018. FDA approved Xywav for this indication in July 2020 and we commenced the U.S. launch of Xywav in November 2020. The 92% reduction of sodium translates into a reduction of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 milligrams per day for a patient prescribed an oxybate product, depending on the dose. When patients start Xywav after a sodium oxybate product, Xywav treatment is 
initiated at the same dose and regimen as the sodium oxybate product (gram for gram) and titrated as needed based on efficacy and tolerability. The label for Xywav, unlike Xyrem, does not include a warning to prescribers to monitor patients sensitive to sodium intake, including patients with heart failure, hypertension or renal impairment. 
Narcolepsy is a chronic condition where patients, by virtue of their diagnosis, are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and disease, and the impact of sodium on cardiovascular health is well established. There is also broad scientific consensus that reducing sodium consumption, which is a modifiable risk factor, is associated with clinically-meaningful reductions in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk. Given that narcolepsy is a life-long condition, we therefore believe that reducing sodium intake vs. the standard of care by 92% each and every day is a significant advancement for these patients. Health care providers and patients who understand the increased risk of cardiovascular disease faced by narcolepsy patients and who have been educated on the meaningful reduction in sodium from Xyrem to Xywav cite that meaningful reduction as a key reason for prescribing or starting on Xywav.
In approving Xywav, FDA approved a REMS to cover both Xywav and Xyrem. The Xywav and Xyrem REMS have the same requirements for both products and is also distributed by the central pharmacy through exclusive agreements with ESSDS. 
In 2020, net product sales of Xywav were $15.3 million, which represented 1% of our total net product sales. Following the U.S. launch of Xywav in November 2020, approximately 1,900 patients were taking Xywav by the end of 2020. With respect to Xyrem and Xywav in the aggregate, average active oxybate patients on therapy was approximately 15,300 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Total net product sales of Xywav were offset by the cost of launch related co-pay coupons and a free product program for certain qualified patients. We expect to have broad commercial payor coverage within the first 6 to 9 months following launch. To date, we have entered into agreements with various entities and have achieved coverage for Xywav for over 60% of commercial lives.
Sunosi. Sunosi received FDA approval in March 2019 and was launched in the U.S. in July 2019 to improve wakefulness in adult patients with EDS associated with narcolepsy or OSA. Sunosi was also approved in January 2020 by the EC to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS in adults with narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) or OSA. We launched Sunosi in Germany for the treatment of narcolepsy in May 2020 and in Denmark in October 2020. We expect to continue the rolling launch in Europe as we secure pricing and reimbursement approvals in more European countries.
OSA, commonly referred to as sleep apnea, is a highly prevalent disease, and EDS, a major symptom of OSA, is characterized by the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness. Although positive airway pressure therapy, with its most common form being continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, has been shown to be an effective therapy for sleep apnea that frequently results in improvement in EDS in many patients, not all patients tolerate CPAP therapy and among those who tolerate CPAP, usage is highly variable. EDS may persist in people with OSA despite using CPAP. 
In 2020, net product sales of Sunosi were $28.3 million, which represented 1% of our total net product sales.
Oncology
Defitelio. Defibrotide, the API in Defitelio, is approved for the treatment of VOD, a potentially life-threatening complication of HSCT, and is in development for other complications following anti-cancer treatment. Defibrotide is the sodium salt of a complex mixture of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine DNA. Defibrotide mediates its effects via interaction with endothelial cells. Non-clinical data suggest that defibrotide stabilizes endothelial cells by reducing endothelial cell activation and by protecting them from further damage.
Stem cell transplantation is a frequently used treatment modality for hematologic cancers and other conditions in both adults and children. Certain conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT can damage the cells that line the hepatic vessels, which is thought to lead to the development of VOD, also referred to as SOS, a blockage of the small vessels in the liver, that can lead to liver failure and potentially result in significant dysfunction in other organs such as the kidneys and lungs. Severe VOD is the most extreme form of VOD and is associated with multi-organ failure and high rates of morbidity and mortality. An analysis of retrospective data, prospective cohort studies and clinical trials published between 1979 and 2007 found that the 100-day mortality rate in severe VOD cases is greater than 80%. 
The EC granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for Defitelio for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT in 2013. We commenced a rolling launch of Defitelio in European countries in 2014. 
In 2016, FDA approved our NDA for Defitelio for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT. We launched Defitelio in the U.S. shortly after FDA approval. We also launched defibrotide in Canada in 2017. In June 2019, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., the partner to whom we have granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize defibrotide in Japan, received marketing authorization from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and launched defibrotide in Japan in September 2019. Further geographic expansion occurred in July 2020 and 
September 2020, as Defitelio was approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Swissmedic in Switzerland, respectively, for the treatment of VOD.
In 2020, Defitelio/defibrotide product sales were $195.8 million, which represented 8% of our total net product sales.
Erwinaze. Erwinaze (called Erwinase in markets outside the U.S.) is a biologic product used in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat patients with ALL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Originally developed by Public Health England, a national executive agency of the United Kingdom, or UK, Erwinaze is an asparaginase, a type of enzyme that can deprive leukemic cells of an amino acid essential for their growth. It is derived from a rare bacterium (Erwinia chrysanthemi) and is immunologically distinct from E. coli-derived asparaginase and suitable for patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived treatments. 
For ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, Erwinaze can be a crucial component of their therapeutic regimen. Current treatment guidelines and protocols recommend switching a patient receiving E. coli-derived asparaginase to treatment with Erwinaze if the patient’s hypersensitivity reaction to the E. coli-derived asparaginase is clinically meaningful, indicating that the hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in an intervention or interruption in infusion occurring in the patient’s treatment regimen. While treatment protocols for pediatric, adolescent and young adult (up to age 39) patients commonly include asparaginase, adult protocols do not. 
First approved by FDA under a biologics license application, or BLA, for administration via intramuscular injection in conjunction with chemotherapy, Erwinaze was launched in the U.S. in 2011. In 2014, FDA approved a supplemental BLA for administration of Erwinaze via intravenous infusion in conjunction with chemotherapy. 
Erwinaze was exclusively licensed to us for worldwide marketing, sales and distribution by Porton Biopharma Limited, or PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes our license to Erwinaze trademarks and manufacturing know-how, expired on December 31, 2020. Under our agreement with PBL, we have the right to sell certain Erwinaze inventory for a post-termination sales period of 12 months and retain ownership of certain data, know-how and other rights, including the BLA for Erwinaze in the U.S. and marketing authorizations for Erwinase in several other countries. During this post-termination period, PBL also manufactures the product for us and is our sole supplier for Erwinaze. We are obligated to make tiered royalty payments to PBL based on worldwide net sales of Erwinaze. Subject to successful receipt, release and FDA approval for the batches from PBL, we expect to distribute available Erwinaze supply during the first half of 2021. 
In 2020, net product sales of Erwinaze were $147.1 million, which represented 6% of our total net product sales.
Vyxeos. Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of a fixed ratio combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine for intravenous infusion that is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC and has been shown to have synergistic effects at killing leukemia cells in vitro and in animal models. Vyxeos is the first drug delivery combination product based on our CombiPlex technology platform to be approved by FDA and the EC.
AML is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow, which produces most of the body's new blood cells. AML cells crowd out healthy cells and move aggressively into the bloodstream to spread cancer to other parts of the body. AML is a relatively rare disease representing about 1% of all new cancer cases and has the lowest survival rate of any form of leukemia. Patients with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC may have a particularly poor prognosis.
In 2017, we launched Vyxeos in the U.S. after FDA approved our NDA for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. In August 2018, the EC granted marketing authorization for Vyxeos and, as part of our rolling launch of Vyxeos in Europe, we are continuing to make pricing and reimbursement submissions in European countries. 
In 2020, Vyxeos product sales were $121.1 million, which represented 5% of our total net product sales.
Zepzelca.  In furtherance of our interest in and efforts to expand our oncology therapeutic area, in December 2019, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Pharma Mar, S.A., or PharmaMar, pursuant to which we obtained exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca. 
Zepzelca for injection (4 mg) is approved by FDA to treat adults with metastatic small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Zepzelca is approved based on response rate and how long the response lasted. Additional studies will further evaluate the benefit of Zepzelca for this use.
Zepzelca was granted orphan drug designation for SCLC by FDA in August 2018. In December 2019, PharmaMar submitted an NDA to FDA for accelerated approval of Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC based on data from a Phase 2 trial, and in February 2020, FDA accepted the NDA for filing with priority review. In June 2020, FDA granted accelerated approval of Zepzelca for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. In October 2020, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with PharmaMar to expand our 
exclusive license to include rights to develop and commercialize Zepzelca in Canada. The term of the amended license agreement extends on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of: (i) expiration of the last PharmaMar patent covering Zepzelca in that country (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Zepzelca in that country and (iii) 12 years after the first commercial sale of Zepzelca in that country. We have the right to terminate the amended license agreement at will upon a specified notice period, and either party can terminate the amended license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. For a description of additional terms of the amended license agreement, including financial terms, see Note 3, Asset Acquisitions, Collaborations and Disposition—License Agreement of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
In December 2020 we, in conjunction with PharmaMar, announced results from the ATLANTIS Phase 3 study evaluating Zepzelca in combination with doxorubicin for adult patients with SCLC whose disease progressed following one prior platinum-containing line. The study did not meet the pre-specified criteria of significance for its primary endpoint. Key secondary and subgroup analyses favored the lurbinectedin combination arm. Patients received lurbinectedin at 2.0mg/m2 in the combination arm, which is lower than the FDA approved dose of Zepzelca at 3.2mg/m2. Lurbinectedin monotherapy was not tested in ATLANTIS. We anticipate initiating the Phase 4 study for the Zepzelca program, with an objective to provide critical data to complement the findings from the Basket trial, which supported the accelerated approval of Zepzelca.
In 2020, Zepzelca product sales were $90.4 million, which represented 4% of our total net product sales. 
Research and Development
A key aspect of our growth strategy is our continued investment in our evolving and expanding research and development activities. We actively explore new options for patients including novel compounds, small molecule advancements, biologics and innovative delivery technologies. We are focused on research and development activities within our neuroscience and oncology therapeutic areas, such as our expansion into movement disorders and solid tumors, and exploring and investing in adjacent therapeutic areas that could further diversify our portfolio.
Our development activities encompass all stages of development and currently include clinical testing of new product candidates and activities related to clinical improvements of, or additional indications or new clinical data for, our existing marketed products. We have also expanded into preclinical exploration of novel therapies primarily through external research collaborations, including precision medicines in hematology and oncology. We are increasingly leveraging our growing research and development function, and have supported additional investigator-sponsored trials that will generate additional data related to our products. We have a number of licensing and collaboration agreements with third parties, including biotechnology companies, academic institutions and research-based companies and institutions,related to preclinical and clinical research and development activities in hematology and in precision oncology, as well as in neuroscience.
Our current and planned development activities in our neuroscience therapeutic area are focused on JZP-258 for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia, JZP-385, JZP-150 and JZP-324, as well as exploring additional indications for Sunosi. 
JZP-258 for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. In October 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating JZP-258 in adult patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, a chronic, neurological disorder that is primarily characterized by EDS and that currently has no approved therapies in the U.S. We completed the rolling submission of a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, in February 2021, and if approved by FDA in a timely manner, we expect a potential launch of JZP-258 in the fourth quarter of 2021. FDA granted Fast Track designation for JZP-258 for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in September 2020. 
JZP-385. JZP-385 is a T-type calcium channel modulator that is a small molecule currently in development for the treatment of essential tremor. We acquired JZP-385 in our acquisition of Cavion, Inc., or Cavion, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, in August 2019. We expect to initiate a Phase 2b study of JZP-385 in mid-year 2021.
JZP-150. JZP-150 is a FAAH inhibitor program for the potential treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and associated symptoms. In October 2020, we entered into an asset purchase and exclusive license agreement with SpringWorks, under which we acquired SpringWorks’ FAAH inhibitor program, including an assignment of SpringWorks’ proprietary FAAH inhibitor PF-04457845, or PF-’845, now named JZP-150. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 study of JZP-150 in late 2021.
JZP-324. We are also pursuing early-stage activities related to the development of JZP-324, an extended-release low sodium, oxybate formulation that we believe could provide a clinically meaningful option for narcolepsy patients.
Our current and planned research and development activities in our oncology therapeutic area are focused on JZP-458, exploring additional indications for Defitelio and Vyxeos, generating additional clinical data for Zepzelca and Vyxeos, including in combination with other therapeutic agents, and the research and development of new product candidates through our external collaborations. 
JZP-458. JZP-458 is a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase that uses a novel Pseudomonas fluorescens expression platform, which is being developed for use as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen in the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma, or LBL, who are hypersensitive to E. coli-derived asparaginase products. JZP-458 was granted Fast Track designation by FDA in October 2019 for the treatment of this patient population, and in December 2019, the first patient was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical study for JZP-458 conducted in collaboration with the Children’s Oncology Group. In December 2020, we initiated the submission of a BLA to FDA for JZP-458 under Real-Time Oncology Review, or RTOR, pilot program, with the potential approval and launch in the U.S. in mid-year of 2021. 
Defitelio. Our Defitelio clinical development strategy generally focuses on the prevention and treatment of serious diseases associated with stem cell transplantation and endothelial cell damage. 
Vyxeos. Our Vyxeos clinical development strategy is designed to target potential new patient segments across the AML landscape and to generate clinical data on Vyxeos when used in combination with other therapeutic agents. As reflected in the table below, we are pursuing this strategy by sponsoring clinical trials, working with cooperative groups who are conducting clinical trials, and partnering with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson. In August 2018, we announced a five-year collaboration with MD Anderson to evaluate potential treatment options for hematologic malignancies, with a near-term focus on Vyxeos, and shortly thereafter, commenced development activities under this collaboration. In addition, there are multiple ongoing investigator-sponsored trials studying Vyxeos. 
Zepzelca. We anticipate the initiation in 2021 of a Phase 3 study evaluating Zepzelca in combination with immunotherapy versus immunotherapy alone in patients with extensive-stage SCLC after induction chemotherapy.
CombiPlex Platform. We are also evaluating the use of our CombiPlex delivery technology platform in a number of therapeutic combinations in oncology as part of our internal oncology research and development activities. CombiPlex enables the design and rapid evaluation of various combinations of therapies to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity by identifying an optimal synergistic ratio of drugs in vitro and fixing this ratio in a nanoscale delivery complex that maintains and then coordinates the release of the synergistic combination after administration.  CombiPlex utilizes two proprietary nanoscale delivery platforms: liposomes to control the release and distribution of water-soluble drugs and drugs that are both water- and fat-soluble (amphipathic), and nanoparticles to control the release and distribution of non-water-soluble (hydrophobic) drugs.
Through third parties, we are also pursuing preclinical and clinical research and development activities in hematology and in precision oncology under a number of licensing and collaboration agreements, including with:
•Codiak BioSciences, Inc., or Codiak, for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize potential therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak's engEx™ precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics; 
•Pfenex, Inc., which was acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand, for rights to an early-stage long-acting Erwinia asparaginase and an option to negotiate a license for a recombinant pegaspargase product candidate; 
•XL-protein GmbH, or XLp, for rights to use XLp’s PASylation® technology to extend the plasma half-life of selected asparaginase product candidates; and
•Redx Pharma, or Redx, for preclinical collaboration activities related to the pan-Raf inhibitor program that we purchased from Redx for the potential treatment of Raf and Ras mutant tumors and to discover and develop drug candidates for two cancer targets in the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway.
Below is a summary of our key ongoing and planned development projects related to our products and pipeline and their corresponding current stages of development:

As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote data monitoring where possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve study integrity. Although we have seen limited COVID-19-related impact to our mid- and late-stage clinical trial activity, despite delays in initiating trial sites, if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic become more severe, we could experience significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trial activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—COVID-19 Business Update” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
For 2021 and beyond, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase from previous levels, particularly as we prepare for anticipated regulatory submissions and data read-outs from clinical trials, initiate and undertake additional clinical trials and related development work and potentially acquire rights to additional product candidates.
Subsequent Events
GW Transaction Agreement
On February 3, 2021, we announced that we have entered into the GW Transaction Agreement with GW, under which a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, Acquisition Sub, agreed to acquire GW. The GW Transaction Agreement provides, among other things, that subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the GW Transaction Agreement, Acquisition Sub will acquire the entire issued share capital of GW pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006, or Scheme of Arrangement, which we refer to as the GW Acquisition. 
Under the GW Transaction Agreement, at the effective time of the Scheme of Arrangement, all GW ordinary shares issued and outstanding will be transferred to Acquisition Sub, and the holders of GW ordinary shares will have the right to receive, for each such share, (a) $16.66⁄ in cash and (b) an amount of our ordinary shares determined based on the exchange ratio, which exchange ratio will be determined as follows: 
•If the volume-weighted average sales price of our ordinary shares, as determined in accordance with the GW Transaction Agreement, or the Defined VWAP, is greater than $139.72 but less than $170.76, the exchange ratio will be an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $1.66⁄ by (y) the Defined VWAP;
•If the Defined VWAP is equal to or less than $139.72, the exchange ratio will be 0.011929; or
•If the Defined VWAP is an amount equal to or greater than $170.76, the exchange ratio will be 0.009760.
Because each American Depositary Share in GW, or GW ADSs, represents a beneficial interest in 12 GW ordinary shares, holders of GW ADSs will be entitled to receive 12 times the foregoing cash and share amounts, or (1) $200 in cash and (2) $20 in the form of our ordinary shares with the actual number of our ordinary shares being determined based on the exchange ratio set out above. The total consideration to be paid by us for the entire issued share capital of GW is approximately $7.2 billion. 
The respective obligations of GW and us to consummate the GW Acquisition are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary conditions, including the approval by GW’s shareholders of the Scheme of Arrangement, obtaining certain regulatory approvals, including expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and obtaining sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. The GW Acquisition is not subject to approval by our shareholders, nor is the GW Acquisition subject to a financing contingency. The GW Acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the GW Transaction Agreement. The GW Transaction Agreement contains customary representations and warranties given by GW and us, covenants regarding the conduct of GW’s business prior to the consummation of the GW Acquisition, termination rights and other customary provisions. 
Financing Commitment
On February 3, 2021, in connection with the execution of the GW Transaction Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter with BofA Securities, Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. pursuant to which these commitment parties have committed to provide us with a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million, a senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3,150.0 million and a senior secured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2,200.0 million to, among other things, finance our obligations in respect of the GW Acquisition. The effectiveness of such credit facilities is subject to the occurrence of customary closing conditions, including the consummation of the GW Acquisition.
Commercialization Activities
We have commercial operations primarily in the U.S., Europe and Canada. In the U.S., our products are commercialized through a number of teams, including a team of experienced, trained sales professionals who provide education and promote 
Xyrem, Xywav, Sunosi, Defitelio, Erwinaze, Vyxeos and Zepzelca to healthcare providers in the appropriate specialties for each product, a team that interacts with payors and institutions to ensure access and coverage for the products, and a team that distributes the products throughout the U.S. healthcare system (wholesalers, pharmacies, hospitals, and community and academic institutions) and provides patient services.
In Canada and in approved markets in Europe where we commercialize Defitelio, Erwinase and Vyxeos, we have a field force of hematology sales specialists. In markets where these products either are not approved or are unable to be promoted under local regulation, we have medical affairs personnel responsible for responding to medical information requests and for providing information consistent with local treatment protocols with respect to such products. In certain European markets, we have a sales team and a team of medical science liaisons supporting our rolling launch of Sunosi in Europe. Outside the U.S., we directly market Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. We also utilize distributors in certain markets outside the U.S. where we do not market our products directly. 
Our commercial activities include marketing related services, distribution services and commercial support services. We employ third party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. We also provide reimbursement support for our U.S. markets. 
We intend to scale the size of our sales force as appropriate to effectively reach our target audience in the specialty markets in which we currently operate. We promote Defitelio, Erwinaze, Vyxeos and Zepzelca to many hematology and oncology specialists who operate in the same hospitals, and we believe that we benefit from operational synergies from this overlap. We expect that a potential launch of JZP-458 in the U.S. or Europe would require minimal additional support. Continued growth of our current marketed products and the launch of any future products may require further expansion of our field force and support organization in and outside the U.S. In addition, beginning in March 2020, we transitioned our field-based sales, market access, reimbursement and medical employees out of the field and suspended work-related travel and in-person customer interactions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We utilized technology to continue to engage healthcare professionals and other customers virtually to support patient care. In late June 2020, as clinics and institutions began to allow in-person interactions pursuant to local health authority and government guidelines, our field teams resumed in-person interactions with healthcare professionals and clinics combined with virtual engagement. The level of renewed engagement varies by account, region and country and may be adversely impacted in the future as a result of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercialization activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—COVID-19 Business Update” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Human Capital Management and Environment, Health and Safety 
Jazz is committed to creating a company where the culture embodies our corporate purpose to innovate to transform the lives of patients and reflects our key goals: (1) be a great place to work; and (2) live our core values of Integrity, Collaboration, Passion, Innovation, and Pursuit of Excellence. 
Employee Demographics. As of February 16, 2021, Jazz employed approximately 1,940 people worldwide, of which approximately 1,250 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 690 were outside the U.S. in the UK, Ireland and across the European Union, or EU.  As an innovative biopharmaceutical company, we have over 400 full-time employees — greater than 20% of our global workforce — supporting our research and development activities. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We make diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, a priority because it is a key to unlocking the potential of our people and living our core values.
We strive to create a workplace culture that fosters the ability to be your authentic self and contribute boldly. We aspire to have multi-dimensional diversity through our entire Jazz workforce. We seek to surround underrepresented groups with allies to enable all employees to thrive equitably. Our Board and management team are committed to fostering DEI in all parts of our business.
Our DEI strategy includes: (1) building a more diverse workforce in terms of gender identity, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation and that represent unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents; (2) investing in developing our diverse talent and driving equity; and (3) and creating a culture of inclusion and belonging. 
We designed our Employee DEI program to empower employees to guide and support our strategy and programs related to hiring diverse talent and using education and communication to continue fostering an inclusive environment. We also have a DEI Delegation, a committee of employees focused on helping to embed DEI into all we do.
Jazz ConcERTos, our employee resource teams, are self-led teams of employee volunteers with diverse backgrounds who come together to promote innovation through inclusion and to increase awareness of all dimensions of diversity. We believe that these groups will contribute positively to Jazz’s culture and business success by working cross-functionally to drive 
innovation, helping to decrease unconscious bias, and encouraging employees to be their whole selves so they can perform at their best.
We have established goals related to increasing all dimensions of diversity, including representation of females and people of color, particularly at the leadership level (i.e., employees at executive director and above). In this regard, we have made some meaningful progress, as demonstrated by the following, as of February 16, 2021: 
•Approximately 40% of our board of directors is diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity. 
•45% of our Executive Committee are women. 
•Females represent 60% of our global workforce and 40% at the leadership level (employees at executive director and above).
•In the U.S., people of color represent 32% of our U.S. workforce and 18% at the leadership level. 
While we are proud of what we have accomplished to date, we recognize there is still much to do. We remain committed to furthering our goals of providing a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that is supportive of all backgrounds, including among our broader leadership.
Employee Engagement. Jazz has a strong employee value proposition anchored in our shared commitment to our purpose to innovate to transform the lives of patients. We are committed to ensuring that we create a rich culture that provides a great place to work for our employees through company-wide efforts to connect employees to our shared purpose and to create an environment where our people feel valued, respected, and able to contribute to their full potential. We believe employee engagement and the power of our employee voices is foundational to strong performance. We have transparent and regular communication channels with our employees consisting of many forms – including all employee meetings, regular communication messages from executive leadership, top leadership forums, pulse check feedback mechanisms and engagement surveys. 
Our employee feedback surveys are designed to help us measure overall employee engagement and we consistently achieve participation rates between 80 to 90%. We consistently have high levels of engagement measured by feelings of connection to our mission, Jazz as a great place to work where their well-being is supported and they feel valued and included. It also provides important insight into the areas where we need to focus in the year ahead for several key components of our company objectives, such as decision-making, opportunities for development, and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our survey informs programs and activities aligned with achieving our corporate objectives and achieving our goal of evolving our operating culture for agility and scalability.
Our Community Beat teams are employee volunteers and representatives that promote company culture and create a sense of belonging and camaraderie among our employees. They foster programs and engagement activities on a local level to draw better connections to employees with the company strategy and business milestones, give back through community service, and promote different health and well-being initiatives. 
Growth, Development and Total Rewards. We understand that empowering people to find new and better ways of doing things, to gain new experiences and to development new capabilities can also support our growth and achievements as a company. The exciting opportunities within our business provide rich and ample learning opportunities and experiences for career growth.
Our talent strategy focuses on attracting the best talent, recognizing and rewarding the performance of our employees as defined by both what they accomplished and how they accomplished it, and continually developing our talent through new experiences and learning opportunities. 
We recently launched a new performance management system to support our culture of learning, feedback, and continual growth. We encourage all employees to have an individual development plan to outline learning and growth interests and focus areas. We invest in manager and leadership development that emphasizes the important behaviors and values to successfully lead others and promote our culture. We offer tuition reimbursement in our major markets aimed at growth and career development.
Our management and leadership teams place significant focus and attention to diversity, capability development, and succession planning for critical roles. We regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions to successfully maintain business operations and develop a pipeline of talent. We have goals concerning employee retention, diversity, and talent development. 
We provide our employees with what we believe to be market competitive and locally relevant compensation and benefits that support our overarching strategy to attract, retain and reward highly talented employees in an extremely competitive and dynamic industry. 
We strive to create a culture of health and well-being throughout the organization by offering a diverse and customizable set of programs focusing on employee experience, self-care, work-life balance, flexibility and early intervention. In addition to traditional employee benefits, Jazz supports employees and their families through access to a suite of innovative programs that are designed to enhance their physical, financial, emotional and social well-being.
Workplace Safety & Employee Care During COVID-19. Workplace safety is always a top priority for Jazz. To create and sustain a safe and healthy workplace, we have implemented initiatives designed to address risk evaluation, education and training of employees, use of appropriate personal protective equipment, and compliance with relevant national and international health and safety standards. 
In response to COVID-19, we launched a new employee support framework focused on Care, Connection, Continuity and Consciousness (our “4Cs”) to enable our employees to live into our values and support one another while doing everything we can to deliver on our patient mission. Important to this framework were new leader expectations and tools given the rise and complexity of emerging employee demands and needs – including more flexibility to address personal needs, a greater connection to understand the whole person and their lives, and more active support surrounding social injustice. For example, we provided productivity and collaboration tools and resources for employees working remotely, including training and toolkits to help leaders effectively lead and manage remote teams; increased flexibility within work schedules and leave programs to support employees caring for children and others; expanded employees assistance and mindfulness programs to help employees and their families manage anxiety, stress, and overall wellbeing; and increased investment in resources focused on inclusion and belonging. 
Environment, Health and Safety. Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, in Italy and Ireland where we have manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of chemicals and solvents. Environmental and health and safety authorities in Italy and Ireland administer laws governing, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. In certain cases, such laws, directives and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination. 
We seek to operate our manufacturing facilities in an environmentally responsible way to protect our people, our business, our environment and the local communities in which we operate. In light of the potential impact of our business on the environment, we have adopted a number of internal environmental policies and management systems designed to manage our operations in compliance with applicable laws, directives and regulations on environmental protection and in support of environmental sustainability and local biodiversity. Our environmental policies and management systems include procedures for assessing compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and reporting incidents of non-compliance to applicable governmental authorities. For example, we have environmental policies governing both of our manufacturing facilities in Athlone, Ireland and Villa Guardia (Como), Italy, which demonstrate our commitment to environmental sustainability and require us to minimize resource use (e.g., energy and water) and waste generation, optimize the use of raw materials, and undertake continuous improvement in environmental performance, with an emphasis on pollution prevention.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete, and our product candidates may in the future compete, with currently existing therapies, product candidates currently under development by us and others and/or future product candidates, including new chemical entities that may be safer, more effective or more convenient than our products. Any products that we develop may be commercialized in competitive markets, and our competitors, which include large global pharmaceutical companies and small research-based companies and institutions, may succeed in developing products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. 
With respect to competition we face from generic drugs, certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available. Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold. 
In particular, our products and most advanced product candidates face or may face competition as described below: 
•Xyrem and Xywav. While Xyrem and Xywav are currently the only products approved by FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy, we and others 
have launched products to treat EDS in narcolepsy and may in the future launch products to treat cataplexy in narcolepsy that are competitive with or disrupt the market. In the future, we expect to face competition from authorized generic and generic versions of sodium oxybate. For a description of generic versions of sodium oxybate and/or new products for treatment of cataplexy and/or EDS that could compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, Xyrem and Xywav, as well as a description of our settlement agreements with abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, filers, see the risk factor under the heading “The introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products and product candidates would adversely affect sales of our oxybate products and product candidates” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
In addition to generic competition, Xyrem and Xywav may face competition in the future from other new sodium oxybate formulations for treatment of narcolepsy. In December 2020, Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc, or Avadel, announced the filing of a NDA for an extended-release formulation of sodium oxybate which uses its proprietary technology for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Avadel has also announced that it has obtained an orphan drug designation from FDA for its extended-release sodium oxybate formulation. To obtain approval with orphan drug exclusivity, Avadel will have to show clinical superiority to Xyrem and Xywav. We cannot predict the timing or approvability of Avadel’s sodium oxybate product candidate or how FDA will evaluate any clinical superiority arguments that either we or Avadel may make, but in any event, we expect to face competition from Avadel, if its product candidate is approved. 
Xyrem and Xywav may also face increased competition from new branded entrants to treat EDS in narcolepsy such as pitolisant, which has been approved by FDA for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy. Other companies have announced that they have product candidates in various phases of development to treat the symptoms of narcolepsy, such as Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.’s reboxetine, and various companies are performing research on orexin agonists for the treatment of sleep disorders. 
In addition, we are also aware that prescribers often prescribe branded or generic medications for cataplexy before prescribing or instead of prescribing oxybate therapy in Xyrem or Xywav, and that payors often require patients to try such medications before they will cover Xyrem or Xywav, even if they are not approved for this use. For example, prescribers often treat mild cataplexy with drugs that have not been approved by FDA for this indication, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. We are also aware that branded or generic stimulants may be prescribed off-label for treatment of EDS in narcolepsy. Wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil, including both branded and generic equivalents, are approved for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy and other conditions, and may be used in conjunction with or instead of Xyrem or Xywav. 
•Sunosi. Sunosi faces competition from existing branded and generic products that treat EDS or improve wakefulness in adult patients with narcolepsy or OSA in a competitive retail pharmacy market. To successfully commercialize Sunosi, we need to differentiate Sunosi from other branded and generic products that treat EDS in patients with narcolepsy, including stimulants, wake-promoting agents, such as modafinil and armodafinil, and generic versions of stimulants and wake-promoting agents. We are also aware that stimulants are prescribed off-label for patients to treat excessive sleepiness in OSA. Sunosi may face competition from new branded entrants such as pitolisant, a drug that was approved by FDA in August 2019 for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy and in October 2020 for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. Pitolisant became commercially available in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2019, and has also been approved and marketed in Europe to treat adult patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. Sunosi may also face competition from other products in development as potential treatments for EDS in patients with narcolepsy or OSA. 
•Defitelio. While there is currently no direct competition to Defitelio to treat severe VOD, changes in the types of conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT may affect the incidence of VOD diagnosis and demand for Defitelio.
•Erwinaze. While there is currently no direct competition to Erwinaze to treat ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, we and other companies have developed or are developing new treatments for ALL. For example, we initiated the submission of a BLA to FDA for JZP-458 (recombinant Erwinia asparaginase) in December 2020. Some new asparaginase treatments could reduce the rate of hypersensitivity in patients with ALL, and new treatment protocols are being developed and approved for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens, including some for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL patients. We have experienced frequent intermittent shortages of the product that have impacted prescribing habits for Erwinaze, including prescribers’ use of alternate methods to address hypersensitivity reactions. As a biologic product, Erwinaze also faces potential competition from biosimilar products. In April 2020, PBL announced that it had entered into an agreement with a new partner to commercialize and distribute Erwinaze after our license and supply agreement expired in December 
2020. Subject to successful receipt, release and FDA approval for the batches from PBL, we expect to distribute available Erwinaze supply during the first half of 2021.
•Vyxeos. With respect to Vyxeos, there are a number of alternative established therapies in AML. A key consideration in the treatment of AML patients is the patient’s suitability for chemotherapy. The AML patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial supporting our NDA included 60-75 year old fit patients, or those deemed able to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy. Prior to Vyxeos, the most widely recognized option for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML and AML-MRC in fit patients was cytarabine in combination with daunorubicin, known as 7+3, which is still used today in this population, along with other intensive chemotherapy regimens, particularly in patients under the age of 60.  Also, since Vyxeos was approved, several other products have been approved by FDA or are in development as treatment options for newly diagnosed AML patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy, such as targeted agents (e.g. midostaurin, enasidenib and ivosidenib), immunotherapies (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy), and agents disrupting leukemia cell survival (e.g., glasdegib). We are also aware of the increasing use of venetoclax combined with either a hypomethylating agent or low-dose cytarabine, a treatment approved by FDA in newly diagnosed AML patients who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. 
•Zepzelca. Zepzelca faces competition from topotecan, which is also an approved treatment in second line SCLC in the U.S., as well as other regimens for relapsed SCLC currently recommended in compendia guidelines. There are also a number of products and immunotherapies for the treatment of second line SCLC in various phases of development. 
An important part of our corporate strategy is to build a diversified product pipeline, including by acquiring or in-licensing and developing, or partnering to license and develop, additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential. Our ability to continue to grow our product portfolio requires that we compete successfully with other pharmaceutical companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial sales and marketing resources, to acquire or in-license products and product candidates. 
Customers 
In the U.S., Xyrem and Xywav are sold to one specialty pharmacy, ESSDS, that ships Xyrem and Xywav directly to patients. Also in the U.S., Sunosi is distributed through a retail channel consisting of numerous distributors who sell Sunosi to retail pharmacies. Defitelio and Erwinaze are sold to hospital customers through subsidiary specialty distributors of McKesson Corporation, or McKesson. Zepzelca and Vyxeos are sold to customers through subsidiary specialty distributors of McKesson, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, or ABC, and Cardinal Health, Inc., or Cardinal. We have distribution services agreements made in the ordinary course of business with McKesson, ABC and Cardinal and a pharmacy services agreement with ESSDS that provides for the distribution of Xyrem and Xywav to patients. For more information regarding our relationship with ESSDS, see “Business—Our Commercialized Products—Xyrem” in this Part I, Item 1. Purchases are made on a purchase order basis. 
In certain countries in Europe, Sunosi, Defitelio, Erwinase and Vyxeos are sold pursuant to marketing authorizations. We distribute these products through Durbin PLC, a UK-based wholesaler and distributor, and O&M Movianto Nederland BV, our centralized European logistics services provider, to hospitals and local wholesalers in Europe where we market these products directly and, in other markets in Europe and elsewhere where we do not market these products directly, to local distributors and wholesalers. In countries where there is no marketing authorization, Defitelio, Erwinase and Vyxeos are sold pursuant to named patient programs, temporary use authorizations or similar authorizations. 
We directly market Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Xyrem is also sold in 20 countries by UCB Pharma Limited, or UCB (which has rights to market Xyrem in 54 countries). 
Manufacturing 
We have a manufacturing and development facility in Athlone, Ireland where we manufacture Xyrem and Xywav, and a manufacturing plant in Villa Guardia, Italy where we produce the defibrotide drug substance. We currently do not have our own commercial manufacturing or packaging capability for our other products, product candidates or their APIs. As a result, our ability to develop and supply products in a timely and competitive manner depends primarily on third party suppliers being able to meet our ongoing commercial and clinical trial needs for API, other raw materials, packaging materials and finished products. Our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland currently continues to be operational with essential staff onsite and office-based staff working remotely. In March 2020, we temporarily ceased operations at our Villa Guardia, Italy manufacturing facility, which produces defibrotide, to ensure the safety of our employees and communities in northern Italy. We reopened the facility in the second quarter of 2020 taking into account applicable public health authority and local government guidelines as well as employee safety, and the facility has now resumed operations with essential staff onsite and office-based staff working remotely. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to rapidly evolve and even if our employees more broadly return to work in our global offices, the field and our manufacturing facilities, we may 
nevertheless have to resume a remote work model, whether as a result of spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection or hospitalization rates or otherwise.
Lead Marketed Products
Xyrem. Xyrem is manufactured by us in our Athlone facility and by Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., which we refer to together with its affiliates as Patheon, under a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Patheon Agreement, entered into with Patheon in 2015. We manufacture Xyrem in our Athlone facility for most of our U.S. commercial supply and rely on Patheon to supply Xyrem for other markets, though we are not required to purchase Xyrem exclusively from Patheon. The current term of the Patheon Agreement will expire in December 2022, subject to further automatic two-yearly extensions if Patheon is then providing manufacturing services for any product, unless either party provides prior notice of termination. In addition, we may terminate the Patheon Agreement for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice.
Siegfried USA, LLC and its European affiliates, or Siegfried, supply sodium oxybate, the API of Xyrem, to Patheon and our Athlone facility. Although Siegfried has been our only supplier of sodium oxybate since 2012, we have the right to purchase a portion of our worldwide requirements of sodium oxybate from other suppliers. The agreement with Siegfried expires in April 2024, subject to automatic three-year extensions until either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. During the term of the agreement and, under certain circumstances for 18 months after the agreement terminates, Siegfried is not permitted to manufacture sodium oxybate for any other company.
Xyrem is a Schedule III controlled substance in the U.S., and the API of Xyrem is the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, which is a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. As a result, Xyrem is subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA, and its manufacturing and distribution are highly restricted. Quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package sodium oxybate and Xyrem in the U.S. For information related to DEA quota requirements, see “Business—Government Regulation—Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation—Controlled Substance Regulations” in this Part I, Item 1.
Xywav. Xywav is manufactured at our Athlone facility. Xywav is a Schedule III controlled substance in the U.S., and the API of Xywav are the calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, which is a Schedule I controlled substance in the U.S. As a result, Xywav is subject to regulation by the DEA under the CSA, and its manufacturing and distribution are highly restricted. Quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium oxybate and Xywav in the U.S. For information related to DEA quota requirements, see “Business—Government Regulation—Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation—Controlled Substance Regulations” in this Part I, Item 1.
Sunosi. Siegfried AG is our sole supplier of both the API and finished product for Sunosi for both commercial sale as well as development activities. Although Siegfried AG is currently our only manufacturer and supplier of Sunosi, we have the right to purchase a portion of our worldwide requirements of API and drug product from other suppliers. Under our agreement, we provide periodic rolling forecasts to Siegfried AG, and a portion of each rolling forecast is binding. The initial term of the agreement with Siegfried AG will expire in December 2024 and will then be subject to automatic one-year extensions until either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. Solriamfetol, the API of Sunosi, and Sunosi were designated Schedule IV controlled substances by the DEA under the CSA. 
Defitelio. We are our own sole supplier of, and we believe that we are currently the sole worldwide producer of, the defibrotide API. We manufacture the defibrotide API from porcine DNA in a single facility located in Villa Guardia, Italy. Patheon currently processes the defibrotide API into its finished vial form under a specific product agreement entered into under a separate agreement with Patheon. Patheon is the sole provider of our commercial and clinical supply of Defitelio; however, we are not required to purchase Defitelio exclusively from Patheon. If Patheon does not or is not able to supply us with Defitelio for any reason, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another processor, and such delay could negatively impact our anticipated revenues from Defitelio and could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations with customers or to violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need.
Erwinaze. PBL is our sole supplier of Erwinaze. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes an exclusive right to market, sell or distribute Erwinaze, expired on December 31, 2020. Under our agreement with PBL, we have the right to sell certain Erwinaze inventory for a post-termination sales period of 12 months. Subject to successful receipt, release and FDA approval for the batches from PBL, we expect to distribute available Erwinaze supply during the first half of 2021. For information related to our expired agreement with PBL, see “Business—Our Commercialized Products—Erwinaze” in this Part I, Item 1. 
Vyxeos. Vyxeos is manufactured by Baxter Oncology GmbH, or Baxter, which is a sole source supplier from a single site location, using our CombiPlex technology platform. CombiPlex products represent formulations with increased manufacturing complexities associated with producing drug delivery vehicles encapsulating two or more drugs that are maintained at a fixed ratio and, in the case of Vyxeos, two drugs that are co-encapsulated in a freeze-dried liposomal format. Our manufacturing 
agreement with Baxter expires in August 2025, subject to automatic three-year renewal terms, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. While other contract manufacturers may be able to produce Vyxeos, the proprietary technology that supports the manufacture of Vyxeos is not easily transferable. The marketing authorization in the EU for Vyxeos also requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments. 
Zepzelca. Zepzelca is manufactured by Baxter. The initial term of the agreement with Baxter will expire in December 2023 and will then be subject to automatic two-year extensions, unless either party provides advance notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. PharmaMar retains manufacturing rights for the API for U.S. and Canadian commercial supply of Zepzelca. We also entered into a manufacturing agreement for ongoing commercial supply of the drug product Zepzelca with GP Pharm S.A.
Product Candidates 
JZP-458 is currently manufactured by Patheon, and the API of JZP-458 is manufactured by AGC Biologics A/S.
JZP-258 for idiopathic hypersomnia is currently manufactured at our Athlone facility, and we expect to manufacture this product commercially at our Athlone facility should this candidate receive regulatory approval. 
For discussion of the challenges we face with respect to supply of our products and product candidates, see the risk factor under the heading “Delays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek to patent, or to acquire or obtain licenses to third party patents, to protect our products and product candidates and related inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business. We own a portfolio of U.S and non-U.S. patents and patent applications and have licensed rights to a number of issued patents and patent applications. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including certain formulations, used to treat particular conditions, distribution methods and methods of administration, drug delivery technologies and delivery profiles and methods of making and use. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The patent laws of non-U.S. countries differ from those in U.S., and the degree of protection afforded by non-U.S. patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents. In addition to patents, our products and product candidates are in some instances protected by various regulatory exclusivities. For a description of those exclusivities and their regulatory background, see “Business—Government Regulation—Marketing Exclusivity—The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Part I, Item 1.
The patents, patent applications and regulatory exclusivities that relate to our marketed products include:
•Xyrem. We currently have six issued, unexpired patents in the U.S. relating to Xyrem. These patents are listed in FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” or the Orange Book. Our patents relate to Xyrem’s restricted distribution system and a drug-drug interaction, or DDI, between Xyrem and divalproex sodium. In October 2018, as a result of FDA’s grant of pediatric exclusivity, an additional six months was added to the original expiration dates of all of our Orange Book-listed patents that existed at that time. As a result, our Orange Book-listed patents have periods of exclusivity between December 2022 and September 2033. Some of our Xyrem patents have been subject to patent litigation with the companies who filed ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Xyrem, including challenge through the inter partes review, or IPR, procedures of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. Some IPR petitions were dismissed by the PTAB. However, in July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld on appeal PTAB decisions finding that six patents associated with the Xywav and Xyrem REMS and three claims of a seventh REMS patent were unpatentable. As a result, we will not be able to enforce patents or claims that the PTAB found unpatentable. Although we have settled all patent litigation against the nine companies that filed ANDAs, it is possible that additional companies may challenge our U.S. patents for Xyrem in the future. For a description of our Xyrem settlements, see the risk factor under the heading “The introduction of new products in the U.S. market that compete with, or otherwise disrupt the market for, our oxybate products and product candidates would adversely affect sales of our oxybate products and product candidates” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
A Xyrem formulation patent that had issued in multiple non-U.S. countries expired in December 2019. The European Patent Office has issued a method of administration patent relating to the DDI between Xyrem and divalproex sodium that will expire in February 2034. That patent is licensed to UCB as the marketing authorization holder outside of the U.S. and Canada, and UCB has the right to enforce it. In addition to our issued patents, we have patent applications relating to Xyrem pending in the U.S. and other countries. 
•Xywav.  We have U.S. patents and patent applications that relate to Xywav. Some of these patents expire in early 2033. In addition, we have patent applications that relate to Xywav for use in additional indications that would, if issued, expire between 2040 and 2041.
•Sunosi. We acquired worldwide development, manufacturing and commercial rights to solriamfetol from Aerial BioPharma LLC, or Aerial, in 2014, including Aerial’s patent rights relating to solriamfetol, other than in certain jurisdictions in Asia where SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. retains rights. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for solriamfetol relating to various compositions, formulations and methods of use. Four of our U.S. patents are method of use patents covering treatment of sleep-related conditions expiring between June 2026 and August 2027 and another U.S. patent is directed to dose escalation regimens expiring in June 2038. Two other U.S. patents cover, respectively, the formulation of solriamfetol and the method of treating select conditions with formulations of solriamfetol (both expiring in September 2037). A request for a patent term extension for one of the above method of use patents has been filed.  Requests for Supplementary Protection Certificate in certain European validation countries for a related European patent have been granted in Austria, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, and Sweden (expiring in June 2031) and remain pending in the others.  Sunosi has also been granted orphan drug exclusivity for narcolepsy and new chemical entity exclusivity in the U.S. 
•Defitelio. The unique process of deriving defibrotide from porcine DNA is extensive and uses both chemical and biological processes that rely on complex characterization methods. We have U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to various compositions, methods of use and methods of characterization, with the issued patents expiring at various times between April 2021 and November 2035. None of these patents are listed in the Orange Book. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by FDA to treat and prevent VOD until March 2023. Defibrotide has also been granted orphan drug designation by the EC and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD, by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health for the treatment of VOD and by the EC for the prevention of acute Graft-versus-Host Disease, or aGvHD. We acquired the rights to defibrotide for the treatment and prevention of VOD in North America, Central America and South America from Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2014. 
•Erwinaze. Erwinaze has no patent protection. It had been granted orphan drug exclusivity by FDA for the treatment of ALL in the U.S. until November 2018, and as a biological product approved under a BLA, we believe that it is protected by exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. In the EU, the regulatory data protection that provides an exclusivity period for Erwinase has lapsed. 
•Vyxeos. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for Vyxeos and the CombiPlex technology platform relating to various compositions and methods of making and use. These include seven U.S. patents covering Vyxeos compositions and methods of use expiring between April 2025 and September 2034 and two U.S. patents covering CombiPlex (which also cover Vyxeos) expiring in January 2027. These patents are listed in the Orange Book. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by FDA until August 2024, seven years from its FDA approval, for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. In addition, Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC until August 2028, ten years from its EC approval for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC.
•Zepzelca. In December 2019, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with PharmaMar pursuant to which we obtained exclusive U.S. development and commercialization rights to Zepzelca. In October 2020, we entered into the amended license agreement which expanded our exclusive license to include rights to develop and commercialize Zepzelca in Canada. We have a portfolio of in-licensed U.S. and Canadian patents for lurbinectedin relating to compositions, methods of use, and processes. For example, one U.S. patent (expiring in 2024) covers a genus of compounds, including lurbinectedin, and use in treating various cancers. A request for a patent term extension for this U.S. patent has been filed. Zepzelca has also been granted orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of adults with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy until 2027 and new chemical entity exclusivity until 2025 in the U.S. 
The patents and/or patent applications that relate to our product candidates include:
•JZP-385. Through the acquisition of Cavion in 2019, we obtained a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, including rights relating to compositions and methods of using JZP-385. The portfolio includes a U.S. composition of matter patent relating to JZP-385, which expires in 2027.
•JZP-150. Through the asset purchase and exclusive license agreement with SpringWorks in 2020, we obtained a license to a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, including rights relating to compositions 
and methods of using JZP-150. The portfolio includes a U.S. composition of matter patent relating to JZP-150, which expires in 2029.
•JZP-458. In 2016, we obtained worldwide rights from Pfenex, Inc., including Pfenex’s patent rights relating to JZP-458, to develop and commercialize multiple early-stage hematology product candidates, including a license to two U.S. process patents relating to JZP-458, with respective expirations in 2026 and 2038. Pfenex has been acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.
In addition, we have rights to a number of trademarks and service marks, and pending trademark and service mark applications, in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world to further protect the proprietary position of our products. For a discussion of the challenges we face in obtaining or maintaining patent and/or trade secret protection, see the risk factors under the heading “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Government Regulation
As a global pharmaceutical company, our activities are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., Europe and other countries where we do business. Regulatory requirements encompass the entire life cycle of pharmaceutical products, from research and development activities to marketing approval, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event and safety reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, pricing and reimbursement, recordkeeping, distribution, importing and exporting. Regulations differ from country to country and are constantly evolving. 
Testing and Approval of Pharmaceutical Products
We are not permitted to market a product in a country until we receive approval from the relevant regulatory authority, such as FDA in the U.S. and the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states. An application for marketing approval must contain information generated by the applicant, also called a sponsor, demonstrating the quality, safety and efficacy of the product candidate, including data from preclinical and clinical trials, proposed product packaging and labeling and information pertaining to product formulation and the manufacture and analytical testing of the API and the finished product. 
In the U.S., FDA reviews and, if warranted, approves applications for marketing approval. The process for obtaining marketing approval in the U.S. for a drug or biologic product candidate generally includes:
•conducting preclinical laboratory and animal testing and submitting the results to FDA in an investigational new drug, or IND, application requesting approval to test the product candidate in human clinical trials; 
•conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in the desired indication; 
•submitting an NDA, sNDA, or BLA, as appropriate, to FDA seeking approval for a specific indication; and
•completing inspections by FDA of the facilities where the product candidate is manufactured, analyzed and stored to demonstrate compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and any requested FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data supporting the application.
Human clinical trials conducted before approval of a product generally proceed in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate in humans, the product candidate is typically tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and side effects associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with specific protocols, as well as FDA requirements related to conducting the trials and recording and reporting the results, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, to ensure that the resulting data are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. FDA enforces good clinical practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites.
Once an NDA, sNDA or BLA has been compiled and submitted, FDA performs an initial review before it accepts the application for filing. FDA may refuse to file an application and/or request additional information before acceptance. Once accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the current goals and policies agreed to by FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for a new molecular entity, FDA has ten months from the filing decision in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority application. FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and in certain circumstances, the PDUFA goal date may be extended. 
FDA also has various programs, including Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy and Accelerated Approval (Subpart H and E), RTOR pilot program, that are intended to expedite the process for reviewing certain applications and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints or restricted distribution. Generally, products may be eligible for one or more of these programs if they are intended for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, have potential to address unmet medical needs, or may provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. For example, FDA granted Vyxeos Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations and also granted Priority Review with respect to our NDA for Vyxeos for the treatment of t-AML and AML-MRC that was approved in August 2017. In addition, a PRV may be used to obtain priority review by FDA for one of our future regulatory submissions. We used the PRV we acquired in May 2018 to obtain priority review for our JZP-258 for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia sNDA, which is under review by FDA. In June 2020, FDA granted Accelerated Approval to Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC. In December 2020, we initiated the submission of a BLA for JZP-458 for ALL under the RTOR pilot program.
During its review of an application, FDA evaluates whether the product demonstrates the required level of safety and efficacy for the indication for which approval is sought and also conducts the inspections and audits described above. FDA may also refer an application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a non-binding recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. When FDA completes its evaluation, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines what FDA considers to be the deficiencies in the application and may indicate that substantial additional testing or information is required in order for FDA to approve the product. If and when identified deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction after a review of the resubmission of the application, or if the decision is reversed through an administrative appeal, FDA will issue an approval letter. 
Even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on FDA’s interpretation of the data submitted in the application. For example, as a condition of approval, FDA may require the sponsor to agree to certain post-marketing requirements, such as conducting Phase 4, or post-approval, clinical trials to gain additional safety data or to document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under Accelerated Approval regulations. FDA’s approval of the BLA for Erwinaze includes a number of post-marketing commitments and requirements. Several post-marketing commitments and requirements were also mandated by FDA in connection with its approval of Defitelio, including the requirement that we conduct a clinical trial to analyze the safety of defibrotide versus best supportive care in the prevention of VOD in adult and pediatric patients, and its approval of Vyxeos, including the requirement that we conduct a safety study to characterize infusion-related reactions in patients treated with Vyxeos and a clinical trial to determine dosing to minimize toxicity in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. For example, FDA granted Accelerated Approval to Zepzelca for relapsed SCLC based on data from a Phase 2 trial, which approval is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a post-marketing clinical trial. 
In addition, if FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks, a sponsor may be required to include a proposed REMS (either as part of the application or after approval), which may include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits; a plan for communication to healthcare providers; or conditions on the product’s prescribing or distribution referred to as elements to assure safe use. Xyrem and Xywav are required to have a REMS. For more discussion regarding the Xyrem and Xywav REMS, see the risk factors under the headings “The distribution and sale of our oxybate products are subject to significant regulatory restrictions, including the requirements of a REMS, and these regulatory requirements subject us to risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem and Xywav” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
The EU and many individual countries have regulatory structures similar to the U.S. for conducting preclinical and clinical testing and applying for marketing approval or authorization, although specifics may vary widely from country to country. Clinical trials in the EU must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive, which may be replaced with the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation in 2022, and applicable good clinical practice standards. In the EU, there are several procedures for requesting marketing authorization which can be more efficient than applying for authorization on a country-by-country basis. There is a “centralized” procedure allowing submission of a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. If the EMA issues a positive opinion, the EC will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biotechnology-derived medicinal products, and optional for others. There is also a “decentralized” procedure allowing companies to file identical applications to several EU member states simultaneously for product candidates that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state and a “mutual recognition” procedure allowing companies that have a product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for that authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has, however, created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The impact of Brexit on the on-going validity in the UK of current EU authorizations for medicinal products, 
whether granted through the centralized procedure, decentralized procedure, or mutual recognition, and on the future process for obtaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the UK remains uncertain. In December 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA. The TCA primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of the TCA includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to the TCA. The Annex provides a framework for the recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, inspections and for the exchange and acceptance of official GMP documents. The regime does not, however, extend to procedures such as batch release certification. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. As part of the TCA, the EU and the UK will recognize GMP inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official GMP documents issued by the other party. The TCA also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The UK has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release for a period of at least 2 years until January 1, 2023. However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the UK must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use. As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain will have a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the EC.
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an application in the EU under the centralized procedure is 210 days, subject to certain exceptions and clock stops. An initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years, with renewal subject to re-evaluation of the risk-benefit profile of the product. Once renewed, the authorization is usually valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. 
In the EU, if an applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the product under normal conditions of use cannot be provided due to certain specified objective and verifiable reasons, products may be granted marketing authorization “under exceptional circumstances.” A marketing authorization granted under exceptional circumstances is valid for five years, subject to an annual reassessment of conditions imposed by the EC. The marketing authorization in the EU for Defitelio was granted under exceptional circumstances because it was not possible to obtain complete information about the product due to the rarity of the disease and because ethical considerations prevented conducting a study directly comparing Defitelio with best supportive care or a placebo. As a result, the marketing authorization requires us to comply with a number of post-marketing obligations, including obligations relating to the manufacture of the drug substance and finished product, the submission of data concerning patients treated with the product collected through a third-party patient registry and the establishment of a multi-center, multinational and prospective observational patient registry to investigate the long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio during normal use. We are in the process of conducting the post-authorization study in the EU to provide further data on long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio in normal use. 
Similar to the use of REMS in the U.S. to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks, in the EU and other countries we are required and may, in the future in relation to new products, be required to agree to post-marketing obligations in the marketing authorization for our products, to include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits, to implement a plan for communication to healthcare providers, and to impose restrictions on the product’s distribution. For example, the marketing authorization in the EU for Vyxeos requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments. 
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, modifying a REMS, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further regulatory review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the new intended use. Such regulatory reviews can result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.
Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and the third party suppliers of our products are subject to cGMP, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, recordkeeping and quality standards as defined by FDA, the EC, the EMA, competent authorities of EU member states and other regulatory authorities. FDA also periodically inspects manufacturing facilities and the sponsor’s and manufacturer’s records related to manufacturing, and assesses compliance with cGMP. Following such inspections, FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning 
letters. For example, FDA issued a warning letter to PBL, the Erwinaze manufacturer, in January 2017 indicating that it was not satisfied with PBL’s responses to a Form 483 issued to PBL and citing significant violations of cGMP for finished pharmaceuticals and significant deviations from cGMP for APIs. As recently as August 2018, FDA conducted an inspection of the PBL manufacturing facility and issued an FDA Form 483 to PBL citing observations related to items referenced in the existing warning letter as well as other manufacturing practices, including data and records management. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements may result in suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, withdrawal of the product from the market, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, among other enforcement remedies both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries.
In the EU, a manufacturing authorization is required to manufacture medicinal products, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing products and their APIs, including APIs manufactured outside of the EU with the intention of importing them into the EU. In addition to inspection reports, manufacturers and marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in cases of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to manufacturing.
Sales and Marketing of Pharmaceutical Products 
Advertising and Promotional Activities
FDA regulates advertising and promotional activities for products in the U.S., requiring advertising, promotional materials and labeling to be truthful and not misleading, and products to be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. FDA actively investigates allegations of off-label promotion in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. FDA routinely issues informal and more formal communications such as untitled letters or warning letters interpreting its authority over these matters. While such communications may not be considered final agency decisions, many companies may decide not to contest the agency’s interpretations so as to avoid disputes with FDA, even if they believe the claims they were making to be truthful, not misleading and otherwise lawful. 
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Other applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including laws that prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products and further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and to health care professionals. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. 
Fraud and Abuse
We are also subject to numerous fraud and abuse laws and regulations globally. In the U.S., there are a variety of federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Our sales, marketing, patient support and medical activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. The U.S. federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value to induce (or in return for) the referral of business, including the purchase, recommendation or prescription of a particular drug reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution and administrative sanction, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the U.S Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. Practices or arrangements that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. For example, in November 2020, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert to highlight certain inherent risks of remuneration related to speaker programs sponsored by drug and device companies, which do not fall under either safe harbor or statutory exception protection. The Special Fraud Alert sent a clear signal that speaker programs will be subject to potentially heightened enforcement scrutiny, in particular for those programs with certain characteristics identified as risk factors by OIG, including meals exceeding modest value or where alcohol is made available; lack of substantive or new content presented; programs held at venues not conducive to the exchange of educational information; repeat attendees or attendees without a legitimate business interest; sales or 
marketing influence on speaker selection; and excessive speaker compensation. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without providing specific intent to violate the statute, and may be punishable by civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties, damages, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. A claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of themselves and the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Violations of the False Claims Act may result in significant financial penalties (including mandatory penalties on a per claim or statement basis), treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to other federal false claim and statements laws, some of which extend to non-government health benefit programs. For example, the healthcare fraud provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third party payors, or falsifying or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of HIPAA fraud provisions may result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties, fines and damages, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
The majority of individual states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and the False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Other states restrict whether and when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to health care professionals or engage in other marketing-related activities, and certain states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. 
Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation
Safety Reporting/Pharmacovigilance
FDA, the EMA and other governmental authorities track information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. We are required to file periodic safety update reports with the authorities concerning adverse events. If, upon review, an authority determines that any events and/or reports indicate a trend or signal, they can require a change in a product label, restrict sales and marketing, require post-approval safety studies, require a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits and/or require or conduct other actions, potentially including withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. For example, if the EMA has concerns that the risk-benefit profile of a product has changed, it can, following an investigation procedure, adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be varied or suspended and requiring the marketing authorization holder to conduct post-authorization safety studies. The opinion is then submitted for approval by the EC. Also, from time to time, FDA issues drug safety communications on its adverse event reporting system based on its review of reported adverse events. 
FDA and the competent authorities of the EU member states on behalf of the EMA also periodically inspect our records related to safety reporting. Following such inspections, FDA may issue notices on FDA Form 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. An FDA Form 483 notice, if issued, can list conditions FDA investigators believe may have violated relevant FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in a warning letter or other regulatory enforcement action. Similarly, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee may propose to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that the marketing authorization holder be required to take specific steps. Non-compliance can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
Sunshine Act and Transparency Laws
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires tracking of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests held by physicians and their families, and reporting to the federal government and public disclosure of these data. Beginning in 2022, reporting will also be required of information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. A number of states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare providers in the states. Government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports. 
Outside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the EU, is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU member states, as described below in “Business—Government Regulation—Anti-Corruption Legislation” in this Part I, Item 1. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Certain EU member states, or industry codes of conduct, require that payments made to physicians be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Controlled Substance Regulations
A drug product approved by FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA depending on the drug’s potential for abuse.  Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently “accepted medical use” in the U.S., lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the U.S. may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse. The API of Xyrem and Xywav, oxybate salts, are regulated by the DEA as Schedule I controlled substances, and Xyrem and Xywav are regulated as Schedule III controlled substances. The API of Sunosi, solriamfetol, and Sunosi are regulated as Schedule IV controlled substances. Individual countries also impose similar requirements for controlled substances.
The DEA limits the quantity of certain Schedule I controlled substances that may be manufactured and procured in the U.S. in any given calendar year through a quota system and, as a result, quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package sodium oxybate and Xyrem in the U.S. Accordingly, we require DEA quotas for Siegfried, our U.S.‑based sodium oxybate supplier, to procure sodium oxybate and for Patheon, our U.S.-based Xyrem supplier, to obtain the sodium oxybate from Siegfried in order to manufacture and supply us with Xyrem. Xyrem and Xywav manufactured at our plant in Ireland enters the U.S. as a Schedule III drug and thus does not require a manufacturing quota.
As Schedule III drugs, Xyrem and Xywav are also subject to DEA import volume limits and state regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures, including limitations on prescription refills. In addition, the third parties who perform our clinical and commercial manufacturing, distribution, dispensing and clinical studies for Xyrem and Xywav are required to maintain necessary DEA registrations and state licenses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. 
Other Regulations
There are many other requirements and restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere imposed on pharmaceutical companies and their activities, including those related to the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes, the export and importation of products, required authorizations for distributors, the identification or licensing of sales representatives, restrictions on the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs, implementation of required compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct, protection of the environment, taxation and work safety. Non-compliance with such requirements may result in civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the UK Bribery Act. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other countries generally prohibit the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to U.S. or non-U.S. government officials in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure an improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including UK and non-UK government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the UK Bribery Act, companies that carry on a business or part of a business in the UK may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including UK and non-UK government officials and private persons in any country, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. As described above, our business 
is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with government officials in many countries. Additionally, in certain countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and similar laws. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, private individuals who report to the SEC original information that leads to successful enforcement actions may be eligible for a monetary award. We engage in ongoing efforts designed to ensure our compliance with these laws, including due diligence, training, policies, procedures, and internal controls. However, there is no certainty that all employees and third party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors, and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of our suppliers and other third party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits. 
Data Protection and Privacy
We are subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations globally, which restrict the processing of personal data. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve with an increased attention in countries globally that could potentially affect our business. In particular, we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective on May 25, 2018 and imposes penalties up to 4% of annual global turnover and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020. These laws and regulations applicable to our business, increase potential enforcement and litigation activity. In order to manage these evolving risks, we have adopted a global privacy program that governs the processing of personal data across our business. 
Marketing Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The marketing approval process described above for the U.S. is premised on the applicant being the owner of, or having obtained a right of reference to, all of the data required to prove the safety and effectiveness of a drug product. This type of marketing application, sometimes referred to as a “full” or “stand-alone” NDA, is governed by Section 505(b)(1) of the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, which includes the results of preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in addition to other information. As an alternative, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides two abbreviated approval pathways for certain drug products.
The first path, under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, usually is used for the approval of a product that is similar, but not identical, to a previously-approved brand-name product, referred to as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Under this path, the applicant is permitted to rely to some degree on FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective and must submit its own product-specific data on safety and effectiveness only to the extent necessary to bridge the differences between the products. The second abbreviated path established under the Hatch-Waxman Act is for the approval of generic drugs. Section 505(j) of the FDCA permits the submission of an ANDA for a generic version of an approved, brand-name drug. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and the RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. This data and information are provided instead of data and information independently demonstrating the proposed generic product’s safety and effectiveness.
The Hatch-Waxman Act requires an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant to certify that there are no patents listed for that product in the Orange Book, or that for each Orange Book-listed patent either the listed patent has expired, the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. A certification that approval is sought after patent expiration is called a “Paragraph III Certification.” A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s Orange Book-listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a “Paragraph IV Certification.” If a relevant patent covers an approved method of use, an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can also file a statement, called, in the case of an ANDA, a “section viii statement,” that the application does not seek approval of the method of use covered by the listed patent. With such a statement, the applicant must “carve out” the protected method of use (typically an indication and related material) from the proposed product’s labeling. If the applicant makes a Paragraph III Certification, the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA will not be approved until the listed patents claiming the RLD have expired. 
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV Certification to FDA, the applicant must also send a notice of that certification to the NDA holder and the relevant patent holders once FDA accepts the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for filing. The NDA and patent holders then have 45 days to initiate a patent infringement lawsuit. Filing the lawsuit triggers an automatic stay on FDA’s approval of the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months after the NDA 
holder’s receipt of the notice of Paragraph IV Certification, expiration of the patent, certain settlements of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. FDA may issue tentative approval of an application if the application meets all conditions for approval but cannot receive effective approval because the 30-month stay or another period of regulatory exclusivity has not expired. If an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA is approved before conclusion of any relevant patent litigation, the applicant can choose to launch the product, but does so “at risk” of being liable for damages, and potentially treble damages, if the RLD sponsor or patent holder ultimately prevails in patent litigation.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from statutory periods of non-patent marketing exclusivity that can potentially delay review or approval of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning a drug containing an active moiety that FDA has not previously approved. During this period, FDA cannot accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for a product containing the same moiety, except that an application containing a Paragraph IV Certification may be submitted after four years, which may trigger the litigation and stay described above. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity with the approval of an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, for a product containing a previously-approved moiety but that incorporates a change (such as a new indication, dosage form or strength) from an approved product with the same moiety, if the change required clinical data from new investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity does not preclude submission of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA for such a product, but prevents FDA from giving final approval to such product.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years (but not beyond 14 years from the date of approval) for an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, that is approved for a product that contains an active ingredient that has not previously been approved. The extension, which compensates for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process, is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of an NDA, and all of the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. It is available for only one patent for a given product, and it must be a patent that claims the product or a method of using or manufacturing the product. The USPTO, in consultation with FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension. 
In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier qualify for eight years’ data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years’ market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Drug and Other Exclusivities
Some jurisdictions, including the U.S., may designate drugs or biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the product and making it available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from U.S. sales of the product. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review process or lower the approval standards, but can provide important benefits, including consultation with FDA. If a product is approved for its orphan designated use, it may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which blocks FDA from approving for seven years any other application for a product that is the same drug for the same indication. If there is a previously-approved product that is the same drug for the same indication, orphan drug designation requires the sponsor to provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the approved product, whereas orphan drug exclusivity requires the sponsor to actually demonstrate clinical superiority. Clinical superiority can be established by way of greater efficacy, greater safety, or making a major contribution to patient care. Additionally, a later product can be approved if the sponsor holding orphan drug exclusivity consents, or cannot adequately supply the market. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent approval of another sponsor’s application for different indications or uses of the same drug, or for different drugs for the same indication. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by FDA to treat and prevent VOD until March 2023. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by FDA for the treatment of AML until August 2024.
Biologic products approved under a BLA are subject to the BPCIA, which authorizes an abbreviated approval pathway for a biological product that is “biosimilar” to an already approved biologic, or reference product. The BPCIA provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from competition by biosimilars. FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar cannot be licensed until 12 
years after the reference product was first licensed. We believe that Erwinaze, which was approved under a BLA in November 2011, is subject to an exclusivity period that will prevent approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. into November 2023.
Under certain circumstances, the exclusivity periods applicable to drugs and biologics and the patent-related protections applicable to drugs may be eligible for a six-month extension if the sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data. This exclusivity may be granted even if the data does not support a pediatric indication. We consider seeking pediatric exclusivity for our products whenever appropriate. For example, in response to a written request from FDA, we conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of Xyrem in children and adolescents aged seven to 17 who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, and submitted study results in a supplement to the Xyrem NDA, seeking approval for this indication. In October 2018, FDA approved the sNDA and notified us that we had been granted pediatric exclusivity, extending by six months the preclusive effect of our Orange Book-listed patents for Xyrem, as well as the three-year regulatory exclusivity period granted to the Xyrem pediatric indication because of the clinical studies that were necessary for approval of the sNDA.
In the EU, orphan drug designation may be granted to products that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives. Orphan designated medicinal products are entitled to a range of benefits during the development and regulatory review process and ten years of market exclusivity in all EU member states upon approval. As in the U.S., a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication may be approved, notwithstanding orphan product exclusivity, if the exclusivity holder gives consent or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity granted in relation to the original orphan medicinal product may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD, by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health for the treatment of VOD and by the EC for the prevention of aGvHD. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC until August 2028. 
Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access
Pricing and Reimbursement 
Successful commercialization of our products depends in significant part on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third party payors decide which drugs will be reimbursed and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels and conditions for reimbursement. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services by examining their cost effectiveness, as demonstrated in pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In some cases, for example, third party payors try to encourage the use of less expensive products, when available, through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement, co-pay and prior authorization policies. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may require prior approval before covering a specific product, or may require patients and health care providers to try other covered products first. Third party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. For certain categories of products, third party payors, principally through contracted pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers for inclusion of products on their formularies in specific positions or coverage criteria. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we have been entering into agreements with certain PBMs to provide rebates for our products where coverage was provided and products were listed in certain formulary positions, among other conditions. We expect to enter into additional agreements in 2021.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low‑income and disabled beneficiaries. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government covering individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B pays physicians who administer our products. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, as a condition of having federal funds made available to the states for our drugs under Medicare Part B, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and Medicare. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of 
recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. We are required to provide average sales price, or ASP, information for certain of our products to CMS on a quarterly basis. The ASP is calculated based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. This information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, with rates for Medicare Part B drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting and in the hospital outpatient setting consisting of ASP plus a specified percentage. 
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B program, or the 340B program, in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered drugs used in an outpatient setting. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. A regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities became effective on January 1, 2019. We also are required to report our 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis and HRSA then publishes them to 340B covered entities. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price to certain federal agencies that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts, which can change and evolve over time.
In addition, in the U.S., drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny, including with respect to companies that have increased the price of products after acquiring those products from other companies. There are numerous ongoing efforts at the federal and state level seeking to indirectly or directly regulate drug prices to reduce overall healthcare costs using tools such as price ceilings, value-based pricing and increased transparency and disclosure obligations. Several states have passed or are considering legislation that requires or purports to require companies to report pricing information, including proprietary pricing information. For example, in 2017, California adopted a prescription drug price transparency state bill requiring advance notice of and an explanation for price increases of certain drugs that exceed a specified threshold. Similar bills have been previously introduced at the federal level and additional legislation could be introduced this year.
 Similar to what is occurring in the U.S., political, economic and regulatory developments outside of the U.S. are also subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes and challenges. Pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels continue to exist. In various EU member states we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health technology assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally compares attributes of individual medicinal products, as compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. On January 31, 2018, the EC adopted a proposal for an HTA regulation intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products. The proposal, which currently continues its progress through the EU adoption process, provides that EU member states will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social and ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 
In the EU, our products are marketed through various channels and within different legal frameworks. The making available or placing on the EU market of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited. However, the competent authorities of the EU member states may exceptionally and temporarily allow and reimburse the supply of such unauthorized products, either on a named patient basis or through a compassionate use process, to individual patients or a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. Such reimbursement may no longer be available if authorization for named patient or compassionate use programs expire or is terminated or if marketing authorization is granted for the product. In some EU member states, authorization and reimbursement policies may also delay commercialization of our products, or may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. After initial price and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities in other countries. In the EU, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU member states.
For more information, including with respect to recent legal developments regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, Medicare Part B, and the 340B program, see the risk factors under the headings “Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products and we may be unable to successfully contract for coverage from pharmacy benefit managers and group purchasing organizations, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably; conversely, to secure coverage from these organizations, we may be required to pay rebates or other discounts or other restrictions to reimbursement that could diminish our sales,” “The pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition” and “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
Patient Copay Assistance and Free Product Programs
We have various patient programs to help patients access and pay for our products, including co-pay coupons for certain products, services that help patients determine their insurance coverage for our products, and a free product program. We also make grants to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients with their premium, and co-pay and co-insurance obligations. There has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, as well as reimbursement support offerings.
The OIG has established guidelines for pharmaceutical manufacturers who make donations to charitable organizations providing co-pay assistance to Medicare patients. Such donations are unlikely to run afoul of the anti-kickback laws provided that the organizations receiving donations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. In 2016 and 2017, we received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to our support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In April 2019, we finalized our civil settlement agreement with the DOJ and OIG, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement requiring us to maintain our ongoing corporate compliance program and obligating us to implement or continue, as applicable, a set of defined corporate integrity activities to ensure compliance with OIG’s policies around charitable contributions for a period of five years from the effective date of the corporate integrity agreement. 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Healthcare Reform Act, was intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the 340B program, and fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives.
Certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed 
into law in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Healthcare Reform Act remain possible. The nature and extent of any additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or judicial challenges to the Healthcare Reform Act are uncertain at this time.
