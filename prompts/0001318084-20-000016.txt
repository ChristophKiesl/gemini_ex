ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Core-Mark,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Company Overview 
Core-Mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in North America, providing sales, marketing, distribution and logistics services to approximately 42,000 customer locations across the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada through 32 distribution centers (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider). Our origins date back to 1888, when Glaser Bros., a family-owned-and-operated candy and tobacco distribution business, was founded in San Francisco, California. 
Our mission is to be the most valued marketer of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry. Consistent with this mission, our strategic framework is centered around three key initiatives: growing sales and margins faster than the industry, providing industry-leading category management solutions and leveraging our cost structure. We have also been successful in growing our business organically and through strategic acquisitions which have allowed us to expand our distribution network, product selection and customer base.
We operate in an industry where, in 2018, total in-store sales at convenience retail locations across both the U.S. and Canada were approximately $283.9 billion. In the U.S., total in-store sales at convenience locations in 2018 were approximately $242.2 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the prior year, based on the National Association of Convenience Stores (“NACS”) State of the Industry (“SOI”) report. Over the ten years from 2009 through the end of 2018, U.S. convenience in-store sales have increased by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2.9%. The most recent NACS Convenience Industry Store Count noted that the U.S. had approximately 153,000 convenience store locations as of December 31, 2018. Approximately 100,000, or 65%, of the convenience stores in the U.S. are considered independents with ten or fewer stores. In Canada, we estimate that total in-store sales at convenience locations in 2018 were approximately CAD $55.3 billion generated through approximately 26,000 stores, based on the Convenience Industry Council of Canada 2019 SOI report.
Core-Mark is one of two national distributors to the convenience store industry in the U.S. and is the largest in Canada. Our established national market presence rests primarily with our ability to service customers in every geographic region within the U.S. through 27 distribution centers and to service customers in Canada through our five Canadian distribution centers. We offer a wide array of products, marketing programs and services that leverage our scale to assist our customers in growing their business. Our leading category management strategies including our Vendor Consolidation Initiative (“VCI”), Focused Marketing Initiative (“FMI”) and “Fresh” products and food service programs have a proven track record of helping our customers grow their sales and profits at an accelerated rate. We believe this gives us a strong competitive advantage in the North American convenience retail industry.
Company Highlights
In 2019, we achieved the following significant accomplishments:

• | Record net sales of $16.7 billion.


• | Our net income increased 26.8% to $57.7 million.


• | Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.8% to $190.7 million.

Our growth has been driven primarily by our business strategies described more fully below. We believe these strategies have positioned us to continue to grow our approximate 7% market share of North American in-store convenience store sales, and to take advantage of growth opportunities with other retail store formats.
Business Strategy Overview
Our objective is to increase overall return to stockholders by growing faster and more profitable than our industry, being the industry leader in category management solutions and leveraging operating costs to increase profitability. As one of the largest marketers of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America with a track record of effectively selling into other retail channels, we believe we are well-positioned to meet this objective moving forward. Our business strategy includes the following initiatives, designed to further enhance the value we provide to our retail customers:
Fresh Products and Food Service. There is an increasing trend among consumers to purchase fresh food and food service products from convenience and other retail store formats. To meet this demand, we have modified and upgraded our refrigerated capacity, including investing in chill docks, and tri-temperature (“tri-temp”) trailers, which provide the infrastructure to deliver a significant range of chilled items including milk, produce, fresh and food service items to retail outlets. We have established partnerships with strategically-located dairies, fresh kitchens, food service providers and bakeries to further enable us to deliver premium consumer items such as fresh pizza, fried chicken, fresh made sandwiches, wraps, cut-fruit, parfaits, pastries, doughnuts, bread and home meal replacement solutions. We continue to promote our fresh products through the development of unique and comprehensive marketing and equipment programs that assist retailers in showcasing their fresh product offerings. We believe our investments in infrastructure, combined with our strategically located suppliers and in-house expertise, positions us as a leader in providing fresh food and food service products and programs to the convenience retail industry. Proper execution of our VCI program, the cornerstone being dairy distribution, provides Core-Mark the critical mass necessary to offer retailers a multiple weekly delivery platform, which facilitates the proper handling and dating of fresh products. We believe that fresh items are increasingly driving consumer decisions and will continue to be an important category.
Vendor Consolidation Initiative. We expect our VCI program will allow us to continue to grow our sales by capitalizing on the highly fragmented supply chain that services the convenience retail industry. A convenience retailer generally receives store merchandise through a large number of direct-store deliveries. This represents a highly inefficient and costly process for retailers. Our VCI program targets inefficiencies in the convenience store supply chain by offering the retailer the ability to receive multiple weekly deliveries for the bulk of their products, including dairy and other merchandise they previously purchased from multiple direct-store delivery companies. This simplifies the customer supply chain and provides retailers with an opportunity to improve inventory turns and working capital, reduce operational and transaction costs, and greatly diminish their out-of-stocks.
Focused Marketing Initiative. Designed to enhance our relationship with our independent customer base and to further differentiate us in the market place, our FMI program is centered on increasing the sales and profitability of the independent store through improved category insights, optimized retail price strategy and demographic decision-making, along with providing Core-Mark’s marketing solutions to create a comprehensive retail marketing strategy. We believe our innovative approach, which focuses on building a trusted partnership with our customers, has established us as the market leader in providing valuable marketing and supply chain solutions to the convenience retail industry.
Center of Excellence (“COE”). During the first quarter of 2020, we will open the COE at our Westlake, Texas campus. The COE is a dynamic collaboration space for leaders in the convenience retail channel designed to inspire, educate and challenge visitors to think big. Within the 14,000 sq. ft. space, we have created an environment that combines forward-looking consumer trends with real time data, which will allow us to align with our customers and define the future of convenience. The COE is physically designed with five unique hubs – Insights and Data Center, Collaboration Hub, Store Innovation, Culinary Test Kitchen and People Training Facility – to deliver an immersive experience for convenience retailers and strategic vendors.
Acquisitions and Expansion. We believe there remains a significant opportunity to increase our market presence and revenue growth through strategic and opportunistic acquisitions and the continued expansion of our facility infrastructure. We completed six acquisitions and added three primary distribution centers between 2010 and 2019, which expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. We will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing acquisitions that allow further leveraging of our geographic footprint and bring Fresh Products, Food Service and our other category management solutions to a broader customer base.
Competitive Strengths 
We believe we have the following fundamental competitive strengths, which form the foundation for our business strategy:
Innovation and Flexibility. Wholesale distributors typically provide convenience retailers access to a broad product line, the ability to place small quantity orders, inventory management and access to trade credit. Our capability to increase sales and profitability with existing and new customers is based on our ability to deliver consistently high levels of service, innovative category management and marketing programs, technology solutions and logistics support. We believe we are the best in class at capitalizing on emerging trends and bringing retailers our unique category management solutions such as fresh foods, food service solutions and healthier options, as well as our VCI and FMI initiatives.
Distribution Capabilities. The wholesale distribution industry is highly fragmented and historically has consisted of a large number of small, privately-owned businesses and a small number of large, full-service wholesale distributors serving multiple geographic regions. Relative to smaller competitors, large national distributors such as Core-Mark benefit from several competitive advantages including: increased purchasing power, the ability to service large national chain accounts, economies of scale in sales and operations, and the resources to invest in information technology and other productivity-enhancing technologies. Our wholesale distributing capabilities provide valuable services to both manufacturers of consumer products and convenience retailers. Manufacturers benefit from our broad retail coverage, inventory management, efficiency in processing small orders and frequency 
of deliveries. Convenience retailers benefit from our distribution capabilities by gaining access to a broad product line, optimizing inventory management and accessing trade credit.
Customers 
We service approximately 42,000 customer locations in all 50 states in the U.S., five Canadian provinces and two Canadian territories. Our primary customer base consists of traditional convenience stores, as well as alternative outlets selling consumer packaged goods. Our traditional convenience store customers include many of the major national and super-regional convenience store operators, as well as independently owned convenience stores. Our alternative outlet customers comprise a variety of store formats, including grocery stores, drug stores, mass merchants, liquor stores, cigarette and tobacco shops, hotel gift shops, military exchanges, college and corporate campuses, casinos, hardware stores, airport concessions and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products.
Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 40% of our net sales in 2019 including Murphy U.S.A., our largest customer, which accounted for 12.5% of our total net sales.
Products 
We purchase a variety of brand name and private label products, representing approximately 62,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), from suppliers and manufacturers. Cigarette products represent less than 5% of our total SKUs purchased. We offer customers a variety of food/non-food products, including, candy, snacks, groceries, food, including fresh products, dairy, bread, beverages, other tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, general merchandise, and health and beauty care products.

Cigarette Products. We purchase cigarette products from major U.S. and Canadian manufacturers. We have no long-term cigarette purchase agreements and buy substantially all of our products on an as-needed basis. Cigarette manufacturers historically offer structured incentive programs to wholesalers based on maintaining market share and executing promotional programs. Net sales of the cigarettes category declined 0.7% in 2019 to $10,892.7 million, accounting for approximately 65.3% of our total net sales and 23.0% of our total gross profit. We control major purchases of cigarettes centrally to optimize inventory levels and purchasing opportunities. Daily replenishment of inventory and brand selection is controlled by our distribution centers.
In 2019, our cigarette carton sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, which was partially offset by a 3.2% increase in the average sales price per carton. The decrease in carton sales in the U.S. was driven primarily by a decline in the general consumption of cigarettes, and the transition of certain Rite-Aid stores in the first half of 2018, partially offset by market share gains. The increase in the average sales price per carton was due primarily to increases in cigarette manufacturers’ prices and increases in excise taxes in certain jurisdictions.
In the industry overall, U.S. and Canadian cigarette consumption steadily declined over the last decade. Based on data compiled from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Economic Research Service and provided by the Tobacco Merchants Association (“TMA”), total cigarette consumption in the U.S. declined from 316 billion cigarettes in 2009 to 239 billion cigarettes in 2018, or a compounded annual decline of approximately 2.8%. Total cigarette consumption declined in Canada from 27 billion cigarettes in 2009 to 23 billion cigarettes in 2018, or a compounded annual decline of approximately 1.6% based on statistics 
provided by the TMA. More recently, a greater decline in total cigarette consumption has been offset by consumption of alternative nicotine products and OTP. Although we anticipate overall cigarette consumption will continue to decline, we expect to offset these declines through continued growth in our non-cigarette categories including alternative nicotine products and OTP, market share expansion and incremental gross profit from cigarette manufacturer price increases. We expect cigarette manufacturers will continue to raise prices for the foreseeable future as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their overall profitability.
Excise taxes are levied on cigarettes and other tobacco products by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments and are also imposed by various states, localities and provinces. We collect state, local, and provincial excise taxes from our customers and remit these amounts to the appropriate authorities based on the credit terms, if applicable, extended by each jurisdiction. Net sales and cost of sales includes amounts related to state, local and provincial excise taxes which were $3.3 billion for 2019, and $3.5 billion in both 2018 and 2017.
Food/Non-food Products. Our food products include food, candy, snacks, groceries, beverages and fresh products such as sandwiches, juices, salads, produce, dairy and bread. Our non-food products include cigars, tobacco, alternative nicotine products, health and beauty care products, general merchandise and equipment. Net sales of the combined food/non-food product categories grew 6.6% in 2019 to $5,777.8 million, which was 34.7% of our total net sales. The increase was driven primarily by incremental sales to existing customers and net market share gains. Sales generated from Fresh, VCI and FMI were the primary drivers of increased sales to existing customers. Our health, beauty & general category continued to benefit from the increasing popularity of alternative nicotine delivery products, which are included in this category. We believe, in the near term, the overall trend toward the increased use of alternative nicotine delivery products and other tobacco products will continue and offset the impact of the expected long-term decline of cigarette consumption. However, the regulatory environment surrounding alternative nicotine products is uncertain and the enactment of regulations and other laws at the federal, state and local level could have a material impact on the availability of and our ability to sell such products.
Gross profit for food/non-food categories grew $69.9 million, or 10.9%, to $711.8 million in 2019, which was 77.0% of our total gross profit. Our strategy is to continue to grow sales of food/non-food products through our category management solutions including Fresh and Food Service, VCI and FMI. In order to take advantage of the significantly higher margins earned by food/non-food products, two of our key business strategies, Fresh and VCI, focus primarily on the highest margin categories in the food/non-food group. We believe there is an increasing trend toward purchases of quality fresh food, “healthy for you” and food service items from convenience and other retail store formats. Combined sales of our Food and Fresh categories grew $116.0 million, or 5.4%, to $2,249.2 million in 2019 driven primarily by this trend, as well as net market share gains. Sales of OTP increased $51.7 million, or 3.7%, while the health, beauty & general category increased $135.7 million or 19.1%, driven primarily by the increasing popularity of alternative nicotine products.
Suppliers
We purchase products for resale from approximately 3,300 active trade suppliers and manufacturers located across the U.S. and Canada. In 2019, we purchased approximately 79% of our products from our top 20 suppliers, with our top two suppliers, Altria Group, Inc. (the parent company of Philip Morris USA, Inc.) and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, accounting for approximately 32% and 22% of our purchases, respectively. We coordinate our purchasing from suppliers by negotiating, on a company-wide basis, special arrangements to obtain volume discounts and additional incentives, while also taking advantage of promotional and marketing incentives offered to us as a wholesale distributor. In addition, buyers in each of our distribution facilities purchase products directly from manufacturers, improving product mix and availability for individual markets.
Operations 
As of December 31, 2019, we operated a network of 32 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider). Twenty-seven of our distribution centers are located in the U.S. and five are located in Canada. 
The map below depicts the scope of our operations and the names of our distribution centers.
We operate five consolidation centers which buy products from our suppliers in bulk quantities and then redistribute the products to many of our other distribution centers. The products purchased by our consolidation centers may include frozen and chilled items, candy, snacks, beverages, health and beauty care and general merchandise products. We operate two additional facilities as a third-party logistics provider dedicated solely to supporting the logistics and management requirements of one of our major customers, Alimentation Couche-Tard, Inc. (“Couche-Tard”). These distribution facilities are located near Phoenix, Arizona and San Antonio, Texas. 
Our proprietary Distribution Center Management System platform provides our distribution centers with the flexibility to adapt rapidly to changing business needs and allows them to provide our customers with necessary information technology requirements and integration capabilities.
Distribution 
As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 2,300 personnel in our transportation department, including delivery drivers, shuttle drivers, routers, training supervisors and managers, all of whom focus on achieving safe, on-time deliveries. Our daily orders are picked and loaded nightly in route sequence, with the majority reaching their destination within 24 hours. At December 31, 2019, our distribution fleet consisted of approximately 1,600 leased tractors and trailers and approximately 1,200 additional owned tractors and trailers. Our “tri-temp” trailer fleet gives us the capability to deliver frozen, chilled and non-refrigerated goods in one delivery and provides us the multiple temperature zone capability needed to support our focus on delivering fresh products to our customers. Substantially all of our trailers were “tri-temp” as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 16% of our trucks ran on Compressed Natural Gas (“CNG”), which allows us to reduce our carbon footprint and lower our transportation costs. We utilize seven CNG stations, two of which we own (located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and Corona, California). The other five are owned and operated by U.S. Oil (a division of U.S. Venture, Inc.) under the name GAIN Clean Fuel (“GAIN”) and are located in Aurora, Colorado; Forrest City, Arkansas; Sanford, North 
5

Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; and Tampa, Florida. In addition to providing fuel to our fleet, the GAIN stations are also open to other public fleets for fueling.
Competition 
Competition within the industry is based primarily on the range and quality of the services provided, price, product selection and the reliability of wholesalers’ logistics as well as proximity to the customer’s stores. We operate from a perspective that focuses heavily on flexibility and providing outstanding customer service, order fulfillment rates, on-time delivery, innovative marketing solutions and merchandising support as well as competitive pricing.
Core-Mark is one of the two largest wholesale convenience distributors (measured by annual sales) serving North America. We service both convenience store chain customers and independent operators with ten or fewer stores which comprise approximately 65% of the convenience retail store market. The McLane Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., our largest competitor, focuses primarily on servicing large regional or national convenience store chains as well as chain customers in other trade channels. There are two other large companies that primarily cover the eastern half of the U.S.: H.T. Hackney Company and Eby-Brown Company, a division of Performance Food Group. In addition, there are many local distributors serving small regional chains and independent convenience retailers. In Canada, in addition to Core-Mark, several companies make-up the competitive landscape. Wallace & Carey, Inc., has national distribution capabilities. Pratts Wholesale Limited, regionally serves the Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta markets. Sobeys Inc. is a large national convenience store and grocery wholesaler.
Beyond the traditional wholesale supply channels, we face potential competition from at least three other supply avenues. First, certain consumer product manufacturers such as Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, The Coca-Cola Company, and PepsiCo (including its Frito-Lay, Inc. division) deliver their products directly to convenience retailers. Secondly, club wholesalers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation and Sam’s West, Inc. (“Sam’s Club”) provide a limited selection of products at generally competitive prices; however, they often have limited delivery options and limited services. Finally, some large convenience retail chains self-distribute products due to the geographic density of their stores and their belief that they can economically service such locations.
We face competition from the diversion into certain U.S. and Canadian markets of cigarettes intended for sale outside of these markets, including the sale of cigarettes in non-taxable jurisdictions, inter-state/provincial and international smuggling of cigarettes, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, increased imports of foreign low priced brands, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes. The competitive environment has been heightened by a continued influx of generic products, tobacco, and nicotine alternatives that challenge sales of higher priced cigarettes.
Working Capital Practices 
We sell products on credit terms to our customers that averaged, as measured by days sales outstanding, about nine days for each of 2019, 2018 and 2017. Credit terms may impact pricing and are competitive within our industry. Many of our customers remit payment electronically, which facilitates efficient and timely monitoring of payment risk. Canadian days sales outstanding in receivables tend to be lower as Canadian industry practice is for shorter credit terms than in the U.S.
We maintain our inventory of products based on the level of sales of the particular product and manufacturer replenishment cycles. The number of days a particular item of inventory remains in our distribution centers varies by product and is principally driven by the turnover of that product and economic order quantities. We typically order and carry in inventory additional amounts of certain critical products to assure high order fulfillment levels for these items. Periodically, we may carry higher levels of inventory to take advantage of anticipated manufacturer price increases. The number of days of cost of sales in inventory averaged about 17 days, 14 days and 16 days, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cigarette category averaged 12 days, 7 days and 11 days, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The food/non-food categories averaged 27 days, 25 days and 29 days in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We obtain terms from our vendors and certain taxing jurisdictions based on industry practices, consistent with our credit standing. We take advantage of the full complement of term offerings, which may include enhanced cash discounts for earlier payment or prepayment. Terms for our accounts payable and cigarette and tobacco taxes payable range anywhere from three days prepaid to 120 days credit. Days payable outstanding for both categories, excluding the impact of prepayments, during 2019 averaged 10 days, while each of 2018 and 2017 averaged 11 days.

Employees
The following chart provides a breakdown of our employees by function and geographic region (including employees at our third-party logistics facilities) as of December 31, 2019:
TOTAL EMPLOYEES BY BUSINESS FUNCTION

 | U.S. | Canada | | Total
Sales and marketing | 1,505 | | 105 | | 1,610
Warehousing and distribution | 5,461 | | 424 | | 5,885
Management, administration, finance and purchasing | 900 | | 160 | | 1,060
Total for all categories | 7,866 | | 689 | | 8,555

Four of our distribution centers, Hayward, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Calgary, have employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Hayward, Las Vegas and Los Angeles) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (Calgary). Approximately 450 employees, or 5% of our workforce, are unionized. There have been no disruptions in customer service, strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns as a result of union activities, and we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.
Regulation 
As a distributor of food, nicotine and health-related products in the U.S., we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In Canada, similar standards related to food and over-the-counter medications are governed by Health Canada. The products we distribute are also subject to federal, state, provincial and local regulation through such measures as: the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state, provincial and local health agencies of relevant standards for the products we distribute; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are inspected periodically by federal, state, provincial and local authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) under the U.S. Department of Labor, which require us to comply with certain health and safety standards to protect our employees.
We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. and Canadian Departments of Transportation, and similar state, provincial and local agencies. Our distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada are subject to a broad spectrum of federal, state, provincial and local environmental protection statutes including those that govern emissions to air, soil and water, and the disposal of hazardous substances.
Our policy is to comply with all regulatory and legal requirements, and management is not aware of any related issues that may have a material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Trademarks 
We have trademarks including the following: Arcadia Bay®, Arcadia Bay Coffee Company®, Cable Car®, Core-Mark®, Core Solutions Group®, EMERALD®, Java Street®, SmartStock®, Pine State Convenience™, Taco Depot® and Farner-Bocken™.
Segment and Geographic Information 
We have two operating segments which aggregate into one reportable segment. We also present certain financial information by operating segment region — the U.S. and Canada. See Note 17 - Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality
We typically generate higher net sales and gross profits during the warm weather months (April through September) than other times of the year. We believe this occurs because the convenience store industry tends to be busier due to timing of vacations and an increase in travel during this period.
