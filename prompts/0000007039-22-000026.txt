Business Segments
We operate in two business segments; the manufacturing of various specialty petrochemicals products and the manufacturing of specialty waxes.
Our Specialty Petrochemicals segment is conducted through SHR, a Texas corporation. SHR owns and operates a specialty petrochemicals facility in Silsbee, Texas which produces high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging, polypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry. Our Specialty Petrochemicals products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container, and by ship. SHR owns all of the capital stock of GSPL, a Texas corporation, which owns and operates pipelines that connect the SHR facility to a natural gas line, to SHR’s truck and rail loading terminal and to a major petroleum products pipeline owned by an unaffiliated third party. SHR also provides custom processing services at its Silsbee facility.
Our Specialty Waxes segment is conducted through TC, a Texas corporation, located in Pasadena, Texas which produces specialty polyethylene and poly alpha olefin waxes and provides custom processing services. The specialty polyethylene waxes are used in markets from paints and inks to adhesives, coatings, and PVC lubricants. The highly specialized synthetic poly alpha olefin waxes are used in applications such as toner in printers and as additives for candles. These waxes are sold in solid form as pastilles or, for large adhesive companies, in bulk liquid form.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
In addition, on September 28, 2020, we completed the final closing of the sale of our ownership interest in AMAK, a Saudi Arabian closed joint stock company, which owned and operated mining assets in Saudi Arabia. Our investment was classified as discontinued operations. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Specialty Petrochemicals Operations
SHR’s specialty petrochemicals facility is located in Silsbee, Texas approximately 30 miles north of Beaumont and 90 miles east of Houston. The base SHR facility consists of five operating units which, while interconnected, make distinct products through differing processes: (i) a Penhex Unit; (ii) a Reformer Unit; (iii) a Cyclo-pentane Unit; (iv) an Advanced Reformer unit; and (v) an Isomerization Unit. In addition to the base plant, SHR operates three proprietary chemical production facilities for toll processing customers. The Penhex Unit currently has the permitted capacity to process approximately 11,000 barrels per day of fresh feed. The Reformer Unit, the Advanced Reformer unit, and the Cyclo-Pentane Unit further process streams produced by the Penhex Unit. 
The facility generally consists of equipment commonly found in most petrochemical facilities such as fractionation towers and hydrogen treaters, except the facility is adapted to produce specialized products that are high purity and very consistent with precise specifications that are utilized in the petrochemical industry as solvents, additives, blowing agents and cooling agents.
Our present total capacity at our Silsbee facility is 13,000 barrels per day of fresh feed; however, our air permits limit us to a maximum processing rate of 11,000 barrels per day. We also have a 4,000 barrels per day Advanced Reformer unit to increase our capability to upgrade by-products produced from the Penhex Unit and to provide security of hydrogen supply to the plant. We believe we have sufficient pentane capacity to maintain our share of market growth for the foreseeable future.
The Advanced Reformer, Reformer and Isomerization units are operated as needed to support the Penhex and Cyclo-pentane Units. Consequently, utilization rates of these units are driven by production from the Penhex Unit.
Operating utilization rates are affected by product demand, raw material composition, mechanical integrity, and unforeseen natural occurrences, such as weather events. The nature of the petrochemical process demands periodic shut-downs for decoking and other mechanical repairs.
In support of the specialty petrochemicals operation, we own approximately 100 storage tanks with total capacity approaching 294,000 barrels, and 130 acres of land at the plant site, 70 acres of which are developed. We also own a truck and railroad loading terminal consisting of storage tanks, nine rail spurs, and truck and tank car loading facilities on approximately 63 acres of which 36 acres are developed.
We obtain substantially all our feedstock from a sole supplier. The agreement is primarily a logistics arrangement whereby the supplier buys or contracts for feedstock material and utilizes their tank and pipeline connections to transport into our pipeline. We renewed our contract with this supplier in May 2020 for a period extending through the end of July 2026 with subsequent one year renewals unless canceled by either party with 180 days' notice. 
GSPL owns and operates two 8-inch diameter pipelines and five 4-inch diameter pipelines, aggregating approximately 70 miles in length connecting SHR’s facility to (1) a natural gas line, (2) SHR’s truck and rail loading terminal and (3) a major petroleum products pipeline system owned by an unaffiliated third party. All pipelines are operated within Texas Railroad Commission and DOT regulations for maintenance and integrity.
We sell our products predominantly to large domestic and international companies. Products are marketed through continued long term relationships. Our commercial team has historically prided itself on regular visits at customer facilities as well as attendance at various petrochemical conferences throughout the world. We also provide information about our products and services through our website. We utilize both formula and non-formula based pricing depending upon a customer’s requirements and competitive situations. Under formula pricing, the price charged to the customer is primarily based on a formula which includes as a component the average cost of feedstock over the prior month. With this pricing mechanism, product prices move in conjunction with feedstock prices. However, the formulas use an average feedstock price from the prior month. Current formula product sales prices trail current market feedstock prices by approximately 30 days. See additional discussion of concentration of revenue and corresponding receivables as disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Specialty Waxes Operations
TC is a leading manufacturer of specialty waxes and also provides custom processing services from its 27.5 acre plant located in Pasadena, Texas. TC provides custom manufacturing, hydrogenation, distillation, blending, forming and packaging of finished and intermediate products and wax products for coatings, hot melt adhesives and lubricants. Situated near the Houston Ship Channel, the facility allows for easy access to international shipping and direct loading to rail or truck. The location is within reach of major chemical pipelines and on-site access to a steam pipeline and dedicated hydrogen line create a platform for expansion of both wax production capacity and custom processing capabilities. We manufacture a variety of hard, high melting point, low to medium viscosity polyethylene wax products along with a wide range of other waxes and lubricants. These products are used in a variety of applications including: performance additives for hot melt adhesives; penetration and melting point modifiers for paraffin and microcrystalline waxes; lubrication and processing aides for plastics, PVC, rubber, and dry stir-in additives for inks. In oxidized forms, applications also include use in textile emulsions.
TC also provides turnkey custom manufacturing services including quality assurance, transportation and process optimization. The plant has high vacuum distillation capability for the separation of temperature sensitive materials. We have a fully equipped laboratory and pilot plant facility and a highly trained, technically proficient team of engineers and chemists suited to handle the rapid deployment of new custom processes and development of new wax products. TC’s custom manufacturing services provide a range of specialized capabilities to chemical and industrial customers including synthesis, hydrogenation, distillation, forming and propoxylation in addition to a number of other chemical processes.
Mineral Interests
We also owned a 55% ownership interest in an inactive mining corporation, PEVM. In November 2019, PEVM entered into a sales contract to sell all of their assets which include 48 patented and 5 unpatented claims totaling approximately 1,500 acres. The sale was completed on November 11, 2021 and resulted in liquidation of substantially all of PEVM's remaining assets. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay outstanding indebtedness of PEVM owed to the Company. PEVM was legally dissolved on February 16, 2022.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations at the national, state, and local levels. Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and to other laws regarding health and safety matters (the “Environmental and Health Laws”), many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Certain Environmental and Health Laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. 
There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws. While we continue to retain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our operations and adequate to cover foreseeable liabilities, our insurance may not cover all risks and costs of each and every environmental claim made against us, depending on particular circumstances. The Environmental and Health Laws and enforcement policies thereunder have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties, or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials or other pollutants at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products. Historically, our subsidiaries have incurred significant expenditures in order to comply with the Environmental and Health Laws and are reasonably expected to do so in the future. Those costs could increase if requirements under these Environmental and Health Laws, or agency policies and/or guidance, change. Should we discontinue the operations of a facility, we will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our chemical facilities. Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 2 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regarding open regulatory matters, in 1993, during remediation of a small spill area, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) required SHR to drill a well to check for groundwater contamination under the spill area. Two pools of hydrocarbons were discovered to be floating on the groundwater at a depth of approximately 25 feet. One pool is under the site of a former gas processing plant owned and operated by Sinclair, Arco as well as others before its purchase by SHR in 1981. Analysis of the material indicates it entered the ground prior to SHR’s acquisition of the property. The other pool is under the original SHR facility and analysis indicates the material was deposited decades ago. Tests conducted have determined that the hydrocarbons are contained on the property and not migrating in any direction. The recovery is proceeding as planned and is expected to continue for many years until the pools are reduced to acceptable levels. Expenses of recovery and periodic migration testing are being recorded as normal operating expenses. Expenses for future recovery are expected to stabilize and be less per annum than the initial set up cost, although there is no assurance of this. The light hydrocarbon recovered from the former gas plant site is compatible with our normal Penhex feedstock and is accumulated and transferred into the Penhex feedstock tank. The material recovered from under the original SHR site is accumulated and sold as a by-product. We have drilled additional wells periodically to further delineate the boundaries of the pools and to ensure that migration has not taken place. These tests confirmed that no migration of the hydrocarbon pools has occurred. The TCEQ has deemed the current action plan acceptable and reviews the plan on a semi-annual basis.

Management Actions with regard to COVID-19
We took early action regarding employee well-being in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing comprehensive protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors. Many of our employees were transitioned to a remote work environment in the early stages of the pandemic and are transitioning back to a flexible work environment. We had no reductions in scheduled hours or reductions in force for any of our employees. We also enhanced our benefits programs to offer expanded supplemental paid leave during quarantine periods and waived employee cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing.
Competition
The specialty petrochemicals and specialty waxes industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the needs of both industrial and individual consumers. We compete with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services and employ all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes. See further discussion in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
