Item 1. Business.
Overview

We were incorporated in Delaware on July 2, 2018, to engage in the business of re-selling new and used tennis and golf equipment. We have since added used golf carts to our resale inventory and have begun engaging in consignment sales of tennis rackets. The concept is to source top-quality, in-demand equipment, and resell it to both domestic and international customers. Our Company has identified popular brands and models that retain value, in new and used condition, across the various markets in which we plan to sell.

We operate as an on-line only entity and utilize eBay Inc. (“eBay”) as our primary marketing channel. We will also optimize our own website for ‘global’ search terms and internally vend equipment through an expanding referral network of repeat customers.

On January 15, 2019, we issued 3,100,000 shares of common stock to 14 individuals pursuant to the provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

On June 19, 2020, we issued 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for $20,000 to 7 individuals pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement declared effective on September 30, 2019.

On September 6, 2020, pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement declared effective on September 30, 2019, the Company issued 275,000 shares of Common Stock to unaffiliated 10 individuals, for total proceeds of $5,500.

Our principal executive office is located at 2149 Rio De Janeiro Ave., Punta Gorda, FL 33983, and our telephone number is (877) 571-5562. Our corporate website is www.pacificsportsexchange.com.

We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceeding. We do not have any subsidiaries.

Description of Business

We specialize in the reselling of new and used tennis and golf equipment, including reselling used golf carts and engaging in consignment sales of tennis rackets. The concept is to source top-quality, in-demand equipment and resell it to both domestic and international customers. We have identified popular brands and models that retain their value in new and used condition.

To source in-demand equipment, our Company has established relationships with local Southwest Florida sports retailers to purchase their surplus end-of-season inventory and trade-ins. The Company also attends golf and tennis trade shows and monitors re-seller equipment events to pin-point trends in high-demand used equipment. Both Florida and California have been identified as premium geographic locations to search for and secure the desired supply of top-end equipment.

We currently operate as an on-line only entity and utilize eBay as our primary marketing channel. We will also optimize our own website for ‘global’ search terms and internally vend equipment to a worldwide market. Because the Company relies on third-party websites such as eBay to make its sales, such reliance on any third-party platform to generate revenues carries with it certain risks including but not necessarily limited to: the Company could violate the terms of service and lose its selling privileges, or the sites themselves could experience technical issues and/or fail. The Company will always strive to abide by the policies of any third-party platform and will endeavor to provide superior customer service. The Company will also look to improve the marketing and functionality of its own website, to act as a hedge against the risk of relying on third-party partners.

The principals of our Company have experience in both the sports of tennis and golf, and through this experience have identified high-value, high-margin equipment that resells profitably to both international and domestic customers. The goal is to create a unique supply chain that targets niche, valued products and their buyers. Serious golfers and tennis players are very particular about their equipment and will go to considerable lengths to secure what they are looking for in a quest to improve their game; this customer is our prime target market and our marketing approach will be to create a relationship (wherever possible) with this customer and become their ongoing equipment supplier through social media and electronic outreach.

COVID-19

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic based on the rapid increase in global exposure. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the world and as a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served.

The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on business operations and financial results of the Company, including the timing and ability of the Company to collect accounts receivable and procure materials and supplies.

As an online-only reseller of new and used sports equipment we do not have employees or a physical retail location where customers shop. Those factors mitigate against the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations. All sports equipment inventory we hold is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized upon our receipt thereof and will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized again immediately prior to shipping such equipment to any buyer. For any equipment sold through us, but not held as inventory by us, we request the originating source of such equipment to thoroughly clean and sanitize all equipment prior to shipping the equipment to a buyer, and we also caution all buyers (whether buying inventory directly from us, or equipment from third-parties through us) to thoroughly clean and sanitize all equipment upon receipt of the same.

Although being an online only reseller of sports equipment with no physical “brick and mortar” retail site mitigates against the effects of COVID-19 on our operations, the previous and any current or future government issued “stay at home” orders, and the previous and any current or future closure, or limitations on the use, of gyms, athletic clubs, golf courses and other recreational facilities has had and will continue to have negative impacts our operations and ability to generate revenues from operations. The result of such orders and closures is that fewer people, both in the U.S. and around the World, are able (and/or willing) to engage in physical activities, and recreation, whether indoors or outdoors. While governmental restrictions continue to be lifted and more and more people are able to return to recreational activities, the potential still exists for future restrictions and closures due to different strains, or variants, of COVID-19, and the potential for the spread, and or resurgence, of the virus. Fewer people engaging in physical activities, and recreation, likely will mean fewer people in the market to purchase new and/or used sporting equipment which will have a materially negative affect on our ability to generate revenues from operations.

If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from operations to grow our business, or even sustain operations, we will be forced to rely on raising capital through debt and/or equity financing. There are no guarantees we will be able to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity.

Distribution Methods

Potential customers can find our equipment promoted through websites such as eBay and eventually through our own pacificsportsexchange.com website. eBay makes it relatively easy to ship goods to international destinations, and eBay also services the domestic US. market. Through eBay, our Company can ship tennis racquets anywhere within the continental U.S.A. for an average flat rate of $8 per item. In addition to utilizing third-party websites such as eBay, our Company is developing a robust website of our own and will undertake a key-word optimization effort to globally rank the site for tennis and golf related keywords. While eBay allows for start-up companies such as ours to instantly reach a global audience, our longer-term strategy is to have customers interact and purchase equipment directly from our website. Not only will this help with the margin-per-transaction, but also gives us an opportunity to create a long-term relationship and database with each customer. However, it must be cautioned that as website optimization occurs, especially on a global scale, this will take time and resources to accomplish, and initially eBay is our key marketing channel.

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Position in the Industry

Our Company competes with other vendors of golf and tennis equipment. We compete with a wide assortment of vendors from small local golf and tennis shops, to larger established vendors such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Amazon. There is also an assortment of successful on-line vendors such as Tennis Warehouse, Midwest Sports, Holabird Sports, and Puetz Golf, among others. At first glance the retail industry appears challenging, especially factoring in direct sales from the equipment manufacturers themselves; however, a competitive advantage lies in the specialized nature of both our target customer and our targeted products. While we sell to local domestic customers, our primary target market is foreign buyers from Asia and Europe that have a penchant for specific brands and product models not available in their local markets. We have identified select new and classic equipment that is in high demand to foreign buyers, and we have identified a reliable method to source the desired equipment. Our source of in-demand equipment comes from a network of local tennis and golf shops. Located throughout Southwest Florida, these local shops and their owners are embedded within their communities and have great relationships with the local playing public; season in and season out they receive a steady supply of trade-in equipment. Our Company has found that these vendors are happy to sell this old equipment to us at a discount. Hence, our niche strategy within the larger mass market is to service the specialized and under-served international demand with a supply of equipment sourced from a network of local Florida sport shops. Our Company believes this sourcing strategy can be duplicated on the East Coast of Florida and in other warm weather states such as California and Arizona.
Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers

The key to our success is in the quality of our leadership, and their ability to share industry knowledge and secure a reliable supply chain. Our Company is headed by Timothy Conte, a retired educator and life-long tennis and golf enthusiast. Mr. Conte is passionate about each sport and carries a Florida United States Tennis Association (USTA) tennis ranking, as well as a 9.2 United States Golf Association (USGA) golf handicap. At both a professional and volunteer level, Mr. Conte has made key Florida vendor/industry contacts and is thoroughly versed on the latest equipment technology. He is also aware and appreciative of classic tennis and golf equipment that stands the test of time and is still widely sought-after today. Mr. Conte is well traveled and has played both tennis and golf in Europe and in Asia. Mr. Conte is currently devoting 20 hours per week to our Company.

Our Company also benefits from the services of Jennifer Whitesides. Mrs. Whitesides is also a golf and tennis enthusiast and is involved in Florida USTA tennis instruction and carries a USGA golf handicap. Mrs. Whitesides’ main responsibility is to secure a reliable supply chain. Golf and tennis shops, trade shows, and reseller events of South Florida will be the initial source of equipment, followed by a structured buying campaign in California. Mrs. Whitesides works side-by-side with Mr. Conte, leverage her existing industry contacts and ensure that the supply of equipment meets any pending demand. Mrs. Whitesides is working a total of 8 hours per week for our Company.

Both officers also monitor eBay for underpriced listings of tennis and golf equipment. These listings do appear from time to time and offer upside resell opportunity.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


We can take advantage of these provisions through November 30, 2023. If certain events occur prior to November 30, 2023, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to November 30, 2023.

We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. 

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.
