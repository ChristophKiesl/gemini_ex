ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information

GSG Group Inc. (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) has been incorporated as Wike Corp. in the State of Nevada on November 11, 2014. Initially we were a development-stage company in the ornamental ribbons printing business. On April 6, 2017, we changed the business to consulting services for investors into the Asian real estate market and other growth industries. On September 15, 2017, the name change to GSG Group Inc. was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and the Company began discussions to add Medical Devices production and trading to its business portfolio. Since July 24th, 2020 the Company has its office at Haagwinde 20, 5262 KZ Vught, The Netherlands.

On August 28, 2019 Company entered into an Asset Assignment Agreement (as amended on July 12, 2020 and extended on December 28, 2021) with Prejex Holding GmbH in Germany, under which it acquires certain brand rights (brand registration and the Prejex website, currently held in trust for Company by related party Medical Consult Europe B.V.) and the right to use certain competences regarding production of needle free injection devices. In return it promises to invest the total amount of US$ 1,000,000.00 within 24 months from the date of the Agreement into producing such needle free injection devices and making Prejex Holding GmbH the exclusive production manager worldwide with a remuneration to Prejex Holding GmbH of 5% of all worldwide turnover as relates to the assigned Business Assets as defined by the Agreement. Under the amendment dated July 12, 2020, Company agreed to induce its shareholder Mr. Xin Chen to cancel 19,000,000 of his shares against payment of US$ 150,000.00 by Prejex Holding GmbH to Mr. Chen no later than June 30, 2021. While Mr. Chen had his shares cancelled on November 06, 2020, the parties extended the deadline for Prejex´ payment by mutual consent to June 30, 2022. 

On July 13, 2020, the shareholders of the Company in a majority vote appointed Mr. Frank Raymakers as new director, President and CEO, Mr. Maarten Stuut as new director and CFO, Mr. Alfred Kelly as director and Chief Operating Officers and Mr. Eric P. Ditkowsky as new director and Chief Sales Officer. Mr. Gim Hooi OOI was appointed as the new Chief Marketing Officer.

On April 14, 2021, our CFO Mr. Maarten Stuut was appointed also as CEO due to the sudden passing of Mr. Raymakers on April 11, 2021. 

On December 28, 2021, all deadlines stipulated in the Asset Assignment Agreement have been extended until December 31, 2023, where necessary, by the “Extension of Asset Assignment Agreement” concluded between the parties on that date. The extension had become necessary due to the impact of Covid restrictions on the ability of the parties to execute their business plan within the timelines estimated before.

Products
Originally, we specialized mostly on ribbons printing. Since 2017 until late 2018 we stopped the printing business and focused on advising investors on the Asia real estate market, specifically in Cambodia. This is also how we decided in Q2/2019 to enter into discussions about production of medical devices in Cambodia. 

On August 28, 2019 and July 12, 2020 we signed the Asset Assignment Agreement which stipulates the acquisition of certain brand and production rights from Prejex Holding GmbH in Germany, which allow us the production and distribution of certain needle free injection devices globally. 

At the time of this document the Company is working with its partners in Germany on an updated version of its needle free injector device. With production capacities on standby, management has also begun the process of preparing update filings for re-admission with the FDA in the USA and, at the same time are in discussions with potential OEM partners for the product´s market roll-out in the Middle and Near East. The Company is determined to start building cash flows in the medical devices area as quickly as possible.

Market Overview
Other than applying our network in Cambodia in real estate and private infrastructure to identify potential production sites, our most recent inclusion of the medical devices space with the needle free injection technology has led us to put more focus on a US market roll-out for the ready produced devices. 

According to Datamonitor Healthcare, 35% of global prescription sales for the top 50 pharmaceutical companies were attributed to injectable drugs, with sales growing at 43% from 2010 to 2018. The combination of the growing importance of injectable drugs, to the phobia caused by needles, the increase in self-administered or “at home” injections, and the rising cost associated with needle stick injuries, provides the dynamics for the accelerated growth of the needle-free or injection technology marketplace.

The global needle-free drug delivery devices market was valued at USD 10.9 billion by 2019, following a 2012-2019 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6%. 

In 2019, insulin delivery for diabetes was observed to be the leading application segment accounting for 31.0% of the total market already then. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total number of people diagnosed with diabetes was 177 million in 2000 and is expected to reach 300 million by 2025. Thus, the rise in prevalence of diabetes and increasing non-communicable diseases has been and is expected to continue to boost the growth of the needle-free drug delivery devices market globally. 

North America was observed to be the largest market for needle-free drug delivery devices and accounted for 43.1% of the total market in 2019. The market is mainly driven by high public awareness about novel drug delivery systems, government initiatives for the introduction of needle free drug delivery devices in community vaccination programs and key players domiciled in this region. Asia Pacific was observed to be one of the fastest growing markets with the highest CAGR of 16.3% during the period from 2013 to 2019. The factors attributed to the growth of the market are opportunities available with a wide range of undiscovered applications and untapped countries with high potential in this geography.
