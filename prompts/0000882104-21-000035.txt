ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
Overview
In this report all references to “PDL,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean collectively PDL BioPharma, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the term means only PDL BioPharma, Inc.
Throughout our history, our mission has been to improve the lives of patients by aiding in the successful development of innovative therapeutics and healthcare technologies. PDL BioPharma was founded in 1986 as Protein Design Labs, Inc. when it pioneered the humanization of monoclonal antibodies, enabling the discovery of a new generation of targeted treatments that have had a profound impact on patients living with different cancers as well as a variety of other debilitating diseases. In 2006, we changed our name to PDL BioPharma, Inc.
Historically, we generated a substantial portion of our revenues through the license agreements related to patents covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as the Queen et al. patents. In 2012, and in anticipation of declining revenues from the Queen et al. patents, we began providing alternative sources of capital through royalty monetizations and debt facilities, and, in 2016, we began acquiring commercial-stage products and launching specialized companies dedicated to the commercialization of these products, first with our acquisition of branded prescription pharmaceutical drugs from Novartis AG, Novartis Pharma AG and Speedel Holding AG (collectively, “Novartis”) in 2016 and, in 2017, with the acquisition of LENSAR, Inc. (“LENSAR”), a medical device ophthalmology equipment manufacturing company. In 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (“Evofem”), pursuant to which we invested $60.0 million in a private placement of securities. These investments provided funding for Evofem’s pre-commercial activities for Phexxi®, its non-hormonal, on-demand prescription contraceptive gel for women.
Our Segments
Based on the nature of our investments entered into between 2012 through 2019 and further discussed below, our operations were structured in four segments designated as Medical Devices, Strategic Positions, Income Generating Assets, and Pharmaceutical.
Our Medical Devices segment consisted of revenue from the sale and lease of the LENSAR® Laser System, which included equipment, Patient Interface Devices (“PIDs”), procedure licenses, training, installation, warranty and maintenance agreements.
Our Strategic Positions segment consisted of an investment in Evofem (NASDAQ: EVFM). Our investment included shares of common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock.
Our Pharmaceutical segment consisted of revenue derived from branded prescription medicine products sold under the name Tekturna® and Tekturna HCT® in the United States, Rasilez® and Rasilez HCT® in the rest of the world and revenue generated from the sale of an authorized generic form of Tekturna in the United States (collectively, the “Noden Products”).
Our Income Generating Assets segment consisted of revenue derived from (i) notes and other long-term receivables, (ii) royalty rights and hybrid notes/royalty receivables, (iii) equity investments and (iv) royalties from issued patents in the United States and elsewhere covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as the Queen et al. patents.
Financial information about our segments, including our revenues and net loss for the eight months ended August 31, 2020 and the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and select long-lived assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in this Form 10-K.
Liquidation and Dissolution Plan
In September 2019, we engaged financial and legal advisors and initiated a review of our strategy. This review was completed in December 2019. At such time, we disclosed that we planned to halt the execution of our growth strategy, cease making additional strategic transactions and investments and instead pursue a formal process to unlock the value of our portfolio by monetizing our assets and ultimately distributing net proceeds to stockholders (the “monetization strategy”). We further announced in December 2019 that we would explore a variety of potential transactions in connection with the monetization strategy, including a whole Company sale, divestiture of our assets, spin-offs of operating entities, merger opportunities or a combination thereof. Over the subsequent months, our board of directors (the “Board”) and management analyzed, together with our outside financial and legal advisors, how to best capture value pursuant to our monetization strategy and best return the significant intrinsic value of the assets in our portfolio to the stockholders.
In February 2020, the Board approved a plan of complete liquidation (the “Plan of Liquidation”) of our assets and passed a resolution to seek stockholder approval to dissolve our Company. At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders in August 2020, the proposal to liquidate and dissolve our Company pursuant to a plan of dissolution was approved by our stockholders. On November 5, 2020, our Board approved filing a certificate of dissolution with the Secretary of State of Delaware in January 2021 and proceeding to complete the dissolution process for our Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporate Law. The filing of the certificate of dissolution occurred on January 4, 2021 and we closed our stock transfer books as of such date (the “Final Record Date”). After such time, we are not recording any further transfers of our common stock, except pursuant to the provisions of a deceased stockholder’s will, intestate succession, or by operation of law and we will not issue any new stock certificates, other than replacement certificates. In addition, we will not be issuing any shares of our common stock for the outstanding stock options. As a result of the closing of our transfer books, it is anticipated that distributions, if any, made in connection with the dissolution will be made pro rata to the stockholders of record as of the Final Record Date. In accordance with our dissolution plan, we completed the voluntary delisting process from the Nasdaq Stock Market exchange so that suspension of trading occurred before the market opened on December 31, 2020 and official delisting of our stock occurred on January 7, 2021. On January 8, 2021, we filed a Form 15 notifying the SEC of deregistration of our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspension of our duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. We do not anticipate participating in Over-The-Counter (“OTC”) trading related to our stock or economic interests in our stock.
Pursuant to our monetization strategy, we explored a variety of potential transactions, including a whole Company sale, divestiture of assets, spin-offs of operating entities, merger opportunities or a combination thereof. In addition, we analyzed, and continue to analyze, optimal mechanisms for returning value to stockholders in a tax-efficient manner, including share repurchases, cash dividends and other distributions of assets. Despite the challenges of the 2019 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), we made significant progress in our monetization strategy during 2020, including monetizing most of our key assets and resolving a longstanding legal issue as follows:
•In May 2020, pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation we made a liquidation distribution of all of our common stock in Evofem to PDL stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2020 (the “Evofem Record Date”). 
•In August 2020, we entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with related entities of Defined Diagnostics, LLC (f/k/a Wellstat Diagnostics, LLC) (“Wellstat Diagnostics” and, together with such related entities, the “Wellstat Parties”) resolving previously reported litigation relating to loans made to Wellstat Diagnostics by us
•In August 2020, we sold three royalty interests related to third party sales of Kybella®, Zalviso®, and Coflex® to SWK Funding, LLC (“SWK”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SWK Holdings Corporation
•In September 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our interest in Noden DAC and Noden USA
•In October 2020, pursuant to our Plan of Liquidation we completed the previously announced spin-off of LENSAR, our majority-owned medical device company, whereby we made a liquidation distribution of all of our shares of LENSAR common stock to our stockholders as of September 22, 2020 (the “LENSAR Record Date”)
•In December 2020, we entered into a Capital Provision Agreement with Epps Investments LLC (“Epps”) regarding our previously announced Settlement Agreement with the Wellstat Parties whereby we sold all remaining amounts owed to us under the Settlement Agreement for consideration received
The Settlement Agreement with the Wellstat Parties provided for the payment of $7.5 million upon the signing of the Settlement Agreement, which has been received, and either (1) $5.0 million by February 10, 2021 and $55.0 million by July 26, 2021; or (2) $67.5 million by July 26, 2021. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, failure by the Wellstat Parties to make payment in full by July 26, 2021, authorized us to record judgment against the Wellstat Parties for an amount of $92.5 million or such lesser amount as may be owed under the Settlement Agreement.
Pursuant to the Capital Provision Agreement with Epps we received $51.4 million on December 31, 2020 in exchange for 100% of the payments or other property or value received by PDL on or after the date of the Capital Provision Agreement pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.
The proceeds from the sale of the three royalty interests to SWK totaled $4.35 million, 90% of which was received at the closing of the transaction. The remaining 10% is currently held in escrow against certain potential contingencies and is to be released on the one-year anniversary of the closing, subject to the satisfaction of any such potential contingencies.
On July 30, 2020, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of our interest in Noden DAC and Noden USA to CAT Capital Bidco Limited (“Stanley Capital”). In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we expect to receive consideration of up to $52.8 million. Stanley Capital made an initial cash payment to us of $12.2 million on the September 9, 2020 closing date. We are also entitled to recover $0.5 million related to value-added tax (“VAT”) for inventory purchases from Novartis. The agreement provides for an additional $33.0 million to be paid to us in twelve equal quarterly installments from January 2021 to October 2023, of which the first installment payment has been received. An additional $3.9 million will be paid in four equal quarterly installments from January 2023 to October 2023. The agreement also provides for the potential for additional contingent payments to us. We are entitled to receive $2.5 million upon Stanley Capital or any of its affiliates entering into a binding agreement for a specified transaction within one year of the closing date. We are also entitled to 50% of a license fee from a third party distributor within 10 days of receipt by Noden. Upon closing, we recorded a gain of $0.2 million. In connection with the closing of the transaction, the guaranty agreement between Novartis and us which guaranteed certain payments owed to Novartis by Noden was terminated.
We intend to pursue monetization of our remaining assets in a disciplined and cost-effective manner to maximize returns to stockholders. At the same time, we recognize that accelerating the timeline to complete our monetization process, while continuing to optimize asset value, could increase returns to stockholders due to reduced general and administrative expenses as well as provide for faster returns to stockholders. While we are cognizant that an accelerated timeline may provide greater and faster returns to our stockholders, we also recognize that the duration and extent of the public health issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic make it possible that the timing of the sale of all or substantially all of our remaining assets may require additional time to execute or for us to pursue alternatives to the sale of these assets. For example, if a suitable offer to purchase the remaining royalty assets is not received prior to completing the dissolution process, they could be placed in a liquidating trust. The available proceeds from either the ongoing collection of royalty income or from the sale of the royalty assets would ultimately be distributed to our stockholders. We will continue to assess the market for our remaining assets to determine the appropriate time to sell them or to opt for alternative paths to return their value to our stockholders.
Following is a discussion of our current and historical segments. 
Medical Devices
LENSAR
LENSAR is a commercial-stage medical device company focused on designing, developing and marketing an advanced femtosecond laser system for the treatment of cataracts and the management of pre-existing or surgically induced corneal astigmatism. LENSAR’s femtosecond laser uses proprietary advanced imaging and laser technology to customize planning and treatments, allowing faster visual recovery and improved outcomes, as compared to conventional cataract surgery, a more manual procedure combined with ultrasound, referred to as phacoemulsification. LENSAR has developed the LENSAR® Laser System, which is the only femtosecond cataract laser built specifically for refractive cataract surgery. At spin-off, LENSAR had over 95 granted patents in the United States and the rest of the world and over 55 pending patent applications in the United States and the rest of the world.
As noted above, on October 1, 2020 all outstanding shares of LENSAR common stock held by us were distributed to our holders of common stock as of the LENSAR Record Date. On October 1, each of our stockholders received 0.075879 shares of LENSAR common stock for every one share of our common stock held by such holders, based on the number of outstanding shares on the LENSAR Record Date. LENSAR continues to own and operate its femtosecond laser system business following completion of the distribution. As of October 1, 2020 LENSAR became an independent, publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “LNSR”.
Strategic Positions
Evofem
We invested $60.0 million in Evofem in the second quarter of 2019, representing approximately a 27% ownership interest in the company as of March 31, 2020. The transaction was structured in two tranches. The first tranche comprised $30.0 million, which was funded on April 11, 2019. We invested an additional $30.0 million in a second tranche on June 10, 2019, alongside two existing Evofem stockholders, who each invested an additional $10.0 million. On May 21, 2020 we distributed all of our 13,333,334 shares of common stock of Evofem to our stockholders of record on the Evofem Record Date, which represented approximately 26.7% of the outstanding shares of Evofem common stock as of the close of business on May 15, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we continued to hold the warrants to purchase up to 3,333,334 shares of Evofem common stock.
Evofem is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative products to address unmet needs in women’s sexual and reproductive health. Evofem is leveraging its proprietary Multipurpose Vaginal pH Regulator (MVP-R™) platform for its first commercial product Phexxi® (L-lactic acid, citric acid and potassium bitartrate) for hormone-free birth control. On May 22, 2020 Phexxi® was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of pregnancy in women who choose to use on demand methods for their contraceptive needs. On September 8, 2020, Phexxi® was commercially launched in the United States.
As of June 30, 2020, the Strategic Positions segment was classified as discontinued operations.
Pharmaceutical
Noden
On July 1, 2016, our subsidiary, Noden DAC, entered into an asset purchase agreement (“Noden Purchase Agreement”) whereby it purchased from Novartis the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, market, and sell the Noden Products and certain related assets and assumed certain related liabilities (the “Noden Transaction”). Noden DAC and Noden USA, together, and including their respective subsidiaries represented deployed capital of $191.2 million.
Tekturna (or Rasilez outside of the United States) contains aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, for the treatment of hypertension. While indicated as a first line treatment, it is more commonly used as a third line treatment in those patients who are intolerant of angiotensin-receptor blockers (“ARBs”) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (“ACEIs”). Studies indicate that approximately 12% of hypertension patients are ARB/ACEI intolerant. Tekturna and Rasilez are not indicated for use with ARBs and ACEIs in patients with diabetes or renal impairment and are contraindicated for use by pregnant women. In March 2019, we launched an authorized generic (“AG”) form of Tekturna, aliskiren hemifumarate 150 mg and 300 mg tablets in the United States with the same drug formulation as Tekturna. The AG is distributed by Prasco, LLC d/b/a Prasco Laboratories.
Tekturna HCT is a combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, for the treatment of hypertension in patients not adequately controlled by monotherapy and as an initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. It is not indicated for use with ACEIs and ARBs in patient with diabetes or renal impairment, or for use in patients with known anuria or hypersensitivity to sulfonamide derived drugs and is contraindicated for use by pregnant women.
On September 9, 2020, we sold 100% of our interests in our wholly owned subsidiaries Noden DAC and Noden USA to Stanley Capital.
As of March 31, 2020, the Pharmaceutical segment was classified as discontinued operations.
Income Generating Assets
The income generating assets included in continuing operations consist of (i) notes and other long-term receivables, (ii) equity investments and (iii) royalties from the Queen et. al patents.
Notes and Other Long-Term Receivables
We have entered into credit agreements with borrowers across the healthcare industry, under which we made available cash loans to be used by the borrower. Obligations under these credit agreements are typically secured by a pledge of substantially all the assets of the borrower and any of its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, we had one note receivable transaction outstanding, CareView, which is summarized below:
CareView
Technology
CareView is a provider of products and on-demand application services for the healthcare industry by specializing in bedside video monitoring, archiving and patient care documentation systems and patient entertainment services.
Deal Summary
In June 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with CareView, whereby we made available to CareView up to $40.0 million in loans comprised of two tranches of $20.0 million each, subject to CareView’s attainment of specified milestones and under which we have a security interest in substantially all of CareView’s assets. In October 2015, we and CareView entered into an amendment of the credit agreement to modify certain definitions related to the first and second tranche milestones and we funded the first tranche of $20.0 million, net of fees, based on CareView’s attainment of the first milestone, as amended. The second $20.0 million tranche was not funded due to CareView’s failure to meet the funding milestone and we have no further funding obligation at this time. The outstanding borrowing under the credit agreement initially bore interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum payable quarterly in arrears. Principal repayment was to commence on the ninth quarterly interest payment date and continue in equal installments until final maturity of the loan in October 2020. 
In February 2018, we entered into a modification agreement with CareView (the “February 2018 Modification Agreement”) whereby we agreed, effective as of December 28, 2017, to modify the credit agreement before remedies could otherwise have become available to us under the credit agreement in relation to certain obligations of CareView that would potentially not be met, including the requirement to make principal payments. Under the February 2018 Modification Agreement, we agreed that (i) a lower liquidity covenant would be applicable and (ii) principal repayment would be delayed for a period of up to December 31, 2018. In exchange for agreeing to these modifications, among other things, the exercise price of our warrants to purchase 4.4 million shares of common stock of CareView was reduced and, subject to the occurrence of certain events, CareView agreed to grant us additional equity interests. In each of September 2018, December 2018, May 2019, September 2019 and December 2019, we entered into amendments to the February 2018 Modification Agreement with CareView whereby we agreed to deferrals of principal repayments and interest payments. In the May 2019 amendment we also increased the interest rate to 15.5% and removed the liquidity covenant under the credit agreement. In January 2020 we agreed to a further amendment of the February 2018 Modification Agreement that deferred principal repayment and interest payments until April 30, 2020, which was conditioned upon CareView raising additional financing from third parties. Pursuant to further amendments to the February 2018 Modification Agreement, the Company has agreed to defer principal and interest payments until May 31, 2021. 
Royalties from Queen et al. patents
We have been issued patents in the United States and elsewhere, covering the humanization of antibodies, which we refer to as our Queen et al. patents. Our Queen et al. patents, for which final patent expiry was in December 2014, covered, among other things, humanized antibodies, methods for humanizing antibodies, polynucleotide encoding in humanized antibodies and methods of producing humanized antibodies.
We previously entered into licensing agreements under our Queen et al. patents with numerous entities that are independently developing or have developed humanized antibodies. Under our licensing agreements, we are entitled to receive a flat-rate royalty based upon our licensees’ net sales of covered antibodies, although the royalties under these agreements have substantially ended.
Solanezumab is a Lilly-licensed humanized monoclonal antibody being tested in a study of older individuals who may be at risk of memory loss and cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly has characterized the study as an assessment of whether an anti-amyloid investigational drug in older individuals who do not yet show symptoms of Alzheimer's disease cognitive impairment or dementia can slow memory loss and cognitive decline. The study will also test whether solanezumab treatment can delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease related brain injury on imaging and other biomarkers. If solanezumab is approved and commercialized pursuant to this clinical trial or another, we would be entitled to receive a royalty based on a "know-how" license for technology provided in the design of this antibody. The 2% royalty on net sales is payable for 12.5 years after the product's first commercial sale. The above described study is currently in Phase 3 testing with an estimated study completion date expected in January of 2023.
Competition
The underlying products associated with our income generating assets compete with existing products and are vulnerable to new branded or generic entrants in the marketplace.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 11 full-time employees managing our intellectual property, operations and other corporate activities, as well as performing certain essential functions of a public company. All of our employees were based in the United States. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. As a result of the dissolution process, our human capital resources objectives include, retaining, and incentivizing our management team and other employees as we continue our monetization strategy. For example, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted a Wind Down Retention Plan in which our executive officers and other employees were eligible to participate. Under the Wind Down Retention Plan, participants have been eligible to earn a retention benefit in consideration for their continued employment with us as we continue our monetization strategy and dissolution process.
