Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Trulieve is a multi-state cannabis operator which currently operates under licenses in six states. Headquartered in Quincy, Florida, we are the market leader for quality medical cannabis products and services in Florida and aim to be the brand of choice for medical and adult-use customers in all of the markets that we serve. We operate in highly regulated markets that require expertise in cultivation, manufacturing, retail and logistics. We have developed proficiencies in each of these functions and are committed to utilizing predictive analytics to stay abreast of market trends, consumer demographics and evolving demand. 
 All of the states in which we operate have adopted legislation to permit the use of cannabis products for medicinal purposes to treat specific conditions and diseases, which we refer to as medical cannabis. Recreational marijuana, or adult-use cannabis, is legal marijuana sold in licensed dispensaries to adults ages 21 and older. Thus far, of the states in which we operate, only California and Massachusetts have adopted legislation permitting the commercialization of adult-use cannabis products. As of December 31, 2020, we employed nearly 5,000 people and we are committed to providing patients and adult consumers, which we refer to herein as “patients” or “customers,” a consistent and welcoming retail experience across Trulieve branded stores. We have eight material subsidiaries: Trulieve, Inc., or Trulieve US, Leef Industries, LLC, or Leef Industries, Life Essence, Inc., or Life Essence, Trulieve Holdings, Inc., or Trulieve Holdings, Trulieve Bristol, Inc. (formerly The Healing Corner, Inc. and referred to herein as “Healing Corner”), PurePenn LLC, Keystone Relief Centers, LLC (which we refer to as “Solevo Wellness”), and Trulieve WV, Inc., or Trulieve WV. Each of Trulieve US, Leef Industries, Life Essence, Trulieve Holdings Healing Corner, PurePenn LLC and Solevo Wellness and Trulieve WV is wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) by Trulieve Cannabis Corp. As of December 31, 2020, substantially all of our revenue was generated from the sale of cannabis products for medicinal use in the State of Florida. To date, neither the sale of adult-use cannabis products, nor our operations in Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania or West Virginia, have been material to our business.
 In states that require cannabis companies to be vertically integrated, ownership of the entire supply chain mitigates third-party risks and allows us to completely control product quality and brand experience. We believe that this results in high patient retention and brand loyalty. We successfully operate our core business functions of cultivation, production and distribution at scale, and are skilled at rapidly increasing capacity without any interruption to existing operations. The Trulieve brand philosophy of “Patients First” permeates our culture beginning with high-quality cultivation and current good manufacturing practices or CGMP, certified product manufacturing, through the consumer experience at Trulieve stores, at our in-house call center and at patient residences through a robust home delivery program.
 Florida
 Trulieve US is a vertically integrated “seed to sale” cannabis company and is the largest licensed medical marijuana company in the State of Florida. As of December 31, 2020, publicly available reports filed with the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use show Trulieve US to have the most dispensing locations and the greatest dispensing volume across product categories out of all licensed medical marijuana businesses in the state. Trulieve US cultivates and produces all of its products in-house and distributes those products to patients in Trulieve branded stores (dispensaries) throughout the State of Florida, as well as via home delivery. Trulieve’s experience in the vertically integrated Florida market has given us the ability to scale and penetrate in all necessary business segments (cultivation, production, sales and distribution). Trulieve US has the experience necessary to increase market leadership in Florida and employ that expertise effectively in other regulated markets.
 As of December 31, 2020, Trulieve US operated over 1,900,808 square feet of cultivation facilities across five sites. In accordance with Florida law, Trulieve US grows all of its cannabis in secure enclosed indoor facilities and greenhouse structures.
 Trulieve US operates a current good manufacturing practices, or CGMP, certified processing facility, encompassing an estimated 55,000 square feet. In furtherance of our patient-first focus, we have developed a suite of Trulieve branded products with over 550 stock keeping units, or SKUs, including flower, edibles, vaporizer cartridges, concentrates, topicals, capsules, tinctures, dissolvable powders, and nasal sprays. This wide variety of products gives patients the ability to select the product that consistently delivers the desired effect and in their preferred method of delivery. These products are delivered to patients statewide in Trulieve-branded retail stores and by home delivery. As of December 31, 2020, Trulieve US operated 70 stores throughout the State of Florida. 
 Massachusetts
 Life Essence is currently in the permitting and development phase for multiple adult-use and medical cannabis retail locations, as well as a cultivation and product manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. Life Essence has been awarded a Final Adult Use Marijuana Retailer License for an adult-use dispensary in Northampton and a Final Medical Marijuana Treatment Center License for medical marijuana cultivation and processing in Holyoke and an affiliated dispensing location in Northampton. Life Essence also holds Provisional Licenses for Adult Use cultivation and processing at the same facility in Holyoke, and provisional certificates of registration for medical marijuana dispensaries in Holyoke and Cambridge. Life Essence has received clearance to admit plant stock to the Holyoke facility and has completed adult-use licensure inspections, and now expects to receive final adult-use cultivation and processing licenses. The completion of these licensing processes will allow Life Essence to capitalize on its investment in infrastructure and engage in vertically integrated operations in both adult-use and medical markets in Massachusetts.

In October 2020, Life Essence entered into an asset purchase agreement with Patient Centric of Martha’s Vineyard Ltd., or PCMV, pursuant to which Life Essence agreed to purchase certain assets of PCMV including the rights to a Provisional Marijuana Retailer License from the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, the right to exercise an option held by PCMV to lease real property in Framingham, Massachusetts for use as a marijuana retailer, and necessary municipal entitlements to operate as a marijuana retailer at the property. In December 2020, Life Essence entered into an asset purchase agreement with Nature’s Remedy of Massachusetts, Inc., or Nature’s Remedy, and Sammartino Investments, LLC pursuant to which Life Essence agreed to purchase certain assets of Nature’s Remedy including a Final Marijuana Retailer License from the Cannabis Control Commission, assignment of a long-term lease for real property in Worcester, Massachusetts for use as a marijuana retailer, and necessary municipal entitlements to operate as a marijuana retailer at the property.  We expect the closing of both transactions to occur promptly following receipt of applicable state and local regulatory approvals.
 California
 Leef Industries operates a licensed medical and adult-use cannabis dispensary located in Palm Springs, California. Trulieve believes Leef Industries has demonstrated encouraging growth in the market, offering in-store and online shopping, along with product home delivery. Leef Industries is in the process of Trulieve rebranding and alignment with corporate operational standards, which we believe will increase consumer appeal and operational efficiency. The dispensary helps us stay abreast of trends on the west coast in a robust and innovative cannabis market distinguished by local competition between diverse and numerous operators.
Connecticut
 Healing Corner is a licensed pharmacist-managed medical cannabis dispensary located in Bristol, Connecticut. Healing Corner was founded in 2014 and provides a range of medical marijuana products produced by high quality licensed suppliers. At the dispensary, a licensed pharmacist and trained staff provide on-site counseling and education to patients. Patients may reserve their medical marijuana order through Healing Corner’s innovative Canna-Fill online system. As of December 31, 2020, Healing Corner served approximately 10% of Connecticut’s medical marijuana patient population.

PurePenn operates cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facilities in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area and currently wholesales the PurePenn and Moxie brands to 100% of the operating dispensaries in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2020, PurePenn has 35,000 square feet of cultivation space. Solevo Wellness operates three medical marijuana dispensaries with approximately 16,000 square feet of retail space, each with six points of sale, in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area.

On January 29, 2021, Trulieve WV was notified that it has been awarded four dispensary permits by the West Virginia Office of Medical Cannabis.  On March 22, 2021, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Mountaineer Holding, LLC (“Mountaineer”).  Mountaineer holds a West Virginia cultivation license and two dispensary licenses.  We expected the transaction to close promptly following regulatory approval. We are actively working to begin operations as soon as reasonably practicable, which will vary by location depending on permitting and construction timelines.

Data Utilization for Predictive Analytics
 Trulieve collects and analyzes data throughout our entire seed-to-sale process for three primary reasons: regulatory compliance, diversion prevention, and business insight. All strategic and tactical business decisions are driven by analyses of historical data coupled with market inputs that allow for predictive analysis designed to ensure the best possible solution is formulated and executed. Internal data collection systems are based on a state-of-the-art SAP integration, which is cloud based and routinely backed up to ensure the security and integrity of data repositories. SAP is among the most trusted and widely used business software providers internationally and worked closely with Trulieve to provide an innovative custom integration that fulfills all of our unique business and compliance needs.
 In our cultivation activities, we use data analytics to predict future yields and plan future crop rotations to meet projected patient demand. Our predictive analysis is designed to ensure that we operate in an efficient manner to maximize the harvest output to cost ratio, while delivering products with desirable characteristics. These data are complemented by market insights including observed and predicted purchasing patterns and product trends in markets with shared characteristics.
 We also use data analytics throughout the entire manufacturing process to monitor outputs in real-time, assist with quality control, facilitate continuous process improvement, and analyze key metrics to optimize lean flow efficiency. Recording and analysis of data at critical control points allows Trulieve to identify any potential production issues early, thereby preventing production waste and losses, as well as quality and safety concerns. Consistency and safety are paramount to Trulieve and tracking recorded data provides end-to-end traceability for all products distributed as well as a consistent and safe product line that customers can rely on for relief.
 Once our products are in Trulieve stores, each sales transaction is recorded and transmitted to regulatory authorities as required under state law. Reports derived from the recorded transaction information allow us to assess – by retail location – sales trends, quantities dispensed, and products sold by subcategory, both at one point in time and over a determined time period. We use this data for regression and predictive analysis, cultivation crop and derivative product manufacturing planning, and patient marketing. The data is also key in planning future cultivation and manufacturing expansion. On the retail side, delivery request volume is used to guide new retail store placement and predictive analyses inform retail inventory planning.
 High-Yield Cultivation Facilities and Techniques
 Trulieve produces high quality cannabis flower for direct consumption and uses a variety of processes to transform this high-quality biomass into the extensive portfolio of products sold in our stores. Our prominence in our core market demonstrates the quality and affordability of the product we produce at scale. With a focus on replicable, scalable operations, we have detailed design standards, standard operating procedures, and training protocols that are employed across all cultivation sites to achieve a high level of consistency and medicinal quality.
 As of December 31, 2020, Trulieve US operated over 1,900,808 square feet of cultivation facilities across five sites in Florida. In accordance with Florida law, Trulieve US grows in secure enclosed indoor facilities and greenhouse structures. In Massachusetts, we anticipate that we will complete the first phase of our 93,000 square foot medical marijuana cultivation and processing facility in the first quarter of 2021.  In Pennsylvania, PurePenn has 35,000 square feet of cultivation space, which we expect to expand to 90,000 square feet in the first half of 2021.
 The ability to quickly construct and operate high-yield cultivation facilities at commercial scale is critical in all of the markets in which we are authorized to cultivate. We currently grow over 100 cannabis flower strains with varying price points and cannabinoid ratios. Our cultivation strategies have proven successful in our core market: as of December 31, 2020, based on publicly available reports filed with the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use, Trulieve is responsible for approximately 50% of all cannabis flower sold in Florida through licensed dispensaries.  We believe we can replicate this success in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and West Virginia and will continue to apply our successful practices in all markets in which we secure cultivation authorizations.
 

Scaled, Quality Production 
 As a vertically-integrated company in Florida, Trulieve US produces 100% of all products sold in our Florida stores. Our operations in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, will also be vertically-integrated. We have successfully obtained CGMP-certification for our Florida manufacturing facility and have constructed and plan to construct new manufacturing facilities with CGMP-certification as a goal in other markets. Detailed standard operating procedures and comprehensive quality systems are in place to ensure safe and effective products are delivered to our patients. Trulieve invests in a large number of in-house quality personnel as well as testing laboratories, both of which allow us to control quality in all aspects of our business while operating at scale. 
 We primarily utilize super critical ethanol extraction to obtain the cannabis oil used in the majority of our branded products. We also utilize carbon dioxide extraction for terpene extraction as well as a line of CO2 vaporizer cartridges. In 2021, we expect to begin using light hydrocarbon extraction will be a new addition in 2021 across multiple states, allowing for concentrates that preserve the natural ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other target compounds to better replicate the flower experience. Light hydrocarbon extraction will also offer the benefit of greater extraction yields in many cases.

Marketing and Community Outreach 
 Trulieve’s marketing strategies in medical cannabis markets currently center around education and outreach for three key groups: physicians, patients and potential patients.
 We provide industry leading education, outreach and support to all registered Florida medical cannabis physicians. Our educational materials are designed to help physicians understand cannabinoid science, the high standards pursuant to which our plants are cultivated, the processes required for regulatory compliance, and how our products provide relief for patients. Our dedicated physician education team delivers in-person outreach to hundreds of physicians each month as well as immediate phone support through a dedicated physician education team member in our call center. We attribute much of our success to the work we have done with physicians and are actively replicating this structure in the markets we are expanding into.
 Patients primarily learn about us through their physicians, patient-centric community events, and digital marketing. We participate in dozens of patient outreach and community events on a monthly basis. An engaged patient audience is captured through our digital content marketing and via multiple popular social media platforms.
 We also attend many events focused on educating non-patients who may benefit such as veterans, seniors, organizations that serve qualifying patient populations, and various health and wellness groups. Search engine optimization of our website also captures potential patients researching the benefits of medical marijuana, which offers another pathway to informative materials about therapeutic uses of cannabis, our products and how to legally access them.
 Patient Focused Experiences
 It is our goal to generate brand loyalty by providing customers with industry-leading products and superior service in an appealing, approachable setting. We accomplish this goal through several key strategies: training; branded store experiences; brand awareness; multiple channels of distribution; our loyalty program and communication platforms; and research and development.
Training
 Patient experience is an area of significant focus for Trulieve. We employ and continuously improve numerous training programs and methods in an effort to provide our front-line workers with the resources and information they need to provide patients with an excellent experience across all Trulieve branded locations. In addition, we utilize an advanced learning management system in cultivation and processing to standardize and track training. A multi-level training structure that employs three different training methodologies is used to track employee performance against our internal standards. This training approach is dynamic and subject to regular evaluation under our continuous improvement program. We offer specialized management training so there is daily reinforcement of patient experience best practices.
Branded Store Experiences
 We maintain a consistent look and feel across our dispensary locations to streamline the dispensary experience for the benefit of patients. Our brand guidelines require that each store utilizes the same design, color scheme and layout to provide a comfortable, welcoming environment across locations. Similarly, we adhere to these brand standards in our digital marketing, lending to our brand recognition in Florida and beyond.
Brand Awareness
 The foundation of our brand awareness is making top quality Trulieve branded products that are effective. In Florida, we believe that the Trulieve brand is already identified with quality and consistency; using our proven model to build similar brand associations in new markets is the next step in our expansion plan.
 We also partner with strategic brands that are or will be featured in Trulieve locations. To date, we have announced partnerships with Bhang, Binske, Loves Oven, SLANG and Blue River. PurePenn has an exclusive license to the Moxie brand in Pennsylvania.  Each strategic partner is a consumer favorite with a strong following, unique value proposition and market penetration strategy.
 The third tier of our brand awareness consists of local partnerships. Our first local partnership was with Sunshine Cannabis, a Florida-based company with a focus on bringing back unique Florida-based cannabis strains such as “Sunshine Kush” and “Gainesville Green”. As a result of their grass roots marketing efforts, each of the two vape pen SKUs featuring these cannabis strains sold out within 48 hours of launch. We also have a partnership with the Bellamy Brothers, offering flower products in strains such as “Big Love”, “Reggae Cowboy” and “Afterglow”.

Multiple Channels of Distribution
 To meet patient needs, we provide patients with several different purchase options. Patients can order products for delivery on-line or by calling our call-center. We offer delivery service across Florida. Patients can also place orders for in-store pick-up either online or via our call-center. Finally, patients are able to walk in to any Trulieve dispensary location and place an order in person.
Truliever Loyalty Program and Communication Platforms
 The Truliever program is a patient-based loyalty program in which patients earn points for dollars spent and receive discounts when their points exceed specified thresholds. Trulievers are also the first to be informed about special discounts or limited product releases and are invited to exclusive Truliever promotions and events. We understand each consumer has unique communication preferences and capabilities. As such, we engage with patients and physicians through a variety of methods including email, text, social media and online chat.
Research and Development
 We have a dedicated research and development team focused on product development and technological innovation. Our R&D team evaluates new technologies and performs rigorous testing prior to recommending new products for introduction into production. The team monitors developments in the fast-paced cannabis industry and adjacent industries to help us remain competitive.
Competitive Conditions and Position
 We face competition from companies that may have greater capitalization, access to public equity markets, more experienced management or more maturity as a business. We believe that most competitors in the cannabis market consists of localized businesses (those doing business in a single state). There are several multistate operators with whom we compete directly. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter markets through acquisitive growth are also considered part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we execute our growth strategy, operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. 
Florida
 The Office of Medical Marijuana Use, or OMMU, regulates the vertically integrated medical marijuana program in the state of Florida. Each operator is required to have a licensed cultivation, processing and dispensing site. As of December 25, 2020, there were 22 operators with 301 dispensaries (of which Trulieve operated 70) serving 456,594 patients in the state of Florida. Based on the December 25, 2020 OMMU report, Trulieve sold approximately 47% of the oil products and 55% of the smokable marijuana in Florida. The closest competitors are Surterra Wellness and Curaleaf. Surterra Wellness had 39 dispensaries or 13% of the total dispensaries and sold approximately 13% of the oil products and 10% of the smokable marijuana. Curaleaf had 33 dispensaries or 11% of the total dispensaries and sold approximately 8% of the oil products and 8% of the smokable marijuana. Other Florida competitors include Growhealthy (iAnthus), Columbia Care Florida, Liberty Health Sciences, AltMed Florida (Mu¨V) and Fluent, all of which have fewer dispensaries and less market share.  According to Arcview/BDS Analytics, the Florida cannabis market is expected to grow to more than $2.6 billion by 2025, a CAGR of 25.3% from 2019.
California
 California’s Office of Administrative Law approved the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which is the general framework for the regulation of commercial medicinal and adult-use cannabis in California. California has the oldest and most saturated cannabis market in the US. It’s also the largest cannabis market in the world with an estimated $4.3 billion in sales annually. There were approximately 608 operational dispensaries in early 2020. According to Arcview/BDS Analytics, the California cannabis market is expected to grow to more than $7.4 billion by 2025, a CAGR of 16.7%, from 2019.
Connecticut
 Connecticut’s Medical Marijuana Program is not currently accepting new applications and only issued licenses after selecting winners in response to a competitive RFP process. Currently, there are 18 dispensaries which source product from four licensed cultivators. The four licensed cultivators are Green Thumb Industries (GTI), Curaleaf, CTPharma and Theraplant. In addition to having one of the cultivation licenses Curaleaf operates four of the dispensaries.  According to Arcview/BDS Analytics, the Connecticut cannabis market is expected to grow to more than $355 million by 2025, a CAGR of 22.7%, from 2019.

Massachusetts
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s Cannabis Control Commission, or CCC, tightly regulates its medical and adult use market. As of February 15, 2021, CCC has approved 313 Marijuana Retailer Licenses, 236 Marijuana Cultivation Licenses, and 181 Marijuana Product Manufacturer Licenses. Marijuana Retailer Licenses combine Medical and Adult use licenses. Notable competitors in Massachusetts include Ascend, Acreage Holdings, Cresco Labs, Cultivate, Curaleaf, Columbia Care, Diem Cannabis, MedMen, Harvest, Cookies and Surterra Wellness. Massachusetts regulations pit these competitors against each other in the highly competitive Host Community Agreement, or HCA, process. The HCA process gives invitations to dispensaries to operate within their city. Operators must obtain an HCA for a retail store, cultivation facility, and product manufacturing facility.
 As of November 17, 2020, of the 351 municipalities in the Commonwealth, approximately 167 had bans, no zoning, or have not responded. In addition, approximately 62 municipalities had reached their license caps and 122 had zoning in place allowing for applications. Dispensaries compete for real estate locations for retail stores and in cultivation with respect to canopy size. The CCC has an 11 tier categorization for cultivation starting with a canopy limit of 5,000 square feet on tier 1 up to a canopy limit of 100,000 square feet on tier 11. As of June 2020 there were 129 cultivation applications with a maximum possible canopy of 3,645,000 square feet in Massachusetts, of which only six licensed entities were Tier 11.  According to Arcview/BDS Analytics, the Massachusetts cannabis market is expected to grow to more than $1.46 billion by 2025, a CAGR of 16.4%, from 2019.
 Pennsylvania
 Pennsylvania licenses three different types of marijuana organizations: dispensaries, grower-processors, and clinical registrants. A clinical registrant license allows the license holder to grow, process, and dispense medical marijuana in conjunction with an accredited medical school. The Commonwealth’s Medical Marijuana Act authorized the Department of Health to issue up to 25 grower-processor licenses and 50 dispensary licenses. The Department of Health is authorized to license up to eight clinical registrants and has licensed seven thus far. The Department of Health has discretion to expand the number of dispensary and grower-processor permits as necessary.
 A dispensary license allows the licensee to dispense medical marijuana from the permitted location(s). No person may own more than five individual dispensary permits. A permit may be used to dispense medical marijuana at up to three locations as approved by the Department. Pennsylvania issued 27 dispensary licenses during Phase I of its medical marijuana program. Applicants were allowed to apply to operate up to three dispensary locations in a given region. Ten licensees obtained approval to open three locations, five licensees obtained approval to open two locations, and the remaining twelve licensees gained approval to open one location. During Phase II, Pennsylvania issued 23 dispensary licenses, with four licensees obtaining approval to open two locations and fifteen obtaining approval to open one location (none obtained approval to open three locations). Notable competitors include Columbia Care, GTI, Curaleaf and Harvest who controls 12 dispensaries.  According to Arcview/BDS Analytics, the Pennsylvania market is expected to grow to $770 million by the end of 2025, a CAGR of 10.6%, from 2019.
 West Virginia
 The West Virginia Office of Medical Cannabis has awarded ten cultivation permits, ten processor permits, and one hundred dispensary permits.  Licensees are required to establish operations in West Virginia within a six-month start-up period.  As of March 1, 2021, no dispensaries have opened in West Virginia.
Key Business Objectives 
 Trulieve will continue to focus on rapid growth in Florida, Connecticut, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and West Virginia while also moving into other states to expand the reach of our brand. We will continue to execute on our established business plan of being the clear market leader in the State of Florida. Our growth plans are comprised of three key strategies. In the next 12 months, we expect to:  

• | Expand Current Cultivation and Production Operations: We will continue to scale cultivation and production operations as justified by supply-demand market dynamics, expanding our Florida indoor cultivation facilities and opening a cultivation and processing facility in Massachusetts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Current Market Retail Footprint: We will continue to scale retail locations in Florida and Massachusetts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We lease all of our store locations, two of our five cultivation sites in Florida and our combined cultivation and production sites in each of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. We do not have any one lease representing over 10% of our consolidated leasing costs and, as a result, do not consider any of our leases to be material. In addition, in Florida we own one production facility, have a second owned production facility under construction and have recently acquired real property for an additional cultivation site.
Specialized Skills
 We recruit talented individuals to join the Trulieve team. Our employees have a wide range of skill sets, including employees with PhD and master’s degrees. Many of our employees are college graduates and have specific skills related to their job function. We intend to continue to build out our research and development team with scientists and other technical specialists. We use a variety of recruiting techniques, including online resources as well as recruiting professionals, to assist with filling specialized roles.
Supply Chain 
 In the Florida market, we are a true seed-to-sale company and, as such, control the supply chain and distribution of our products. Aside from hardware components that are readily available, such as childproof packaging, and ingredients which are readily available, such as olive oil or coconut oil, raw materials are produced by us. Materials not produced in-house are purchased at market prices from vetted suppliers.
Brand Recognition and Intellectual Property
 Hackney Nursery, a predecessor to Trulieve US, has been registered as a nursery in the State of Florida since June 2, 1981 and we were awarded a license to operate in Florida as a Medical Marijuana Dispensing Organization in 2015. Since that time, we have built brand recognition throughout the State of Florida. Trulieve maintains a consistent approach to the design of each of its stores to create a uniform experience for its patients.
 We have received trademark approval from the State of Florida for the name Trulieve. We own the domain name trulieve.com as well as several related domain names. We have not registered any patents nor are we in the process of registering any patents. We rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. To the extent we are required to make disclosure regarding specific proprietary or trade secret information, such information is redacted prior to public disclosure.
 Year-Round Business 
 Our business is year-round and neither cyclical nor seasonal.
 Diversity, Inclusion & Equity
 We are committed to contributing positively to the legal cannabis industry. As a business that produces and distributes a product that many people – especially people of color – were arrested and incarcerated for in the past, we recognize the supreme importance of promoting diversity, inclusivity, and equity in the cannabis industry. As such, we have launched a Diversity & Inclusion Committee comprised of executives, senior management, and a diversity consultant. The committee is charged with implementing and recording the efficacy of our efforts to recruit and develop diverse talent, implement company-wide diversity and cultural competency training, increase supplier diversity, engage in social justice initiatives and more.
Regulatory Overview
 Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. Trulieve US is directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale or distribution of cannabis in the medicinal cannabis marketplace in the State of Florida. Leef Industries is directly involved in the possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis in the medicinal and adult-use cannabis marketplace in the State of California. Life Essence is in the process of building out its infrastructure to engage in cannabis cultivation, processing and retailing in the medicinal and adult-use cannabis marketplace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. PurePenn and Solevo Wellness are directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale or distribution of cannabis in the medicinal cannabis marketplace in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Trulieve WV intends to engage in cannabis processing and retailing in the medicinal cannabis marketplace in the State of West Virginia.

Federal Regulation of Cannabis in the United States
 The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse; no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. Moreover, as of February 4, 2021 and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, although Mississippi’s medical cannabis legalization measure is under challenge.  Fifteen of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure is subject to potential challenge.  In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized marijuana for medical use.
 Unlike in Canada, which uniformly regulates the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of marijuana at the federal level under the Cannabis Act (Canada), marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in those states where we maintain such licenses (Florida, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and West Virginia), strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us.
 In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of DOJ memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum.
 The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:
  
1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
---+----------------------------------------------------


2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
---+------------------------------------------------------------

 On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.
 11

On January 21, 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States.  President-elect Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Justice Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a useful use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.
 Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of ‎marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the ‎applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States ‎Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such ‎potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce ‎current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 As an industry ‎best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we abide by the following standard operating policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure ‎compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:‎
  
1. | Continuously monitor our operations for compliance with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Ensure that our cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements);
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Implement policies and procedures to prevent the distribution of our cannabis products to minors;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Implement policies and procedures in place to avoid the distribution of the proceeds from our operations to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to reliably track inventory and prevent the diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across any state lines in general;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Monitor the operations at our facilities so that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs or engaging in any other illegal activity; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Implement quality controls so that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to avoid adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and discourage impaired driving.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we frequently conduct background checks to confirm that the principals and management of our operating subsidiaries are of good character and have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or the use of firearms in the cultivation, manufacturing or distribution of cannabis. We also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of our cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate and the policies and procedures that are related to the possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises. 
 Moreover, in recent years, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the medical marijuana and hemp industries have also been in effect.  For instance, certain marijuana businesses receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of temporary appropriations measures that have been enacted into law as amendments (or “riders”) to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by both Presidents Obama and Trump.  For instance, in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress included a budget “rider” that prohibits DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a state's implementation of its own medical marijuana laws.   The rider is known as the “Rohrbacher-Farr” Amendment after its original lead sponsors. Originally, a Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate passed the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment. The bill was “a bipartisan appropriations measure that looks to prohibit the DEA from spending funds to arrest state-licensed medical marijuana patients and providers.”  Subsequently, the amendment has been included in multiple budgets passed by a Republican-controlled Congress.  While the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment has been included in successive appropriations legislation or resolutions since 2015, its inclusion or non-inclusion is subject to political change.
 12

The Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment was extended most recently in the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2021, which funds the agencies of the federal government through September 30, 2021. Notably, Rohrbacher-Farr has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. If the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase.
 United States Border Entry
 The United States Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, enforces the laws of the United States as they pertain to lawful travel and trade into and out of the U.S. Crossing the border while in violation of the CSA and other related United States federal laws may result in denied admission, seizures, fines, and apprehension. CBP officers administer determine the admissibility of travelers who are non-U.S. citizens into the United States pursuant to the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. An investment in our Subordinate Voting Shares, if it became known to CBP, could have an impact on a non-U.S. citizen’s admissibility into the United States and could lead to a lifetime ban on admission. 
 Because marijuana remains illegal under United States federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry, or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with United States marijuana businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-US citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers that previous use of marijuana, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the marijuana industry in the United States could also be reason enough for CBP to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada’s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances and because marijuana continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that, employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of companies involved in business activities related to marijuana in the United States (such as Trulieve), who are not United States citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States.
 Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Access to Banking
 The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve anti-money laundering, financial recordkeeping and the proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (referred to herein as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States.
 Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of any Schedule I controlled substance. For example, banks and other financial institutions could potentially be prosecuted and convicted of aiding and abetting money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act for providing services to cannabis businesses. Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other financial service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy.
 While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical or adult-use marijuana, FinCEN, in 2014, issued guidance, or the FinCEN Guidance, to prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes. The FinCEN Guidance is viewed as advising prosecutors not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses so long as that marijuana-related business activities are legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memorandum are being violated (such as keeping marijuana out of the hands of organized crime). Importantly, the FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide financial services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including through enhanced customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps typically include:
  
1. | Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Requesting available information about the business and related parties from state licensing and enforcement authorities;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
4. | Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers);
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in the FinCEN Guidance; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for banks and financial institutions considering servicing the cannabis industry, in practice it has not increased banks’ willingness to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. This is because current U.S. federal law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence (i.e. enhanced due diligence) on each marijuana-related business they accept as a customer.
 Those commercial banks and/or credit unions that have agreed to work with marijuana businesses are typically limiting those accounts to small percentages of their total deposits to avoid creating liquidity and concentration risk. Since, theoretically, the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to marijuana-related businesses at any time and without notice, these banks and credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from marijuana-related businesses in a single day, while also keeping sufficient liquid capital on hand to service their other customers. Because many banks and credit unions that are providing banking services to marijuana-related businesses are smaller institutions, applicable concentration limits may also impose limits in the aggregate amounts of loans that might be provided to the industry. Those commercial banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry can charge marijuana businesses high fees to cover the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance.
 Unlike the Cole Memorandum, however, the FinCEN Guidance has not been rescinded, but FinCEN has stated that it views the FinCEN Guidance to include compliance with the requirements of the rescinded Cole Memorandum. Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, has not made any public statements with regards to how the Treasury Department plans to treat marijuana-related businesses.
 As an industry best practice and consistent with its standard operating procedures, Trulieve adheres to all customer due diligence steps in the FinCEN Guidance and any additional requirements imposed by those financial institutions it utilizes. However, in the event that any of our operations, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such operations in the United States were found to be in violation of anti-money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions could be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends or effect other distributions.  
 In the United States, the “SAFE Banking Act” was adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives, which would grant banks and other financial institutions immunity from federal criminal prosecution for servicing marijuana-related businesses if the underlying marijuana business follows state law. The SAFE Banking Act was not considered by the U.S. Senate by the end of the legislative session, and that legislation will now have to be reintroduced and considered by both houses of the U.S. Congress.. While there is strong support in the public and within Congress for the SAFE Banking Act and similar legislation, there can be no assurance that it will be passed as presently proposed or at all. In both Canada and the United States, transactions involving banks and other financial institutions are both difficult and unpredictable under the current legal and regulatory landscape. Legislative changes could help to reduce or eliminate these challenges for companies in the cannabis space and would improve the efficiency of both significant and minor financial transactions.
 Ability to Access Public and Private Capital
 Given the current laws regarding cannabis at the federal level in the United States, traditional bank financing is typically not available to United States marijuana companies. Specifically, since financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under anti-money laundering statutes, the unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Banks who do accept deposits from cannabis-related businesses in the United States must do so in compliance with the FinCEN Guidance. We have banking relationships with Florida, Massachusetts and Connecticut state-chartered banks for deposits and payroll, however we do not have access to traditional bank financing. 
 14

Tax Concerns
 An additional challenge for marijuana-related businesses is that the provisions of IRC Section 280E are being applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use marijuana industry. IRC Section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a marijuana business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be. Furthermore, although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of cost of goods sold, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted.
The 2018 Farm Bill
 CBD is a nonintoxicating chemical found in cannabis and is often derived from hemp, which contains, at most, only trace amounts of THC. On December 20, 2018, Former President Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the 2018 Farm Bill) into law. Until the 2018 Farm Bill became law, hemp fell within the definition of “marijuana” under the CSA and the DEA classified hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance because hemp is part of the cannabis plant.
 The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% by dry weight and removes hemp from the CSA. The 2018 Farm Bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, to, among other things: (1) evaluate and approve regulatory plans approved by individual states for the cultivation and production of industrial hemp, and (2) promulgate regulations and guidelines to establish and administer a program for the cultivation and production of hemp in the U.S. The regulations promulgated by the USDA will be in lieu of those states not adopting state-specific hemp regulations. Hemp and products derived from it, such as CBD, may then be sold into commerce and transported across state lines provided that the hemp from which any product is derived was cultivated under a license issued by an authorized state program approved by the USDA and otherwise meets the definition of hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill also explicitly preserved the authority of the FDA to regulate hemp-derived products under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Company expects that the FDA will promulgate its own rules for the regulation of hemp-derived products in the coming year. Notwithstanding the pending FDA rules, on October 29, 2019, the USDA published its proposed rules for the regulation of hemp, (referred to herein as the “USDA Rule”). The USDA Rule will go into effect immediately upon the conclusion of the public comment period and publication in the federal register by the USDA, expected to be on or around March 22, 2021. The USDA Rule, among other things, sets minimum standards for the cultivation and production of hemp, as well as requirements for laboratory testing of hemp.
 Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States
 We are classified as having a “direct” involvement in the United States cannabis industry and we believe that we are in compliance with applicable state laws, as well as related licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by the States of Florida, California, Connecticut and West Virginia, and the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. We are not subject to any citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks which may have an impact on our licenses, business activities or operations. We use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that our business is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by Florida, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and West Virginia through the advice of our Director of Compliance, who monitors and reviews our business practices and changes to applicable state laws and regulations, as well as United States Federal enforcement priorities. Our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel works with external legal advisors in Florida, Massachusetts, California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and West Virginia to ensure that we are in on-going compliance with applicable state laws.
 In the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Although each state in which we operate (and anticipate operating) authorizes, as applicable, medical and/or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, and numerous other states have legalized marijuana in some form, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under U.S. federal law. Although we believe that our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws of the United States, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to marijuana may neither absolve us of liability under U.S. federal law, nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings brought against us may result in a material adverse effect on our business.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Florida
 In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act, or CUA, which was a low-THC (CBD) law, allowing cannabis containing not more than 0.8%THC to be sold to patients diagnosed with severe seizures or muscle spasms and cancer. The CUA created a competitive licensing structure and originally allowed for one vertically integrated license to be awarded in each of five regions. The CUA set forth the criteria for applicants as well as the minimum qualifying criteria which included the requirement to hold a nursery certificate evidencing the capacity to cultivate a minimum of 400,000 plants, to be operated by a nurseryman and to be a registered nursery for at least 30 continuous years. The CUA also created a state registry to track dispensations. In 2016, the Florida Legislature passed the Right to Try Act, or RTA, which expanded the State’s medical cannabis program to allow for full potency THC products to be sold as “medical marijuana” to qualified patients.
 15

In November of 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization ballot initiative (referred to herein as the “Initiative”) to expand the medical cannabis program under the RTA was approved by 71.3% of voters, thereby amending the Florida constitution. The Initiative is now codified as Article X, Section 29 of the Florida Constitution. The Initiative expanded the list of qualifying medical conditions include cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV and AIDS, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class or comparable to those other qualifying conditions and for which a physician believes the benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. The Initiative also provided for the implementation of state-issued medical cannabis identification cards. In 2017, the Florida Legislature passed legislation implementing the constitutional amendment and further codifying the changes set forth in the constitution into law. The 2017 law provides for the issuance of 10 licenses to specific entities and another four licenses to be issued for every 100,000 active qualified patients added to the registry. The 2017 law also initially limited license holders to a maximum of 25 dispensary locations with the ability to purchase additional dispensary locations from one another, and for an additional five locations to be allowed by the State for every 100,000 active qualified patients added to the registry. The 2017 legislation’s cap on dispensing facilities expires in April 2020.
 Trulieve US License (the “Florida License”)
 
 
Holding Entity | Permit/ License | City | Expiration/Renewal Date (if applicable) (MM/DD/YY) | Description 
Trulieve, Inc. | Medical Marijuana Treatment Center | Statewide | 07/24/22 | Cultivation, Processing/ Manufacturing, Dispensary, Transport

 
Under Florida law, a licensee is required to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis. Licenses are issued by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use, or OMMU, and may be renewed biennially. Trulieve US received its most recent license renewal on June 13, 2018 and is classified as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, or MMTC, under Florida law.
 In Florida, there is no state-imposed limitation on the permitted size of cultivation or processing facilities, nor is there a limit on the number of plants that may be grown.
 Under our license, we are permitted to sell cannabis to those patients who are entered into Florida’s electronic medical marijuana use registry by a qualified physician and possess a state-issued medical marijuana identification card and a valid certification from the qualified physician. The physician determines patient eligibility as well as the routes of administration (e.g. topical, oral, inhalation) and the number of milligrams per day a patient is able to obtain under the program. The physician may order a certification for up to three 70-day supply limits of marijuana, following which the certification expires and a new certification must be issued by a physician. The number of milligrams dispensed, the category of cannabis (either low-THC or medical marijuana) and whether a delivery device such as a vaporizer has been authorized is all recorded in the registry for each patient transaction. In addition, smokable flower was approved by the legislature and signed into law in March 2019. Patients must obtain a specific recommendation from their physician to purchase smokable flower. The maximum amount a patient may obtain is 2.5 ounces (measured by weight) of smokable flower per 35-day supply.
 We are authorized to sell a variety of products and offer over 550 SKUs in various product categories for sale. OMMU implemented rules regulating the production and sale of edible products in August of 2020, and the Company’s Florida licensee shortly thereafter became the first MMTC to dispense edibles in Florida. The use of hydrocarbon solvents for the extraction of products was also contemplated in the 2017 law and is also awaiting rulemaking by the OMMU.
 Dispensaries may be located in any location zoned as appropriate for a pharmacy throughout the State of Florida as long as the local government has not expressly prohibited MMTC dispensaries in their respective municipality. Additionally, dispensaries must be located more than 500 feet from a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school. Following the adoption of the cap on total dispensaries by each MMTC, as discussed above, our Florida licensee filed a claim in the Court for the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County challenging the dispensary cap and asking the court to disregard the dispensary locations we had open and/or applied for prior to the limitation becoming effective. On February 4, 2019, we announced that we won our lawsuit in the trial court, with the court ruling that we may open an additional 14 dispensary locations based on these locations having previously vested. Moreover, the court ruled that in the alternative, the statutory caps placed on the number of dispensaries allowed across the state were not only unconstitutionally added after Amendment 2 had been approved by voters but were also adversely impacting patient access. We have since settled our challenge with the Florida Department of Health. Our 14 dispensaries that were established before the statewide cap was enacted are now excluded from the statutory cap. The statutory cap expired in April 2020, thus neither Trulieve US nor its competitors in Florida are subject to restrictions on the number of dispensaries that may be opened. As of December 31, 2020, we had 70 approved dispensaries in the State of Florida. In addition, our license allows us to deliver products directly to patients.

Florida Reporting Requirements
 Florida law called for the OMMU to establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of certain events, including when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Each medical marijuana treatment center shall use the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU or integrate its own seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU. At this time the OMMU has not implemented a statewide seed-to-sale tracking system and we use our own system. Additionally, the OMMU also maintains a patient and physician registry and the licensee must comply with all requirements and regulations relative to the provision of required data or proof of key events to said system in order to retain its license. Florida requires all MMTCs to abide by representations made in their original application to the State of Florida or any subsequent variances to same. Any changes or expansions of previous representations and disclosures to the OMMU must be approved by the OMMU via an amendment or variance process.
Florida Licensing Requirements
 Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the licensee continues to meet the requirements of the Florida Statute 381.986 and pays a renewal fee. License holders can only own one license within the State of Florida. Applicants must demonstrate (and licensed MMTC’s must maintain) that: (i) they have been registered to do business in the State of Florida for the previous five years, (ii) they possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, (iii) they have the technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce cannabis, including, but not limited to, low-THC cannabis, (iv) they have the ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC, (v) they have the ability to maintain accountability of all raw materials, finished products, and any by-products to prevent diversion or unlawful access to or possession of these substances, (vi) they have an infrastructure reasonably located to dispense cannabis to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the OMMU, (vii) they have the financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the two-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the OMMU, (viii) all owners, officers, board members and managers have passed a Level II background screening, inclusive of fingerprinting, (ix) they ensure that a medical director is employed to supervise the activities of the MMTC, and (x) they have a diversity plan and veterans plan accompanied by a contractual process for establishing business relationships with veterans and minority contractors and/or employees. Upon approval of the application by the OMMU, the applicant must post a performance bond of up to US $5 million, which may be reduced to US $2 million once the licensee has served 1,000 patients (which Trulieve has accomplished).
 There is a pending lawsuit that challenges important aspects of the 2017 Legislation and OMMU regulations and could have an impact on our business in Florida.  In December 2017, Florigrown, LLC and other plaintiffs challenged as unconstitutional aspects of the 2017 Legislation and OMMU regulations that: (1) require MMTCs to be vertically integrated (i.e., cultivate and process the cannabis to be sold at the MMTC’s own licensed dispensaries); (2) that cap the total number of MMTC licenses in the state; and (3) that authorized the OMMU to issue MMTC licenses to certain applicants that met criteria defined by the 2017 legislation.  On October 18, 2019, a trial judge in the Circuit Court for Leon County ruled that Florigrown, LLC had a substantial likelihood of succeeding on its claims, holding that the vertical integration and licensing cap conflicted with the language in Article X, Section 29 and that the provisions in the 2017 defining the criteria for eligibility for MMTC licensure constituted an impermissible “special law” under Article III, Section 11(a)(12) of the Florida Constitution.  On July 10, 2019, an intermediate appellate court affirmed aspects of the Circuit Court for Leon County’s ruling.  The matter is now pending before Florida Supreme Court.  The Florida Supreme Court heard additional oral argument in the case on October 7, 2020. 
 Security and Storage Requirements for Cultivation, Processing and Dispensing Facilities in Florida
 Adequate outdoor lighting is required from dusk to dawn for all MMTC facilities. 24-hour per day video surveillance is required and all MMTCs must maintain at least a rolling 45-day period that is made available to law enforcement and the OMMU upon demand. Alarm systems must be active at all items for all entry points and windows. Interior spaces must also have motion detectors and all cameras must have an unobstructed view of key areas. Panic alarms must also be available for employees to be able to signal authorities when needed.
 In dispensaries, the MMTC must provide a waiting area with a sufficient seating area. There must also be a minimum of one private consultation/education room for the privacy of the patient(s) and their caregiver (if applicable). The MMTC may only dispense products between 7:00 am and 9:00 pm. All active products must be kept in a secure location within the dispensary and only empty packaging may be kept in the general area of the dispensary which is readily accessible to customers and visitors. No product or delivery devices may be on display in the waiting area.
 17

An MMTC must at all times provide secure and logged access for all cannabis materials. This includes approved vaults or locked rooms. There must be at least two employees of the MMTC or an approved security provider on site at all times. All employees must wear proper identification badges and visitors must be logged in and wear a visitor badge while on the premises. The MMTC must report any suspected activity of loss, diversion or theft of cannabis materials within 24 hours of becoming aware of such an occurrence.
 Florida Transportation Requirements
 When transporting cannabis to dispensaries or to patients for delivery, a manifest must be prepared and transportation must be done using an approved vehicle. The cannabis must be stored in a separate, locked area of the vehicle and at all times while in transit there must be two people in a delivery vehicle. During deliveries, one person must remain with the vehicle. The delivery employees must at all times have identification badges. The manifest must include the following information: (i) departure date and time; (ii) name, address and license number of the originating MMTC; (iii) name and address of the receiving entity; (iv) the quantity, form and delivery device of the cannabis; (v) arrival date and time; (vi) the make, model and license plate of the delivery vehicle; and (vii) the name and signatures of the MMTC delivery employees. These manifests must be kept by the MMTC for inspection for up to three years. During the delivery, a copy of the manifest is also provided to the recipient.
 OMMU Inspections in Florida
 The OMMU may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of MMTC’s to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OMMU is to inspect an MMTC upon receiving a complaint or notice that the MMTC has dispensed cannabis containing mold, bacteria, or other contaminants that may cause an adverse effect to humans or the environment. The OMMU is to conduct at least a biennial inspection of each MMTC to evaluate the MMTC’s records, personnel, equipment, security, sanitation practices, and quality assurance practices.
Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has authorized the cultivation, possession and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Massachusetts marijuana businesses. The Medical Use of Marijuana Program, or MUMP, registers qualifying patients, personal caregivers, Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, or MTCs, and MTC agents. MTCs were formerly known as Registered Marijuana Dispensaries, or RMDs. The MUMP was established by Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012, “An Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana”, following the passage of the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative, Ballot Question 3, in the 2012 general election. Additional statutory requirements governing the MUMP were enacted by the Legislature in 2017 and codified at G.L. c. 94I, et. seq. (referred to herein as the “Massachusetts Medical Act”). MTC Certificates of Registration are vertically integrated licenses in that each MTC Certificate of Registration entitles a license holder to one cultivation facility, one processing facility and one dispensary locations. There is a limit of three MTC licenses per person/entity.
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, or CCC, regulations, 935 CMR 501.000 et seq. (referred to herein as the “Massachusetts Medical Regulations”), provide a regulatory framework that requires MTCs to cultivate, process, transport and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Patients with debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) when such diseases are debilitating, and other debilitating conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient’s healthcare provider.
 The CCC assumed control of the MUMP from the Department of Public Health on December 23, 2018. The CCC approved revised regulations for the MUMP on November 30, 2020, which will become effective when published in the Massachusetts Register. 
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Medical)
 The Massachusetts Medical Regulations delineate the licensing requirements for MTCs in Massachusetts. Licensed entities must demonstrate the following: (i) they are licensed and in good standing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; (ii) no executive, member or any entity owned or controlled by such executive or member directly or indirectly controls more than three MTC licenses; (iii) an MTC may not cultivate medical cannabis from more than two locations statewide; (iv) MTC agents must be registered with the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission; (v) an MTC must have a program to provide reduced cost or free marijuana to patients with documented verifiable financial hardships; (vi) one executive of an MTC must register with the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Services on behalf of the entity as an organization user of the Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system; (vii) the MTC applicant has at least $500,000 in its control as evidenced by bank statements, lines of credit or equivalent; and (viii) payment of the required application fee.
 18

In an MTC application, an applicant must also demonstrate or include: (i) the name, address date of birth and resumes of each executive of the applicant and of the members of the entity; (ii) a plan to obtain liability insurance coverage in compliance with statutes; (iii) detailed summary of the business plan for the MTC; (iv) an operational plan for the cultivation of marijuana including a detailed summary of policies and procedures; and (v) a detailed summary of the operating policies and procedures for the MTC including security, prevention of diversion, storage of marijuana, transportation of marijuana, inventory procedures, procedures for quality control and testing of product for potential contaminants, procedures for maintaining confidentiality as required by law, personnel policies, dispensing procedures, record keeping procedures, plans for patient education and any plans for patient or personal caregiver home delivery. An MTC applicant must also demonstrate that it has (i) a successful track record of running a business; (ii) a history of providing healthcare services or services providing marijuana for medical purposes in or outside of Massachusetts; (iii) proof of compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; (iv) complied with the laws and orders of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and (v) a satisfactory criminal and civil background. Finally, an MTC applicant must specify a cultivation tier for their license, which establishes the minimum and maximum square footage of canopy for their cultivation operation.
 Upon the determination by the CCC that an MTC applicant has responded to the application requirements in a satisfactory fashion, the MTC applicant is required to pay the applicable registration fee and shall be issued a Provisional MTC license and, following completion of certain regulatory requirements, a Final MTC license. Trulieve’s wholly owned subsidiary, Life Essence, holds the following MTC licenses.
 Massachusetts Licenses (Medical) (the “Massachusetts Licenses”)
 
 
Holding Entity | Permit/ License | City | Expiration/Renewal Date (if applicable) (MM/DD/YY) | Description 
Life Essence | Provisional MTC License | Holyoke, MA | 12/6/21 | Dispensary Cultivation/ Product Manufacturing Dispensary 
Life Essence | Final MTC License | Northampton, MA | 12/6/21 | Dispensary 
 | | Holyoke, MA | | Cultivation/ Product

 | | | | Dispensary 
Life Essence | Provisional MTC License | Cambridge, MA | 12/6/21 | Dispensary 
 | | Holyoke, MA | | Cultivation/ Product 
 | | | | Manufacturing 
 | | | | Dispensary 

 
After receipt of a Provisional MTC license, the CCC shall review architectural plans for the building of the MTC’s cultivation facility and/or dispensing facilities, and shall either approve, modify or deny the same. Once approved, the MTC provisional license holder shall construct its facilities in conformance with the requirements of the Massachusetts Regulations. Once the CCC completes its inspections and issues approval for an MTC of its facilities, the CCC shall issue a Final MTC License to the MTC applicant. Final MTC Licenses are valid for one year, and shall be renewed by filing the required renewal application no later than sixty days prior to the expiration of the certificate of registration. A licensee may not begin cultivating marijuana until it has been issued a Final MTC License by the CCC.
 MTC Licenses in Massachusetts are renewed annually. Before expiry, licensees are required to submit a renewal application. While renewals are granted annually, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Life Essence would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Medical)
 An MTC shall follow its written and approved operation procedures in the operation of its dispensary locations. Operating procedures shall include (i) security measures in compliance with the Massachusetts Regulations; (ii) employee security policies including personal safety and crime prevention techniques; (iii) hours of operation and after-hours contact information; (iv) a price list for marijuana; (v) storage and waste disposal protocols in compliance with state law; (vi) a description of the various strains of marijuana that will be cultivated and dispensed, and the forms that will be dispensed; (vii) procedures to ensure accurate recordkeeping including inventory protocols; (viii) plans for quality control; (ix) a staffing plan and staffing records; (x) diversion identification and reporting protocols; and (xi) policies and procedures for the handling of cash on MTC premises including storage, collection frequency and transport to financial institutions. The siting of dispensary locations is expressly subject to local/municipal approvals pursuant to state 
 19

law, and municipalities control the permitting application process that a MTC must comply with. More specifically, an MTC is to comply with all local requirements regarding siting, provided however that if no local requirements exist, an MTC shall not be sited within a radius of 500 feet of a school, daycare center, or any facility in which children commonly congregate. The 500-foot distance under this section is measured in a straight line from the nearest point of the facility in question to the nearest point of the proposed MTC. The Massachusetts Regulations require that MTCs limit their inventory of seeds, plants, and useable marijuana to reflect the projected needs of registered qualifying patients. An MTC may only dispense to a registered qualifying patient or caregiver who has a current valid certification.
 Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Medical)
 An MTC is to implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the MTC. These measures must include: (i) allowing only registered qualifying patients, caregivers, dispensary agents, authorized persons, or approved outside contractors access to the MTC facility; (ii) preventing individuals from remaining on the premises of an MTC if they are not engaging in activities that are permitted; (iii) disposing of marijuana or by-products in compliance with law; (iv) establishing limited access areas accessible only to authorized personnel; (v) storing finished marijuana in a secure locked safe or vault; (vi) keeping equipment, safes, vaults or secured areas securely locked; (vii) ensuring that the outside perimeter of the MTC is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance; and (viii) ensuring that landscaping or foliage outside of the RMD does not allow a person to conceal themselves. An MTC shall also utilize a security/alarm system that: (i) monitors entry and exit points and windows and doors, (ii) includes a panic/duress alarm, (iii) includes system failure notifications, (iv) includes 24-hour video surveillance of safes, vaults, sales areas, areas where marijuana is cultivated, processed or dispensed, and (v) includes date and time stamping of all records and the ability to produce a clear, color still photo. The video surveillance system shall have the capacity to remain operational during a power outage. The MTC must also maintain a backup alarm system with the capabilities of the primary system, and both systems are to be maintained in good working order and are to be inspected and tested on regular intervals.
Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Medical)
 Marijuana or marijuana-infused products, or MIPs, may be transported between licensed MTCs by MTC agents on behalf of an MTC. MTCs or deliver-only retailers may, with CCC approval, transport marijuana or MIPS directly to registered qualifying patients and Caregivers as part of a home delivery program. An MTC shall staff transport vehicles with a minimum of two dispensary agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle when the vehicle contains marijuana or MIPs. Prior to leaving the origination location, an MTC must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, the marijuana to be transported.
 Marijuana must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper-proof packaging prior to and during transportation. In the case of an emergency stop, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. An MTC shall ensure that delivery times and routes are randomized. Each MTC agent shall carry his or her CCC-issued MUMP ID Card when transporting marijuana or MIPs and shall produce it to CCC representatives or law enforcement officials upon request. Where videotaping is required when weighing, inventorying, and accounting of marijuana before transportation or after receipt, the video must show each product being weighed, the weight, and the manifest. An MTC must document and report any unusual discrepancy in weight or inventory to the CCC and local law enforcement within 24 hours. An MTC shall report to the CCC and local law enforcement any vehicle accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable incidents that occur during transport, within 24 hours. An MTC shall retain transportation manifests for no less than one year and make them available to the CCC upon request. Any cash received from a qualifying patient or personal caregiver must be transported to an MTC immediately upon completion of the scheduled deliveries. Vehicles used in transportation must be owned, leased or rented by the MTC, be properly registered, and contain a GPS system that is monitored by the MTC during transport of marijuana and said vehicle must be inspected and approved by the CCC prior to use.
 During transit, an MTC is to ensure that: (i) marijuana or MIPs are transported in a secure, locked storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana or MIPs; (ii) the storage compartment cannot be easily removed (for example, bolts, fittings, straps or other types of fasteners may not be easily accessible and not capable of being manipulated with commonly available tools); (iii) marijuana or MIPs are not visible from outside the vehicle; and (iv) product is transported in a vehicle that bears no markings indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport marijuana or MIPs and does not indicate the name of the MTC. Each MTC agent transporting marijuana or MIPs shall have access to a secure form of communication with personnel at the origination location when the vehicle contains marijuana or MIPs.
 CCC Inspections (Medical)
 The CCC or its agents may inspect an MTC and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice. An MTC shall immediately upon request make available to the CCC information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, and the CCC may direct an MTC to test marijuana for contaminants. Any violations found will be noted in a deficiency statement that will be provided to the MTC, and the MTC shall thereafter submit a Plan of Correction to the CCC outlining with particularity each deficiency and the timetable and steps to remediate the same. The CCC shall have the authority to suspend or revoke a certificate of registration in accordance with the applicable regulations.

Regulation of the Adult-Use Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
 Adult-use (recreational) marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC licenses adult-use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (referred to herein collectively as “Marijuana Establishments”) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018. The CCC approved revised regulations for the adult-use program effective November 1, 2019 and January 8, 2021. 
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
 Many of the same application requirements exist for an adult-use Marijuana Establishment license application as to those for a medical MTC application, and each owner, officer or member must undergo background checks and fingerprinting with the CCC. Applicants must submit the location and identification of each site, and must establish a property interest in the same, and the applicant and the local municipality must have entered into a host agreement authorizing the location of the adult-use Marijuana Establishment within the municipality, and said agreement must be included in the application. Applicants must include disclosure of any regulatory actions against it by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the civil and criminal history of the applicant and its owners, officers, principals or members. The application must include, amongst other information, the proposed timeline for achieving operations, liability insurance, business plan, and a detailed summary describing the Marijuana Establishment’s proposed operating policies including security, prevention of diversion, storage, transportation, inventory procedures, quality control, dispensing procedures, personnel policies, record keeping, maintenance of financial records, diversity plans, and employee training protocols.
Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Adult-Use)
 Marijuana retailers are subject to certain operational requirements in addition to those imposed on Marijuana Establishments generally. Dispensaries must immediately inspect patrons’ identification to ensure that everyone who enters is at least 21 years of age. Dispensaries may not dispense more than one ounce of marijuana or five grams of marijuana concentrate per transaction. Point-of-sale systems must be approved by the CCC, and retailers must record sales data. Records must be retained and available for auditing by the CCC and Department of Revenue. Retailers are required to conduct monthly analyses of equipment and sales data to determine that such systems have not been altered or interfered with to manipulate sales data, and to report any such discrepancies to the CCC.

Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Adult-Use)
 Marijuana products may only be transported between licensed Marijuana Establishments by registered Marijuana Establishment agents. A licensed marijuana transporter may contract with a Marijuana Establishment to transport that licensee’s marijuana products to other licensed establishments. All transported marijuana products are linked to the seed-to-sale tracking program. Any marijuana product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination Marijuana Establishment shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting marijuana products shall be staffed with a minimum of two Marijuana Establishment agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana or marijuana products. Prior to the products leaving a Marijuana Establishment, the originating Marijuana Establishment must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the receiving Marijuana Establishment, the receiving establishment must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products transported. Marijuana products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. In the case of an emergency stop during the transportation of marijuana products, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. A Marijuana Establishment or a marijuana transporter transporting marijuana products is required to ensure that all transportation times and routes are randomized and remain within Massachusetts.

 Regulation of the Marijuana Market in California
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This provided an affirmative defense for defendants charged with the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law, decriminalizing the use, possession, and collective cultivation of medical marijuana, and establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the “Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act,” or MCRSA. The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created testing laboratories, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the “Adult Use of Marijuana Act,” or AUMA, creating an adult-use marijuana program for adult-use 21 years of age or older. In June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, or MAUCRSA, which amalgamated MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern the medical and adult-use licensing regime for marijuana businesses in the State of California. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. The three primary licensing agencies that regulate marijuana at the state level are the Bureau of Cannabis Control, or BCC, California Department of Food and Agriculture, or CDFA, and the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH.
 One of the central features of MAUCRSA is known as “local control.” In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use marijuana business in California, an operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license-holders to operate in cities or counties with marijuana licensing programs. Cities and counties in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators, or, alternatively, can choose to ban marijuana licenses.

Holding Entity | Permit/ License | City | Expiration/Renewal Date (if applicable) (MM/DD/YY) | Description
Leef Industries, LLC | Adult-Use Retailer | Palm Springs, CA | 11/08/21 | Dispensary 

 
Once an operator obtains local approval, the operator must obtain state licenses before conducting any commercial marijuana activity. There are multiple license categories that cover all commercial activity. Categories include: (1) cultivation/nurseries, (2) testing laboratories, (3) distributors/transporters, (4) retailers, (5) microbusinesses, (6) event organizers, and (7) manufacturers. Categories of licenses are further broken down into subtypes. For example, there are multiple types of cultivation licenses available depending upon the size of the cultivation operation and whether the operation is indoors/outdoors or uses mixed lighting. Different manufacturing licenses are available depending upon whether volatile or nonvolatile solvents are used. Retail licenses are available depending upon whether the retailer operates from a store-front or a non-store front.
 California Agencies Regulating the Commercial Cannabis Industry
 The CDFA oversees nurseries and cultivators; the CDPH oversees manufacturers, and the BCC oversees distributors, retailers, delivery services, and testing laboratories. Operators must apply to one or more of these agencies for their licenses, and each agency has released regulations specific to the operation of the types of businesses they oversee. The BCC has a number of regulations that apply to all licensees, but the CDFA and CDPH regulations only apply to the licensees in their charge.
The Marijuana Supply Chain in California
 In California, depending on a local government’s own marijuana ordinances, plants may be cultivated outdoors, using mixed-light methods, or fully indoors. Cultivators must initially acquire seeds, clones, teens, or other immature plants from nurseries.
 24

The cultivation, processing, and movement of marijuana within the state is tracked by the METRC system, into which all licensees are required to input their track and trace data (either manually or using another software that automatically uploads to METRC). Immature plants are assigned a Unique Identifier number, or UID, and this number follows the flowers and biomass resulting from that plant through the supply chain, all the way to the consumer. Each licensee in the supply chain is required to meticulously log any processing, packaging, and sales associated with that UID.
 When marijuana plants mature and complete their life cycle, they are harvested cured, and trimmed, in preparation of being sold to distributors or manufacturers. Cultivators have two main products: flowers, or “buds,” and the biomass, or “trim,” which is typically removed from the mature flowers. Trim is commonly sold to Manufacturers for further processing into cannabis extracts. Buds may also be sold to Manufacturers, or to Distributors for sale to Retailers. The Cultivator may package and label its marijuana flowers or may sell flower in bulk and the Distributor may package and label the flower.
 Manufactured marijuana goods may be sold from a manufacturer to a Distributor but must be provided to Distributors in their final packaging. Distributors may not package manufactured marijuana goods. Certain tax rates apply to the marijuana flower and biomass, which are assessed per ounce of product sold. The California State excise tax is paid by the Cultivator to the Distributor, or alternatively the Manufacturer, and it is the Distributor that has the responsibility of tendering the excise taxes to the State of California.
 Marijuana in California may only be transported by licensed distributors. Some cultivators and manufacturers have their own distribution licenses, and others contract with third party distributors. Distributors may or may not take possession of the marijuana and marijuana products. This has evolved in such a way that, similar to the alcohol distribution model, retailers are choosing from a portfolio of products carried by the Distributors they work with. Brands are doing some direct marketing to Retailers, but many Brands target their marketing to Distributors.
 Distributors are the point in the supply chain where final quality assurance testing is performed on products before they go to a retailer. Retailers may not accept product without an accompanying certificate of analysis, or COA. Distributors must hold product to be tested on their premises in “quarantine” and arrange for an employee of a licensed testing laboratory to come to their premises and obtain samples from any and all goods proposed to be shipped to a retailer. Marijuana and marijuana products are issued either a “pass” or “fail” by the testing laboratory. Under some circumstances, the BCC’s regulations allow for failing product to be “remediated” or to be re-labeled to more accurately reflect the COA.
 Retail Compliance in California
 California requires that certain warnings, images, and content information be printed on all marijuana packaging. BCC regulations also include certain requirements about tamper-evident and child-resistant packaging. Distributors and retailers are responsible for confirming that products are properly labeled and packaged before they are sold to a customer. 
 Consumers aged 21 and up may purchase marijuana in California from a dispensary with an “adult-use” license. Some localities still only allow medicinal dispensaries. Consumers aged 18 and up with a valid physician’s recommendation may purchase marijuana from a medicinal-only dispensary or an adult-use dispensary. Consumers without valid physician’s recommendations may not purchase marijuana from a medicinal-only dispensary. All marijuana businesses are prohibited from hiring employees under the age of 21.
 Security Requirements
 Each local government in California has its own security requirements for cannabis businesses, which usually include comprehensive video surveillance, intrusion detection and alarms, and limited access areas in the dispensary. The State also has similar security requirements, including that there be limited-access areas where only employees and other authorized individuals may enter. All Licensee employees must wear employee badges. The limited access areas must be locked with “commercial-grade, nonresidential door locks on all points of entry and exit to the licensed premises.”
 Each licensed premises must have a digital video surveillance system that can “effectively and clearly” record images of the area under surveillance. Cameras must be in a location that allows the camera to clearly record activity occurring within 20 feet of all points of entry and exit on the licensed premises. The regulations list specific areas which must be under surveillance, including places where cannabis goods are weighed, packed, stored, loaded, and unloaded, security rooms, and entrances and exits to the premises. Retailers must record point of sale areas on the video surveillance system.
 Licensed retailers must hire security personnel to provide on-site security services for the licensed retail premises during hours of operation. All security personnel must be licensed by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services.
 California also has extensive record-keeping and track and trace requirements for all licensees.
 25

Inspections
 All licensees are subject to annual and random inspections of their premises. Cultivators may be inspected by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California Regional Water Quality Control Boards, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Manufacturers are subject to inspection by the California Department of Public Health, and Retailers, Distributors, Testing Laboratories, and Delivery services are subject to inspection by the Bureau of Cannabis Control. Inspections can result in notices to correct, or notices of violation, fines, or other disciplinary action by the inspecting agency.
 Retail taxes in California
 Retailers generally must pay the excise tax to final distributors when they make wholesale purchases. These distributors then remit the retail excise taxes to the California Department of Tax Fee Administration, or CDTFA, which administers State cannabis taxes. Retailers must make these payments before they sell the products to consumers, so the tax is based directly on the wholesale price (the price that retailers pay to distributors) rather than the retail price (the price that consumers pay to retailers). The CDTFA sets the tax based on its estimate of the average ratio of the average ratio of retail prices to wholesale prices— commonly known as a ‘markup’. CDTFA’s current markup estimate (as of January 1, 2020) is 80%. Due to the 15% statutory tax rate and the 80% markup estimate, the current effective tax rate on wholesale gross receipts is 27%.
 In addition, the State taxes, cities and counties throughout California apply their own approaches to taxing cannabis. These approaches fall into three broad categories. First, many local governments impose the same tax rate on all cannabis businesses regardless of type. Second, many local governments impose higher tax rates on retailers than other types of cannabis businesses. Third, a few local governments license cannabis businesses but do not levy taxes specifically on cannabis. The California Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates that the average cumulative local tax rate over the whole supply chain is roughly equivalent to a 14% tax on retail sales.
 After receiving approval from the BCC in August 2020, we own 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Leef Industries. We have and will only engage in transactions with other licensed California marijuana businesses and have a compliance officer to oversee dispensary operations in California. We are developing standard operating procedures for this and future California holdings to ensure consistency and compliance across our California holdings. We and, to the best of our knowledge, Leef Industries, are in compliance with California’s marijuana regulatory program.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Connecticut
 The State of Connecticut has authorized cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Connecticut marijuana businesses. The Medical Marijuana Program, or MMP, registers qualifying patients, primary caregivers, Dispensary Facilities, or DFs, and Dispensary Facility Employees, or DFEs. The MMP was established by Connecticut General Statutes §§ 21a-408–21a429. DFs and production facilities are separately licensed.
 The MMP is administered by the Department of Consumer Protection, or DCP. Patients with qualifying debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including patients with such conditions include but are not limited to cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Parkinson’s disease, or multiple sclerosis (MS). A physician or advanced practice registered nurse must issue a written certification for an MMP patient, and the qualifying patient or caregiver must choose one designated DF where the patient’s marijuana will be obtained.
 Connecticut Licensing Requirements
 In Connecticut, marijuana may not be produced or dispensed without the appropriate license. The DCP determines how many facility licenses to issue based on the size and location of the DFs in operation, the number of qualifying patients registered with the DCP, and the convenience and economic benefits to qualifying patients.
 When the DCP determines that additional licenses for DFs should be granted, it publishes a notice of open applications for DF licenses. This notice must include the maximum number of licenses to be granted, the deadline for receipt of applications, and the criteria that will be considered when awarding the licenses. Such criteria must include character and fitness of any person who may have control or influence over the operation of the proposed DF; the location for the proposed DF; the applicant’s ability to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, or loss of marijuana; the applicant’s ability to maintain the knowledge, understanding, judgment, procedures, security controls and ethics to ensure optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of marijuana; and the extent to which the applicant or any of the applicant’s DF backers have a financial interest in another licensee, registrant, or applicant.
 Applicants for DF licenses must identify, among other things, the proposed DF location, financial statements, criminal background check applications for the applicant and applicant’s backers, a plan to prevent theft and diversion, and a blueprint of the proposed DF. An application for a DF license also requires the payment of a $5,000 fee. If approved, the licensee must pay an additional $5,000 before receiving its license. The decision of the DCP’s Commissioner, or Commissioner, not to award a DF license to an applicant is final.

• | A DF may transfer, distribute, deliver or transport marijuana to an approved laboratory.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Only a pharmacist licensed as a dispensary may dispense marijuana, and only a dispensary or dispensary technician may sell marijuana to qualifying patients, primary caregivers, or research program subjects who are registered with the DCP. A DF may not engage in marijuana compounding, except that a dispensary may dilute a medical marijuana product with a USP grade substance with no active ingredient for the purposes of dose titration, tapering, for the addition of a flavoring agent, or to create a maintenance dose that is not available from any producer at the time of purchase. No person associated with a DF may enter into any agreement with a certifying health care provider or health care facility concerning the provision of services or equipment that may adversely affect any person’s freedom to choose the DF at which the qualifying patient or primary caregiver will purchase marijuana, except in the case of an approved research program.
 All DFEs must, at all times while at the DF, have their current dispensary license, dispensary technician registration or DFE registration available for inspection by the Commissioner or the DCP. The DF shall establish, implement and adhere to a written alcohol-free, drug-free and smoke-free workplace policy, which must be available to the DCP upon request. Marijuana may not be applied, ingested, or consumed inside a DF.
 Each DF must make publicly available the price of all its marijuana products to prospective qualifying patients and primary caregivers. All marijuana must be sold in child-resistant, sealed containers except upon a written request from the qualifying patient or primary caregiver. No marijuana may be sold without the producer label. All products sold to the qualifying patient or primary caregiver must be placed in an opaque package that shall not indicate the contents of the package, the originating facility or in any other way cause another person to believe that the package may contain marijuana. Each DF must also provide information to qualifying patients and primary caregivers regarding the possession and use of marijuana. The DF manager must submit all informational material to the Commissioner for approval prior to such information being provided to qualifying patients and primary caregivers.
 Connecticut Security and Storage Requirements
 All facilities must have an adequate security system to prevent and detect loss of marijuana. These systems must use commercial grade equipment, including perimeter alarms, motion detectors, video cameras with 24-hour recordings (which must be retained for at least 30 days), silent alarms, panic alarms, a failure notification system, and the ability to remain operational during a power outage. Each facility must also have a back-up alarm system approved by the Commissioner. The outside perimeter of every facility must be well-lit. All equipment must be kept in good working order and tested at least twice per year.
 27

A DF must:
  
• | Not maintain marijuana in excess of the quantity required for normal, efficient operation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Store all marijuana in an approved safe or approved vault and in such a manner as to prevent diversion, theft or loss;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain all marijuana in a secure area or location accessible only to specifically authorized employees, which shall include only the minimum number of employees essential for efficient operation;

Upon delivery, the marijuana must immediately be placed in an approved safe or approved vault within the dispensary.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 No person may enter the area where marijuana is dispensed and sold unless such person is licensed or registered by the DCP; such person’s responsibilities necessitate access to the dispensary department and then for only as long as necessary to perform the person’s job duties; or such person has a patient or caregiver registration certificate, in which case such person must not be permitted behind the service counter or in other areas where marijuana is stored.
 Connecticut Transportation Requirements
 Prior to transporting any marijuana or marijuana product, a DF must complete a shipping manifest using a form prescribed by the Commissioner and securely transmit a copy of the manifest to the laboratory, research program location, hospice, or other inpatient care facility that will receive the products and to the DCP at least 24 hours prior to transport. These manifests must be maintained and made available to the DCP. Marijuana may only be transported in a locked, secure storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana. This compartment may not be visible from outside the vehicle. Routes must be randomized.
 All transport vehicles must be staffed with a minimum of two employees. At least one delivery team member is required to remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana. A delivery team member must have access to a secure form of communication with employees at the originating facility at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana. A delivery team member must physically possess a department-issued identification card at all times when transporting or delivering marijuana and must produce it to the Commissioner or law enforcement official upon request.
 No marijuana may be sold, dispensed or distributed via a delivery service or any other manner outside of a DF, except that a primary caregiver may deliver marijuana to the caregiver’s qualified patient and a DFE may deliver to a hospice or other inpatient care facility licensed by the Department of Public Health that has a protocol for handling and distributing marijuana that has been approved by the DCP.
 Inspections by the Commissioner
 All documents required to be kept by a facility must be maintained in an auditable format for no less than three years. These records must be provided to the Commissioner or an authorized delegate immediately upon request. Additionally, the Commissioner and authorized delegates may enter any place, including a vehicle, where marijuana is held, produced, or otherwise handled, and inspect in a reasonable manner such place and all pertinent items and documents within it.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Pennsylvania 
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16, or Act 16, and provided access to state residents with one or more qualifying conditions. Pennsylvania has promulgated regulations to implement Act 16, which are primarily found in Chapters 1131 through 1210 of the Pennsylvania Code. 
 28

Under Act 16, medical marijuana refers to marijuana obtained for certified medical use by a Pennsylvania resident with at least 1 of 23 qualifying medical conditions as set by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, or DOH, pursuant to Act 16. Act 16 initially authorized 17  qualifying conditions, however, through regulatory approval, that list has expanded and now includes anxiety disorders, ALS, Autism, Cancer, Crohn’s Disease, damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord with neurological indication of intractable spasticity, Dyskinetic & spastic movement disorders, Epilepsy, Glaucoma, HIV & AIDS, Huntington’s Disease, IBD, Intractable Seizures, Multiple Sclerosis, Neurodegenerative diseases, Neuropathy, opioid disorder, Parkinson’s disease, PTSD, severe chronic pain of neuropathic origin or which conventional therapy is ineffective, Sickle Cell Anemia, a terminal illness, and Tourette Syndrome.
 Under Act 16 and the DOH’s implementing regulations, patients who are residents of the Commonwealth and have a qualifying medical condition as certified by a physician are able to obtain medical marijuana at approved dispensaries with the Commonwealth. A registered caregiver of an approved patient may also obtain medical marijuana from an approved dispensary. As of March 1, 2021, Pennsylvania does not permit home delivery of medical marijuana. 
 Pennsylvania Licenses and Regulations
 Act 16 authorized 2 principal categories of permits: (1) a grower/ processor facility permit, and (2) a dispensary facility permit. The Pennsylvania Department of Health was authorized to issue up to 25 grower/processor permits and up to 50 dispensary permits. A dispensary permit holder may have up to 3 dispensary locations within the primary region in which it is located.  The Commonwealth is divided into 6 regions with permits being awarded based on patient population. The Commonwealth originally awarded only 12 grower/processor permits and 27 dispensary permits. Subsequently, the Commonwealth granted additional grower/processor and dispensary permits as part of its phase II application process.  Pennsylvania also allows for a clinical registrant permit which allows clinical registrant permit holders to operate both a grower/ processor operation and multiple dispensary locations. Additionally, clinical registrants must partner with an approved medical research institution within the Commonwealth to conduct marijuana-based clinical research programs. All permit holders are required to use the state-approved seed-to-sale tracking software for all inventory management, tracking and dispensations. Pennsylvania currently utilizes the MJFreeway platform. 
 All grower/processor and dispensary facilities must register with the DOH. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to continuing reporting and annual renewal requirements. A grower/processor permit allows a permit holder to acquire wholesale from another grower/processor, possess, cultivate, and manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. A grower/processor may transport products itself or may contract with an approved transporter. A grower/processor is not limited to the region it is located in and may distribute medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products to any approved dispensary facility within the Commonwealth.
 Approved dispensaries may only purchase approved medical marijuana products and marijuana-infused products from a permitted grower/processor and may only dispense to certified patients or caregivers who present valid identification cards. Prior to dispensing medical marijuana products to a patient or caregiver, the dispensary shall: (1) verify the validity of the patient or caregiver identification card using the electronic tracking system; and (2) review the information on the patient’s most recent certification by using the electronic tracking system to access the DOH’s database. The following requirements apply: (i) if a practitioner sets forth recommendations, requirements or limitations as to the form and/or dosage of a medical marijuana product on the patient certification, the medical marijuana product dispensed to a patient or caregiver by a dispensary must conform to those recommendations, requirements or limitations; (ii) if a practitioner does not set forth recommendations, requirements or limitations as to the form or dosage of a medical marijuana product on the patient certification, the physician, pharmacist, physician assistant or certified registered nurse practitioner employed by the dispensary and working at the facility shall consult with the patient or the caregiver regarding the appropriate form and dosage of the medical marijuana product to be dispensed; and (iii) the dispensary shall update the patient certification in the electronic tracking system by entering any recommendation as to the form or dosage of medical marijuana product that is dispensed to the patient.

Pennsylvania Department of Health Inspections 
 The Pennsylvania Department of Health may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the medical marijuana organization’s compliance with its permit. An investigation or inspection may include an inspection of a medical marijuana organization’s site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information.
Regulation of the Cannabis Market in West Virginia
 On April 19, 2017, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice signed into law Senate Bill 386, which creates a medical cannabis program for West Virginia residents with serious medical conditions, and permits medical cannabis to be cultivated, processed, and dispensed to registered patients in essentially non-combustible forms.  The program is administered by the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Office of Medical Cannabis.  The Office has authority to (1) issue and oversee permits that authorize businesses to grow, process, or dispense medical cannabis in compliance with state law and regulations, (2) register medical practitioners who certify patients as having qualifying serious medical conditions, and (3) register and oversee patients with qualifying conditions. 
 The statute establishes a list of qualifying conditions, including (1) cancer, (2) positive status for HIV/AIDS, (3) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (4) Parkinson’s disease, (5) multiple sclerosis, (6) spinal cord injury, (7) epilepsy, (8) neuropathy, (9) Huntington’s disease, (10) Crohn’s disease, (11) post-traumatic stress disorder, (12) intractable seizures, (13) sickle cell anemia, (14) severe chronic pain, and (15) illness with a prognosis of less than one year of life expectancy.
 In addition to Senate Bill 386, codified in Chapter 16A of the West Virginia Code, the Office of Medical Cannabis has also promulgated regulations governing the activities of growers, processors, laboratories, dispensaries, and general provisions of West Virginia’s medical marijuana program. 
 West Virginia Licenses and Regulations
 The West Virginia statute creates three categories of licenses that a cannabis business may obtain: (1) grower, (2) processor, and (3) dispensary, corresponding to the growing of medical cannabis, the processing of cannabis plants into the products permitted under West Virginia law, and sales to registered patients, respectively. The statute provides that the Office may issue up to 10 grower permits, 10 processor permits, and 100 dispensary permits, and that it may not (1) issue more than 1 grower permit to one person, (2) issue more than 1 processor permit to one person, and (3) issue more than 10 dispensary permits to one person.  
 The Office of Medical Cannabis awarded 10 grower permits on October 3, 2020.  It awarded 10 processor permits on November 13, 2020.  It awarded 100 dispensary permits on January 29, 2021, and announced that, beginning February 3, 2021, West Virginia residents with qualifying medical conditions would be able to begin to submit applications to become registered patients. The Office awarded the following permits to Trulieve WV:
 
 
Holding Entity | Permit/ License | City | Expiration/Renewal Date (if applicable) (MM/DD/YY) | Description 
Trulieve WV, Inc. | P060009 | Huntington | 11/13/21 | Medical Cannabis Processor 
Trulieve WV, Inc. | D490079 | Buckhannon | 1/28/22 | Medical Cannabis Dispensary

Trulieve WV, Inc. | D200078 | Charleston | 1/28/22 | Medical Cannabis Dispensary
Trulieve WV, Inc. | D210081 | Weston | 1/28/22 | Medical Cannabis Dispensary

 Permits issued by the Office of Medical Cannabis are effective for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed by applicants in good standing with the terms of a currently-effective permit. Permits may be suspended or revoked on the basis of failure to prevent diversion of medical cannabis, or violation of laws and rules applicable to medical cannabis businesses.
 All permittees are required to make use of a state-mandated electronic tracking system that is accessible to the Office.  Permittees are also subject to requirements related to security and surveillance, recordkeeping and record retention, the acquisition, growing, and processing of medical cannabis, delivery and transportation, and controls on dispensing, including amounts and prices permitted. Growers and processors are required to contract with independent laboratories to test their products according to Office of Medical Cannabis rules.
 30

Dispensaries are prohibited from dispensing cannabis products to anyone other than a registered patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card from the Office.  Dispensing amounts are limited to those indicated in a registered patient’s certification by his/her medical practitioner, and in any event a dispensary may not dispense more than a 30-day supply at a given time.  
 The Office is permitted to conduct announced or unannounced inspections of permittees to determine their compliance with West Virginia law and regulations, and may inspect a permittee’s site, records, and other data, and may interview employees, principals, operators, and financial backers of the permittee.
