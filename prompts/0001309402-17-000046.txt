 Item 1.  Business. 
 ﻿
 References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Green Plains,” or the “company” refer to Green Plains Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Green Plains is an Iowa corporation, founded in June 2004 as an ethanol producer. We have grown through acquisitions of operationally efficient ethanol production facilities and adjacent commodity processing businesses. We are focused on generating stable operating margins through our diversified business segments and risk management strategy. We own and operate assets throughout the ethanol value chain: upstream, with grain handling and storage; through our ethanol production facilities; and downstream, with marketing and distribution services to mitigate commodity price volatility, which differentiates us from companies focused only on ethanol production. Our other businesses leverage our supply chain, production platform and expertise.
 ﻿
 We formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to be our primary downstream storage and logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol we produce. The partnership completed its IPO on July 1, 2015. We own a 62.5% limited partner interest, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of the partnership’s incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 35.5% limited partner interest. The partnership is consolidated in our financial statements.
 ﻿
 As a result of acquisitions during the year, we implemented organizational segment changes during the fourth quarter of 2016. We now group our business activities into the following four operating segments to manage performance:    ﻿

· | Ethanol Production. Our ethanol production segment includes the production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at 17 ethanol plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. At capacity, we expect to process approximately 524 million bushels of corn per year and produce approximately 3 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.5 billion gallons of ethanol, 4.1 million tons of distillers grains and 340 million pounds of industrial grade corn oil, making us the second largest consolidated owner of ethanol plants in North America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Agribusiness and Energy Services. Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain procurement, with approximately 60.3 million bushels of grain storage capacity, and our commodity marketing business, which markets, sells and distributes ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethanol for a third-party producer as well as buy and sell ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, crude oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Food and Food Ingredients. Our food and food ingredients segment includes a cattle feedlot operation with the capacity to support 73,000 head of cattle and grain storage capacity of approximately 2.8 million bushels, and Fleischmann’s Vinegar, one of the world’s largest producers of food-grade industrial vinegar. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Partnership. Our master limited partnership provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. The partnership’s assets include 39 ethanol storage facilities, 8 fuel terminal facilities and approximately 3,100 leased railcars. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risk Management and Hedging Activities
 ﻿
 Our profitability is highly dependent on commodity prices, particularly for ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, corn, natural gas and cattle. Since market price fluctuations among these commodities are not always correlated, ethanol production or our cattle feedlot operation may be unprofitable at times. We use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to monitor real-time operating price risk exposure at each of our operations to obtain favorable margins, when available, or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. Our multiple businesses and revenue streams also help to diversify our operations and profitability.
 ﻿
 We use forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and vinegar production or buy some of the corn, natural gas, cattle, or ethanol we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas, ethanol, cattle and other commodities. The financial impact of these activities depends on price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver those commodities. We do not speculate on general price movements by taking significant unhedged positions on commodities.
 ﻿
 Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying commodity and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all.
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We are focused on managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams. Our competitive strengths include: 
 ﻿
 Disciplined Risk Management.  Risk management is our core competency and we use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to maintain a disciplined approach. Our internally developed operating margin management system allows us to monitor commodity price risk exposure at each of our operations and lock in favorable margins or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. 
 ﻿
 Acquisition and Integration Capabilities.  We have the ability to acquire assets that create synergies and enhance our ability to mitigate risks. Our balance sheet allows us to be opportunistic in that process. Since inception, we built or acquired 17 ethanol plants and installed corn oil extraction technology at each of our ethanol plants to generate incremental returns. In addition, we purchased or built a grain handling and storage business, a cattle feedlot operation, a vinegar production business, and terminal and distribution facilities. Successful integration of these operations has enhanced our overall returns.
 ﻿

Operational Excellence.  Our operations are staffed by experienced industry personnel who share operational knowledge and expertise. We focus on making incremental operational improvements to enhance performance using real-time production data and systems to monitor our operations and optimize performance. Our operational expertise provides us a cost advantage over most of our competitors and helps us improve the operating margins of acquired facilities. 
 ﻿
 Vertical Integration.  Our vertically integrated platform reduces commodity and operational risk and increases pricing visibility in key markets. Combined, our ethanol production, agribusiness and energy services, food and food ingredients, and partnership segments provide efficiencies, which extend both within and outside the ethanol value chain.
 ﻿
 Proven Management Team.  Our senior management team averages more than 25 years of commodity risk management and related industry experience. We have specific expertise across all of our businesses, including plant operations and management, commodity markets and risk management, and ethanol marketing and distribution. Our management team’s level of operational and financial expertise is essential to successfully executing our business strategies.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply due to factors described below driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence goals and national security concerns: 
· | Emissions Reduction. In the 1990’s, federal law required the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline to reduce vehicle emissions in cities with unhealthy levels of air pollution, on a seasonal or year-round basis. Oxygenated gasoline is used to meet separate federal and state air emission standards. At the time, these oxygenates included ethanol and MTBE. However, the U.S. refining industry has since abandoned the use of MTBE, making ethanol the primary clean air oxygenate used. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Octane Enhancer. Ethanol has an octane value of 113 and is the primary additive used by refiners to increase octane levels, producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blend stocks and upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades, to improve engine performance. Refiners are producing more conventional blendstocks for oxygenate blending, or CBOB, which is an 84 octane sub-grade gasoline that requires ethanol or another octane source to meet the minimum octane requirements for the U.S. gasoline market. CBOB represented approximately 80% of total conventional gasoline sold in 2015. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fuel Stock Extender. Ethanol is a valuable blend component used by U.S. refiners to extend fuel supply. According to the EIA, ethanol comprised approximately 9.9% of the domestic gasoline supply, replacing nearly 750 million barrels of crude oil in 2016. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | E15 Blending Waiver. In October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver that permitted the use of E15 in model year 2001 and newer passenger vehicles, including cars, sport utility vehicles and light pickup trucks. In June 2012, the EPA approved the sale and use of E15 and in July 2012, the nation’s first retail E15 was sold. On January 24, 2017, there were 627 retail fuel stations in 28 states offering E15 to consumers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mandated Use of Renewable Fuels. In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II, which has been a driving factor in the growth of domestic ethanol usage. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. In November 2016, the EPA announced the final 2017 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol of 15.0 billion gallons, which is currently on hold pending final review by the incoming presidential administration. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Net Ethanol Exports. Prior to 2010, the United States had a long history as a net importer of ethanol. In 2010, according to the USDA, the United States became the largest exporter of ethanol to world markets and lowest-cost producer, surpassing Brazil. According to the EIA, U.S. ethanol exports, net of imports, were approximately 1.0 billion gallons in 2016 and 730 million gallons in 2015. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In light of our industry’s environment, we intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies:
 ﻿
 Grow Organically.  We continually leverage our operational expertise to identify expansion projects that maximize our production capabilities at our ethanol and vinegar plants, and cattle feedlot operations. Owning grain storage at or near our ethanol plants allows us to develop relationships with local producers and originate corn more effectively at a lower average cost. We also seek organic growth projects in adjacent businesses and downstream distribution services that take advantage

of our existing assets’ locations.
 ﻿
 Acquire Strategic Assets. We maintain a disciplined evaluation process in pursuit of strategic assets, taking into consideration rigorous design, engineering, financial and geographic criteria, to ensure the assets will generate favorable returns. We seek acquisitions that leverage our core competencies in adjacent markets, products and services with attractive margins or more predictable revenue streams.
 ﻿
 Conduct Safe, Reliable, Efficient Operations and Improve Operational Efficiency. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and employ an extensive production control system at each ethanol plant to continuously monitor performance. We use the performance data to develop strategies that can be applied across our platform. In addition, we research operational processes that may enhance our efficiency by increasing yields, lowering processing cost per gallon and growing production volumes.
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2016. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
 ﻿
 Effective January 1, 2016, we sold the storage and transportation assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities to the partnership for $62.3 million. The partnership used its revolving credit facility and cash on hand to fund the purchase of the assets, which included three ethanol storage facilities that support the plants’ combined production capacity of 160 mmgy and 224 leased railcars. In connection with this transaction, Green Plains and the partnership amended the omnibus agreement, operational services agreement, and ethanol storage and throughput agreement.
 ﻿
 Effective April 1, 2016, the company increased its ownership of BioProcess Algae to 82.8% and began consolidating the joint venture in its consolidated financial statements. Our ownership in BioProcess Algae is currently at 90.0% as of December 31, 2016. The joint venture is focused on growing algae in commercially viable quantities using feedstocks that are created as part of the ethanol production process.
 ﻿
 On June 14, 2016, we announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture with Jefferson Gulf Coast Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC, to construct and operate an intermodal export and import fuels terminal at Jefferson’s existing Beaumont, Texas terminal. The joint venture is expected to invest approximately $55 million in its Phase I development, which will initially focus on storage and throughput capabilities for multiple grades of ethanol. The terminal will have direct access to multiple transportation options, including Aframax vessels, inland and coastwise barges, trucks, and unit trains with direct mainline service from the Union Pacific, BNSF and Kansas City Southern railroads. Commercial development is expected to be complete during the second half of 2017, at which time we will offer our interest in the joint venture to the partnership.
 ﻿
 On August 15, 2016, we completed a private offering of 4.125% convertible senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $170 million that will mature on September 1, 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were used to finance subsequent acquisitions.
 ﻿
 On August 25, 2016, the partnership filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective September 2, 2016, registering an indeterminate number of debt and equity securities with a total offering price not to exceed $500,000,250. The partnership also registered 13,513,500 common units, consisting of 4,389,642 common units and 9,123,858 common units that may be issued upon conversion of subordinated units, in each case, currently held by Green Plains.
 ﻿
 On September 23, 2016, we acquired three ethanol plants located in Madison, Illinois; Mount Vernon, Indiana; and York, Nebraska, from subsidiaries of Abengoa S.A. for approximately $234.9 million in cash, plus certain working capital adjustments. The plants have combined production capacity of approximately 230 mmgy. Concurrently, the partnership acquired the ethanol storage assets related to these production facilities from us for $90 million. The partnership used its revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of the assets. In connection with this transaction, Green Plains and the partnership amended the omnibus agreement, operational services agreement, and ethanol storage and throughput agreement.
 ﻿
 On October 3, 2016, we acquired Fleischmann’s Vinegar, one of the world’s largest producers of food-grade industrial vinegar, for $258.3 million in cash, including certain post-closing adjustments. A portion of the purchase price was used to repay existing debt. The transaction was partially financed using $135 million of debt under a new credit agreement,

consisting of a $130 million term loan and $5 million borrowed under a $15 million revolving credit facility.  The balance of the transaction was paid from cash on hand.
 ﻿
 We filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC effective December 22, 2016, registering an indeterminate number of shares of common stock, warrants and debt securities.
 ﻿
 Operating Segments
 ﻿
 Ethanol Production Segment
 ﻿
 Industry Overview. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is a colorless liquid produced by fermenting carbohydrates found in a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, and other cellulosic matter found in plants. Most of the ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because it contains large quantities of carbohydrates that convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass, can be handled efficiently and is in greater supply than other grains. According to the USDA, one bushel, or 56 pounds, of corn, produces approximately 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 15.5 pounds of distillers grains and 0.7 pounds of corn oil, on average. Outside of the Unites States, sugarcane is the primary feedstock used to produce ethanol.
 ﻿
 Ethanol is a significant component of the biofuels industry, which includes all transportation fuels derived from renewable biological materials. Biofuels are an excellent oxygenate and source of octane. When added to petroleum-based transportation fuels, oxygenates reduce vehicle emissions. Ethanol is the most economical oxygenate and source of octanes available on the market and its production costs are competitive with gasoline.
 ﻿
 Ethanol Plants. We operate 17 dry mill ethanol production plants, located in nine states, that produce ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil:

The majority of our plants are equipped with industry-leading ICM or Delta-T ethanol processing technology. Our years of experience building, acquiring and operating these technologies provides us with a deep understanding of how to effectively and efficiently manage both platforms for maximum performance. 
 ﻿
 Corn Feedstock and Ethanol Production. Our plants use corn as feedstock in a dry mill ethanol production process. Each of our plants requires approximately 20 million to 44 million bushels of corn annually, depending on its production capacity. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations driven by a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs, freight costs and global demand. Ethanol producers are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to customers since ethanol competes with other fuels.
 ﻿
 Our corn supply is obtained primarily from local markets. We use cash and forward purchase contracts with grain producers and elevators to buy corn. We maintain direct relationships with local farmers, grain elevators and cooperatives, which serve as our primary sources of grain feedstock, at 14 of our ethanol plants. Most farmers in close proximity of our plants store corn in their own storage facilities. This allows us to purchase much of the corn we need directly from farmers throughout the year. At three of our ethanol plants, we contract with a third-party grain originator to supply the corn necessary for ethanol production. These contracts terminate between August 2019 and November 2023. Each of our plants is also situated on rail lines or has other logistical solutions to access corn supplies from other regions of the country should local supplies become insufficient.
 ﻿
 Corn is received at the plant by truck or rail then weighed and unloaded into a receiving building. Grain storage facilities are used to inventory grain that is passed through a scalper to remove rocks and debris prior to processing. The corn is then transported to a hammer mill where it is ground into coarse flour and conveyed into a slurry tank for enzymatic processing. Water, heat and enzymes are added to convert the complex starch molecules into simpler carbohydrates. The slurry is heated to reduce the potential of microbial contamination and pumped into a liquefaction tank where additional enzymes are added. Next, the grain slurry is pumped into fermenters, where yeast, enzymes, and nutrients are added and the batch fermentation process is started. A beer column, within the distillation system, separates the alcohol from the spent grain mash. The alcohol is dehydrated to 200-proof alcohol and either pumped into a holding tank and blended with approximately 2% denaturant as it is pumped into finished product storage tanks, or marketed as undenatured ethanol.
 ﻿
 Distillers Grains. The spent grain mash is pumped from the beer column into a decanter-type centrifuge for dewatering. The water, or thin stillage, is pumped from the centrifuge into an evaporator, where it is dried into a thick syrup. The solids, or wet cake, that exit the centrifuge are conveyed to the dryer system and dried at varying temperatures to produce distillers grains. Syrup may be reapplied to the wet cake prior to drying to provide additional nutrients. Distillers grains, the principal co-product of the ethanol production process, are used as high-protein, high-energy animal feed and marketed to the dairy, beef, swine and poultry industries. 
 ﻿
 We can produce three forms of distillers grains, depending on the number of times the solids are passed through the dryer system:

· | wet distillers grains, which contain approximately 65% to 70% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three days and is therefore sold to dairies or feedlots within the immediate vicinity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | modified wet distillers grains, which is dried further to approximately 50% to 55% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three weeks and are marketed to regional dairies and feedlots; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | dried distillers grains, which have been dried more extensively to approximately 10% to 12% moisture, have an almost indefinite shelf life and may be stored, sold and shipped to any market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

Corn Oil. Corn oil systems extract non-edible corn oil from the thin stillage evaporation process immediately before the production of distillers grains. Corn oil is produced by processing the syrup and evaporated thin stillage through a decanter-style, or disk-stack, centrifuge. The centrifuges separate the relatively light corn oil from the heavier components of the syrup, eliminating the need for significant retention time. We extract approximately 0.7 pounds of corn oil per bushel of corn used to produce ethanol. Industrial uses for corn oil include feedstock for biodiesel, livestock feed additives, rubber substitutes, rust preventatives, inks, textiles, soaps and insecticides. The syrup is blended into wet, modified wet or dried distillers grains.
 ﻿

Natural Gas.  Depending on production parameters, our ethanol plants use approximately 20,000 to 40,000 BTUs of natural gas per gallon of production. We have service agreements to acquire the natural gas we need and transport the gas through pipelines to our plants.
 ﻿
 Electricity.  Our plants require between 0.5 and 1.5 kilowatt hours of electricity per gallon of production. Local utilities supply the necessary electricity to all of our ethanol plants.
 ﻿
 Water.  While some of our plants satisfy a majority of their water requirements from wells located on their respective properties, each plant also obtains drinkable water from local municipal water sources. Each facility either uses city water or operates a filtration system to purify the well water that is used for its operations. Local municipalities supply all of the necessary water for our plants that do not have onsite wells. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled in the production process.
 ﻿
 Agribusiness and Energy Services Segment
 ﻿
 Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes five grain elevators in four states with combined grain storage capacity of approximately 11.6 million bushels, and grain storage at our ethanol plants of approximately 48.7 million bushels, detailed in the following table:
 ﻿

  ﻿
 We buy bulk grain, primarily corn and soybeans, from area producers, and provide grain drying and storage services to those producers. The grain is used as feedstock for our ethanol plants or sold to grain processing companies and area livestock producers. Bulk grain commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and spreads. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of grain, as well as grain held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges at times.

Seasonality is present within our agribusiness operations. The fall harvest period typically results in higher handling margins and stronger financial results during the fourth quarter of each year.
 ﻿
 Through Green Plains Trade, we market the ethanol we and a third party produce to local, regional, national and international customers. We also purchase ethanol from independent producers for pricing arbitrage. We sell to various markets under sales agreements with integrated energy companies; retailers, traders and resellers in the United States and buyers for export to Brazil, Canada, Europe and other international markets. Under these agreements, ethanol is priced under fixed and indexed pricing arrangements. 
 ﻿

Also through Green Plains Trade, we market wet, modified wet and dried distillers grains to local markets and dried distillers grains to local, national and international markets. The bulk of our demand is delivered to geographic regions that do not have significant local corn or distillers grains production.
 ﻿
 Our markets can be further segmented by geographic region and livestock industry. Most of our modified wet distillers grains are sold to midwestern feedlot markets. Our dried distillers grains are shipped to feedlots and poultry markets, as well as Texas and West Coast rail markets. A substantial amount of dried distillers grains are shipped by barge and rail to regional and national markets. Some of our distillers grains are shipped by truck to dairy, beef, and poultry operations in the eastern United States. We also ship by railcar to eastern and southeastern feed mills, poultry and dairy operations, and domestic trade companies. We sell dried distillers grains directly to international markets and indirectly to exporters for shipment. In 2016, we exported approximately 10% of our distillers grains production, with the largest export markets for distillers grains being Vietnam and Thailand. Access to diversified markets allows us to sell product to customers offering the highest net price.
 ﻿
 Our corn oil is sold primarily to biodiesel plants and, to a lesser extent, feedlot and poultry markets. We transport our corn oil by truck to locations in a close proximity to our ethanol plants primarily in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. We also transport corn oil by rail and barges to national markets as well as to exporters for shipment on vessels to international markets.
 ﻿
 Our railcar fleet for the agribusiness and energy services segment consists of approximately 950 leased hopper cars to transport distillers grains and approximately 180 leased tank cars to transport corn oil and crude oil. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to ten years. 
 ﻿
 Food and Food Ingredients Segment
 ﻿
 Our cattle feedlot operation has the capacity to support 73,000 head of cattle and 2.8 million bushels of grain storage capacity. We buy feeder cattle from producers, order buyers and livestock auctions, the majority of which are from Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. The finished cattle are then sold to meat processors. Bulk cattle commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and spreads. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of cattle and cattle held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges at times. 
 ﻿
 Our vinegar operation includes seven production facilities. Vinegar is sold primarily to major food industry participants, including leading branded food companies, private label food manufacturers and companies serving the foodservice channel. Products include white distilled vinegar and numerous specialty vinegars for retail and industrial uses. Vinegar is distributed primarily in bulk using 5,600 gallon tanker trailers. We also have four distribution warehouses located in California, Oregon, Texas and Quebec, Canada.    ﻿
 Partnership Segment
 ﻿
 Our partnership segment provides fuel storage and transportation services through (i) 39 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 17 ethanol production plants, (ii) eight fuel terminal facilities located near major rail lines, and (iii) a leased railcar fleet and other transportation assets. 
 ﻿
 Transportation and Delivery. Most of our ethanol plants are situated near major highways or rail lines to ensure efficient movement. We are able to move product from our ethanol plants to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge. We also manage the logistics and transportation requirements of our customers to improve our fleet’s efficiency and reduce operating costs. 
 ﻿

Deliveries within 150 miles of our plants and the partnership’s fuel terminal facilities are generally transported by truck. Deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads, allowing our plants to ship product throughout the United States.
 ﻿
 To meet the challenge of marketing ethanol and distillers grains to diverse market segments, several of our plants are capable of simultaneously handling more than 150 railcars. Some of our locations have large loop tracks with unit train loading capabilities for both ethanol and dried distillers grains and spurs to connect the loop to the mainline or allow the movement and storage of railcars on site. 
 ﻿
 The partnership’s railcar fleet consists of approximately 3,100 leased tank cars for the transportation of ethanol. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to seven years. 
 ﻿
 To optimize the partnership’s railcar assets, we transport products other than ethanol depending on market opportunities and have used a portion of our railcar fleet to transport crude oil for third parties and to lease railcars to other users.
 ﻿
 Terminal and Distribution Services. Ethanol is transported from the partnership’s terminals to third-party terminal racks where it is blended with gasoline and transferred to the loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. The partnership owns and operates fuel holding tanks and terminals, and provide terminal services and logistics solutions to markets that do not have efficient access to renewable fuels. The partnership operates fuel terminals at one owned and seven leased locations in seven states with combined storage capacity of approximately 7.4 mmg and throughput capacity of approximately 822 mmgy. We also have 39 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 17 ethanol production plants with a combined storage capacity of approximately 38.6 mmg to support current ethanol production capacity of approximately 1.5 bgy.

 Our Competition 
 ﻿
 Domestic Ethanol Competitors
 ﻿
 We are the second largest consolidated owner of ethanol plants in the United States. We compete with other domestic ethanol producers in a relatively fragmented industry. The top five producers account for approximately 45% of the domestic production capacity with production capacity ranging from 800 mmgy to 1,800 mmgy. 
 ﻿
 Our competitors also include plants owned by farmers, oil refiners and retail fuel operators. These competitors may continue to operate their plants even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations.
 ﻿
 Demand for corn from ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists in all areas and regions in which we operate. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, there were 127 operational plants in the states where we have production facilities, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, as of December 1, 2016. The largest concentration of operational plants is located in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where 50% of all operational production capacity is located.
 ﻿
 Foreign Ethanol Competitors
 ﻿
 We also complete globally with production from other countries. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer in the world after the United States. Brazil produces ethanol made from sugarcane, which may be less expensive to produce than ethanol made from corn depending on feedstock prices. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. Any significant additional ethanol production capacity could create excess supply in world markets, resulting in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. 
 ﻿
 Other Competition
 ﻿
 Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and ethanol production methods are continually under development. Ethanol production technologies also continue to evolve. We expect changes to occur primarily in the area of cellulosic ethanol, which is made from biomass such as switch grass or fast-growing poplar trees. Since all of our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, adapting our plants for a different feedstock or process system would require additional capital investments and retooling.
 ﻿
 In addition, we compete with other cattle feedlots and vinegar producers in competitive markets.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Matters
 ﻿
 Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
 ﻿
 In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or environment.
 ﻿
 RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. When RFS II was established in October 2010, the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply (ethanol production) and demand (usage of ethanol blends in older vehicles). On November 23, 2016, the EPA announced the final 2017 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol, which met the 15.0-billion-gallon congressional target for the first time, up from 14.50 billion gallons in 2016 and 14.05 billion gallons in 2015.
 ﻿
 In January 2017, the Trump administration imposed a government-wide freeze on new and pending regulations, which included the 2017 renewable volume obligations that was originally intended to go into effect on February 10, 2017. Regulatory freezes are a common practice during a change in administration and we currently believe the new presidential administration will continue to be supportive of ethanol in accordance with the current laws.

Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. In November 2016, the EPA proposed denying a petition to change the point of obligation under RFS II to the parties that own the gasoline before it is sold. In December 2016, the EPA extended the comment period to February 2017. The point of obligation does not directly impact ethanol producers; however, moving the point of obligation could indirectly affect ethanol producers.
 ﻿
 On January 18, 2017, Valero Energy Corporation filed an action against the EPA, seeking to compel the EPA to perform certain non-discretionary duties required by the RFS program under the Clean Air Act. Within the filed action, Valero claims the EPA has failed to perform these duties, namely periodic reviews of the feasibility of achieving compliance with the requirements and the impact of the requirements on each individual and entity regulated under the program, i.e, point of obligation, since 2010. Valero has requested an injunction, which if granted would require the EPA to promptly conduct rulemaking to ensure the requirements of the program are met.
 ﻿
 Several amendments to the Energy Policy Modernization Act were introduced in the U.S. Senate that were removed from consideration in early February 2016, including amendments to repeal RFS II, eliminate the corn ethanol mandate in RFS II and prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from using Commodity Credit Corporation or other funds to construct blender pumps. 
 ﻿
 CAFE was first enacted by Congress in 1975 to reduce energy consumption by increasing the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. CAFE has helped the ethanol industry by encouraging the use of E85. CAFE provides a 54% efficiency bonus to flexible-fuel vehicles running on E85. According to HIS Automotive, there are nearly 20 million flexible fuel vehicles on U.S. roads today. In addition, E85 is sold at more than 3,100 fuel stations in 46 states.
 ﻿
 Demand for cleaner, more sustainable transportation fuel is growing worldwide. Ethanol has become a crucial component of the global fuel supply as an economical oxygenate and source of octanes. According to the Global Renewable Fuels Alliance, 35 countries, including the EU which is regulated by a single policy with specific national targets for each country, have mandates or planned targets in place for blending ethanol and biodiesel with transportation fuels to reduce harmful emissions. 
 ﻿
 Government actions abroad can have significant impact on the ethanol industry. For example, China raised its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%, effective January 1, 2017.
 ﻿
 Environmental and Other Regulation
 ﻿
 Our ethanol production, agribusiness and energy services, and food and food ingredients segment activities are subject to environmental and other regulations. We obtain environmental permits to construct and operate our ethanol plants and other facilities.
 ﻿
 Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in RFS II. 
 ﻿
 While some of our plants operate as grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS II mandate, expansion above these capacities will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement. This may require us to obtain additional permits, achieve the EPA’s efficient producer status under the pathway petition program for our grandfathered plants, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. 
 ﻿
 CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS in November 2012, and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013.
 ﻿
 In January 2017, the USDA released a report providing evidence that greenhouse gas emissions associated with corn-based ethanol are 43% lower than gasoline. Numerous factors have led to improvements over the past ten years, including conservation practices by farmers, higher corn yields and advances in production technologies, which are expected to

continue and has the potential to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to a 76% as compared with gasoline.
 ﻿
 The U.S. ethanol industry relies heavily on tank cars to deliver its product to market. As of December 31, 2016, the company leases approximately 3,300 tank cars, including 3,100 leased by our partnership to transport ethanol. On May 1, 2015, the DOT finalized the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains, or DOT specification 117, which established a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol, braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. We intend to strategically manage our leased railcar fleet to comply with these regulations. Currently, all of our railcar leases expire prior to the retrofit deadline of May 1, 2023. 
 ﻿
 Parts of our business are regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Our agribusiness operations are also subject to government regulation. Our production levels are indirectly affected by federal government programs, which include the USDA, acreage control and price support programs. In addition, the grain we sell must conform to official grade standards imposed by the USDA. Other examples of government policies that may impact our business include tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos. 
 ﻿
 In September 2015, the FDA issued rules for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventative Controls for food for animals in response to FSMA. The rules require FDA-registered food facilities to address safety concerns for sourcing, manufacturing and shipping food products and food for animals through food safety programs and plans, which includes conducting hazard analyses, developing risk-based preventative controls and monitoring, and addressing intentional adulteration, recalls, sanitary transportation and supplier verification. We believe we have taken sufficient measures to comply with these regulations.
 ﻿
 On January 1, 2017, all medically important antimicrobials intended for use in animal feed that were once available over-the-counter became veterinary feed directive drugs, requiring written orders from a licensed veterinarian to purchase and use on or in livestock feed under the October 2015 revised Veterinary Feed Directive rule. Our cattle feedlot operation obtained all necessary prescriptions from a licensed veterinarian to use certain veterinary feed directive drugs, as appropriate.
 ﻿
 We employ maintenance and operations personnel at each of our plants. In addition to the attention we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations of our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
 ﻿
 BioProcess Algae Joint Venture    ﻿
 We are the majority owner of the BioProcess Algae joint venture, which was formed in 2008. The joint venture is focused on growing algae in commercially viable quantities using feedstocks that are created as part of our ethanol production process. The joint venture continues to take steps towards commercialization. We are currently focused on human and animal nutrition, using proprietary technology to customize specific products, based on proven benefits, for relevant markets.
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 On December 31, 2016, we had 1,294 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, including 177 employees at our corporate office in Omaha, Nebraska.
