 Item 1. Business 
Mitcham Industries, Inc. (MII and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, we, us and our), a Texas corporation, was incorporated in 1987. We provide equipment to the geophysical, oceanographic, hydrographic and defense industries. Headquartered in Huntsville, Texas, we have a global presence with operating locations in Salem, New Hampshire; Calgary, Canada; Brisbane, Australia; Singapore; Ufa, Bashkortostan, Russia; Budapest, Hungary; Bogota, Colombia and Shepton Mallet in the United Kingdom. We operate in two business segments, Equipment Manufacturing and Sales and Equipment Leasing. 
 Our worldwide Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment includes (a) the Seamap business, which designs, manufactures and sells specialized marine seismic equipment, (b) Klein Marine Systems, Inc. (Klein), which designs, manufactures and sells high performance side scan sonar and water-side security systems and (c) the equipment sales activities of our Australian subsidiary, Seismic Asia Pacific Pty Ltd. (SAP). 
 Our Seamap business is conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Seamap (UK) Ltd. (Seamap UK), and Seamap Pte. Ltd. (Seamap Singapore and, together with Seamap UK, Seamap). 
 We acquired Klein effective December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the operations of Klein did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations prior to the year ended January 31, 2017 (fiscal 2017). Klein has over 48 years of experience with the development and manufacture of high performance side scan sonar systems. Our side scan sonar systems are deployed by navies, port authorities, other governmental organizations, marine survey companies and universities worldwide. Klein operates from a single facility in Salem, New Hampshire. 
 Our Equipment Leasing segment is primarily engaged in the leasing of seismic equipment to companies in the oil and gas industry throughout the world. We conduct our leasing business through MII, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our branch in Colombia. We also sell new and used seismic equipment from time to time. The subsidiaries that conduct our leasing business are Mitcham Canada ULC (MCL), SAP, Mitcham Seismic Eurasia LLC (MSE), Mitcham Europe Ltd. (MEL) and Mitcham Marine Leasing Pte. Ltd. (MML). We believe we are the largest independent provider of exploration equipment to the seismic industry. 
 For additional information about our business segments, including related financial information, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
Our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world, which are described under  Customers, Sales, Backlog and Marketing. 
 Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment  
 Seamap designs, manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic, hydrographic and offshore industries. Seamaps primary products include the GunLink seismic source acquisition and control systems, commonly referred to as energy source controllers  or air gun controllers, which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources, and the BuoyLink RGPS tracking system, which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers. In May 2014, Seamap acquired two product lines from ION Geophysical Corporation (ION), Digishot® energy source controllers and Sleeve Gun energy sources. We believe that Seamap is the primary provider of energy source controllers. 
 Klein primarily designs, manufactures and sells advanced side scan sonar systems and waterside security systems for the oceanographic, hydrographic and defense industries on a world-wide basis. Kleins family of side

  scan sonar products are used in a variety of applications including hydrographic surveys, naval mine counter measure operations, search and recovery operations, ocean bottom profiling and other underwater object detection operations. 
 SAP sells equipment, consumables, systems integration, engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to companies in the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic, environmental and defense industries throughout Southeast Asia and Australia. SAP is a distributor for a number of manufacturers of products, including Klein and occasionally Seamap. 
 Seamap and Klein have overlapping customer bases and it is not uncommon for a marine survey vessel to be equipped with products from Seamap and from Klein. We expect that in the future we will have opportunities to package products from Seamap and Klein in response to requests from customers. 
 The technologies underlying the products of Seamap and Klein are similar, as are the engineering disciplines and challenges. We anticipate significant engineering collaboration between Seamap and Klein and plan to jointly develop new products. 
 The manufacturing processes of Seamap and Klein are similar. While we expect to maintain separate manufacturing operations, we do believe there will be opportunities for collaboration. Such collaboration might include using common suppliers, outsourcing specific functions between the operations and common support and repair activities. 
 For information regarding our operating results and total assets by segment, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Equipment Leasing Segment  
 We own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers. Our lease pool includes many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition, including various electronic components of land, transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems, geophones and cables, peripheral equipment, survey and other equipment. The majority of our seismic equipment lease pool is provided by the Sercel subsidiaries of Compagnie Generale de Geophysique (Sercel) and Geospace Technologies Corporation (Geospace). However, we also purchase equipment from a number of other equipment manufacturers. At January 31, 2017, approximately 58% of our equipment lease pool, on a cost basis, consisted of seismic recording channels, with the remainder consisting of geophones, energy source controllers and other peripheral equipment. 
 We lease our equipment on a short-term basis, generally for two to six months, to seismic contractors who need equipment for a particular seismic survey. Certain equipment that is used in vertical seismic profiling, or downhole operations, is generally leased to oil field service companies and often for shorter periods, ranging from a few days to two weeks. Short-term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies. A typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys. Our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crews capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew. Demand for short-term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors, including: (1) the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys, (2) seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions, (3) the term of the lease and (4) the cost of seismic equipment. We believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short-term seismic equipment leasing as a cost-effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment. Our equipment lease rates vary according to an items expected useful life, utilization, acquisition cost and the term of the lease. 
 From time to time, we sell used equipment from our lease pool in response to specific demand, dispose of older equipment or to redeploy capital.

 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to supply technologically advanced equipment solutions to our customers in the seismic, hydrographic, oceanographic and defense industries. To accomplish this, we have identified the following major objectives: 

 | Expand our product offerings in order to provide more complete solutions to customers in our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales Segment. We seek to expand our product offerings through a combination of internally developed products and the acquisition of products and technology from third parties. We believe there are opportunities for such product additions for a number of industries and applications, which we believe will further lessen our dependence on the oil and gas exploration activities. We further believe this will allow us to leverage our geographic footprint, engineering and manufacturing operations and customer relationships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maintain diverse international operations. We believe our broad geographic footprint is an important asset. We believe that we can conduct business in wide-ranging geographic areas from our existing facilities. However, for legal, tax or operational reasons, we may decide in the future to establish facilities in additional locations. We generally expect to establish any such facilities through a green field approach, but we may consider making selective acquisitions from time to time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Provide short-term rental services for technologically advanced equipment in response to customer demand. We determine the type of equipment to add to our lease pool based on the requirements of our customers. We intend to maintain the size and diversity of our equipment lease pool as dictated by customer requirements and industry conditions. We believe that the availability of a large and diverse equipment lease pool encourages seismic data acquisition contractors, oil field service providers and other marine operators to rent, rather than purchase, such equipment, due to the capital and operating efficiencies provided by short-term rentals. This strategy also entails disposing of some lease pool assets from time to time and redeploying that capital to other assets or other operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Maintain relationships with a variety of seismic equipment manufacturers. Our relationships with leading seismic equipment manufacturers provide us with access to technologically advanced equipment and allow us to expand our equipment lease pool through favorable pricing and delivery terms. We believe these relationships provide a competitive advantage.

Seismic Technology 
 Oil and gas exploration companies utilize seismic data generated from the use of digital seismic systems and peripheral equipment in determining optimal locations for drilling oil and gas wells, in the development of oil and gas reserves and in reservoir management for the production of oil and gas. These technologies are also used in mining, civil engineering operations and in marine surveying operations. 
 In the exploration and development process, oil and gas companies establish requirements for seismic data acquisition programs based on their technical objectives. Because of the expense associated with drilling oil and gas wells, decisions regarding whether or where to drill are critical to the overall process. Seismic data can also be useful in designing and monitoring complex well completion programs, such as hydraulic fracturing. As a result of the increasing requirements for this higher resolution data, which in turn requires additional channels to collect and transmit data, seismic data acquisition systems have been expanding in size during the past several years. Advances in seismic recording equipment have made it more feasible to deploy recording channels in greater density. These advances include cabled recording systems capable of handling greater amounts of data and wireless recording systems. By deploying recording channels in greater density, higher resolution images of the sub-surface can be created. Other industry advances include the use of high resolution three-component sensors (3C), which enhance the image of the sub-surface. These and other technical advances have contributed to increased drilling success rates and reduced oil and gas finding costs.

Index to Financial Statements
 Oil and gas companies have begun to utilize time lapse (4-D) seismic techniques for producing oil and gas fields. 4-D surveys involve periodically acquiring seismic data over the same area. These techniques allow the oil and gas company to monitor and analyze the production from existing properties and optimize production and reserve recovery. 
 With the expanded use of seismic technology the size of data acquisition surveys has increased substantially in the past several years. Demand for higher resolution data, larger surveys and more rapid completion of such surveys now requires seismic contractors to use data acquisition systems with a greater number of seismic recording channels. Additionally, the size of seismic surveys varies significantly, requiring frequent changes in the configuration of equipment and crews used for seismic surveys. As a result of these changes, the number of seismic survey channels has increased from smaller 2-D surveys, which typically averaged less than 1,000 channels, to larger 3-D surveys, which today are often more than 15,000 channels and sometimes use as many as 100,000 channels. We believe that many seismic contractors will continue to meet changes in equipment needs by leasing incremental equipment to expand crew size as necessary, thereby reducing the substantial capital expenditures required to purchase such equipment. 
 The principles of seismic technology are the same for land and for marine environments. However, the operational issues and therefore the equipment utilized are quite different. Essentially all of the seismic technology products in our equipment manufacturing and sales segment are for use in marine environments. The majority of our equipment leasing segment involves land based operations. 
 In certain applications, specialized seismic recording devices are deployed vertically within a well bore. Multiple recording channels, or levels, are generally deployed within a given well and are referred to as downhole or VSP (vertical seismic profiling) tools. These applications are used to provide additional data points in a traditional seismic survey, to monitor and analyze reservoir properties, and to monitor and analyze fluid treatment operations, as well as a variety of other uses. 
 Seismic surveys utilizing 2-D, 3-D or 4-D techniques require essentially the same equipment. The manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs, however. Accordingly, our equipment can generally be utilized in 2-D, 3-D and 4-D seismic surveys. 
 Side Scan Sonar Technology 
 A side scan sonar (sound navigation and ranging) system is a specialized system used for detecting objects underwater by transmitting sound energy to the right and left of the host vehicle and processing the return signals (echoes) that have bounced off the seafloor or other objects into two dimensional, photo like, images of the ocean bottom. Basic side scan sonar systems do not provide depth information nor do they penetrate the seafloor bottom. However, side scan sonar models are available that incorporate bathymetry elements (the study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors). These systems do provide bathymetric (depth) information that is co-registered with side scan data. Sub-seafloor bottom profiling can also be used in concert with side scan sonar technology to look below the seabed into the stratum layers. 
 Users of side scan sonar technology include governmental and military organizations, port and harbor authorities, fire and police departments, offshore oil and gas operators and contractors, universities and scientific organizations, mining companies, marine survey companies and marine salvage operators. Applications that utilize side scan sonar technology include the following:

 Equipment Leasing Segment  
 Equipment Leasing. We own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short-term rental to our customers, who are primarily seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers (in the case of downhole equipment). We lease this equipment multiple times until the earlier of the end of its useful life or its sale. Our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment. 
 Our land equipment lease pool includes a total of approximately 264,000 seismic recording land channels (each channel capable of electronically converting seismic data from analog to digital format and transmitting the digital data), including approximately 90,000 channels of wireless recording equipment. Included in this total is approximately 55,000 stations (165,000 channels) of three-component equipment. Other land equipment in our lease pool includes geophones and cables, heli-picker equipment, batteries and other peripheral equipment. Our lease pool of marine seismic equipment includes more than 12 kilometers of streamers (recording channels that are towed behind a vessel), air guns, streamer-positioning equipment, energy source controllers and other equipment. Our lease pool of downhole equipment includes approximately 200 levels of downhole seismic tools. Our lease pool equipment is manufactured by leading seismic equipment manufacturers and is widely used in the seismic industry. Our marine lease pool also includes energy source controllers and RGPS tracking systems that are manufactured by our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment. We estimate that as of January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximately 8.5%, 6.5%, and 14.3%, respectively, of our lease pool equipment was deployed on an active contract. 
 We maintain a master lease agreement with each of our customers that outlines the general terms and conditions of our leases. Individual transactions are generally documented through an equipment lease schedule that incorporates the terms and conditions of the master lease agreement. Individual leases generally have terms of two to six months, or a few days to two weeks in the case of downhole equipment, and are typically renewable following the initial rental period. Our equipment lease rates vary according to an items expected useful life, utilization, initial cost and the term of the lease. We provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and provide replacement equipment, as necessary. In addition, we occasionally provide field technical support services when requested by our customers. The customer is responsible for the cost of repairing equipment damages, other than normal wear and tear. In the case of lost or destroyed equipment, the customer is required to reimburse us for the replacement cost of the equipment, at a price specified in the lease agreement, or to provide acceptable replacement equipment. The customer is also normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes, other than income taxes, related to the lease of the equipment. The customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance. It is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly or daily rate, depending on the circumstances.

 Seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions. In Canada and Russia, a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months, from December through March or April. During the months in which the weather is warmer, certain areas are not accessible to trucks, earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain. Seismic survey operations can also be effected by other weather patterns such as periods of heavy rain. While these periods of heavy rain can affect our business in certain geographic regions, the primary seasonality of our business has historically related to the Canadian and Russian winter seasons. We are able, in many cases, to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization. For additional information about the impact of seasonality and weather, see Item 1A  Risk Factors. 
 Upon completion of a lease, the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities where it is inspected, tested, repaired, if necessary, and staged for another project. While the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs, during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer. Therefore, managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations. Given the short term of most of our leases, we believe that the highest achievable annual utilization for most of our equipment is approximately 65%. However, many factors can affect this utilization rate, including the term of our leases, the shipping time required to return equipment to one of our facilities, the time required to inspect, test and repair equipment after return from a lease and the demand for the equipment. 
 We maintain facilities for the inspection, testing and repair of land seismic equipment in Huntsville, Texas; Calgary, Alberta; Ufa, Bashkortostan, Russia; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Brisbane, Australia and Singapore. We maintain marine equipment inspection, testing and repair facilities in Huntsville, Texas and Singapore. We believe that this broad network of support facilities helps us effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations. 
 Lease Pool Equipment Sales. On occasion, we sell used equipment from our lease pool, normally in response to specific customer demand, declining demand for rental of specific equipment or to redeploy capital. Used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margins depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item. When used equipment is sold from our lease pool, the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold. Sales of our lease pool equipment typically occur as opportunities arise and do not have a significant seasonal aspect. Sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately $5.3 million, $2.2 million and $3.2 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 (fiscal 2017), 2016 (fiscal 2016) and 2015 (fiscal 2015), respectively. Under the terms of our lease agreements, customers are responsible for lost or destroyed equipment. Charges for such lost equipment are at prices specified in the particular lease agreement and are reflected as lease pool equipment sales in the accompanying financial statements. 
 Other Equipment Sales. The Other equipment sales included in our Equipment Leasing segment generally fall into two broad categories: 
 

 | Sales of heli-pickers and related equipment. We sell a variety of equipment and supplies utilized in the deployment and retrieval of seismic equipment by helicopter, some of which we produce.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sales of miscellaneous equipment and related services. On occasion, we will sell seismic equipment and components that we acquire from manufacturers in response to a specific demand from a customer. We may provide installation and repair services with some of this equipment.

 Competition 
 Equipment Manufacturing and Sales  
 We compete with a number of other manufacturers of marine seismic, hydrographic and oceanographic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own. We generally compete for sales of equipment on the basis of (1) technical capability, (2) reliability, (3) price, (4) delivery terms and (5) service. 
Equipment Leasing  
 Our major competitors include the seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms, offer leases with purchase options and offer short term rentals of their products. In addition, some seismic contractors might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time. We face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing, but this competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide geographic presence as MII. We compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of (1) price, (2) delivery terms, (3) availability of desired equipment and (4) location of equipment. We believe that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provide a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies. 
 We compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners, including seismic data acquisition contractors, who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment. Some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own. 
 Suppliers 
 We obtain parts, components and services from a number of suppliers to our manufacturing operation. These suppliers are located in various geographic locations. No critical items are obtained on a sole-source basis. 
 We have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool. We acquire the majority of our seismic lease pool equipment from Sercel and Geospace. However, we also acquire lease pool equipment from a number of other suppliers. Management believes that our current relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory and that

  we will be able to make satisfactory alternative agreements in the event of interruption of supply. For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 45%, 53%, and 53%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the rental of products we acquired from Sercel. For additional information regarding the risk associated with our suppliers, see Item 1A  Risk Factors. 
Employees 
 As of January 31, 2017, we employed approximately 199 people full-time, none of whom were represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. 
Intellectual Property 
 The products designed, manufactured and sold by our Equipment Manufacturing and Sales segment utilize significant intellectual property that we have developed or have licensed from others. Our internally developed intellectual property consists of product designs and trade secrets. In connection with the acquisition of the Digishot and Sleeve Gun product lines from ION in May 2014, we acquired certain United States and foreign patents related to energy source controllers and other technology. We believe these acquired intellectual property rights will allow us to incorporate certain design features and functionality in future versions of our GunLink product line. We believe the pertinent patents to have a valid term through at least 2023. 
 In connection with the acquisition of Klein in December 2015, we acquired certain intellectual property consisting primarily of product designs and trade secrets. 
 We own intellectual property relating to the design and manufacture of heli-pickers. This intellectual property includes United States, Canadian, Australian and United Kingdom patents.

 We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to worker safety and health, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals and other materials used in our manufacturing processes or otherwise generated from our operations. We have established and implemented environmental procedures for the management of these chemicals and materials as well as the handling and recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits for air emissions and water discharges resulting from our manufacturing processes, impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection, result in capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges, and obligate us to use more stringent precautions for disposal of certain wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief. We may be subject to strict, joint and several liability as well as natural resource damages resulting from spills or releases of chemicals or other regulated materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by spills or releases that may affect them. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, remediate environmental contamination, and undertake measures to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be significant. 
 In addition, certain regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions address the manner in which certain hazardous materials, such as electric storage batteries, can be transported. These regulations may limit our ability, and that of our customers, to transport equipment necessary for seismic operations, particularly by air. These limitations may significantly increase the time and cost required to transport such equipment.

Index to Financial Statements
 The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. For instance, the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to climate-change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon-based fuels or decreasing the performance of oil or natural gas exploration or production activities by energy companies, could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the implementation of new or more restrictive regulatory initiatives in response to significant spills by oil and natural gas operators, such as occurred following the Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010, may delay or decrease the pace of exploration or production activities, which may result in a similar decrease in demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We are also subject to federal, state and foreign worker safety and health laws and regulations. These laws and regulations obligate us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and to provide this information to employees, state and legal governmental authorities and citizens. We do not believe that compliance with existing applicable environmental, worker safety and health laws and regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business; however, we cannot give any assurance that this will continue in the future.
