Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and delivers transformative therapies for unmet medical needs. Our team has a proven track record of successful drug development and commercialization. Our clinical pipeline includes treatments for immune and fibrotic diseases as well as immuno-oncology therapies. We expect to continue to progress our clinical candidates and have further clinical trial events throughout 2021. Below is a brief description of our clinical product candidates:
Immune and Fibrotic Diseases. We are developing oral small molecule inhibitors of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (“ROCK”) to treat immune and fibrotic diseases. Research by Kadmon and several academic institutions has demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK can regulate aberrant immune responses and fibrotic processes.
oBelumosudil. Belumosudil (KD025), our most advanced product candidate, is an orally administered, selective small molecule inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (“ROCK2”). A pivotal study of belumosudil is ongoing in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (“cGVHD”), a complication following hematopoietic cell transplantation (“HCT”) that can result in multi-organ inflammation and fibrosis. 
In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accepted the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for belumosudil for the treatment of patients with cGVHD. The FDA granted Priority Review for the NDA for belumosudil and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) target action date of May 30, 2021. The NDA is being reviewed under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review (“RTOR”) and Project Orbis pilot programs. 
According to the FDA, the RTOR pilot program aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. In addition, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for belumosudil for the treatment of patients with cGVHD after failure of two or more lines of systemic therapy as well as Orphan Drug Designation to belumosudil for the treatment of cGVHD. BTD is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). 
According to the FDA, Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. In October 2020 we filed a New Drug Submission (NDS) with Health Canada; a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with Swissmedic; and an MAA with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, for belumosudil in certain patients with cGVHD, under Project Orbis. In addition, in November 2020, we filed an MAA with the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for belumosudil in cGVHD under Project Orbis. Both the NDS and the Australian MAA have received priority review from the respective applicable agency. Participation in the RTOR and Project Orbis pilot programs does not guarantee or influence approvability of our NDA, NDS, SwissMedic MAA, Australian MAA or UK MAA for belumosudil in certain patients with cGVHD, which are subject to the standard benefit-risk evaluation by the FDA, and the applicable review standards of Health Canada, Swissmedic, MHRA and TGA, respectively, and we may not derive any benefit from inclusion in these programs, including, but not limited to, a more efficient review process. These programs are not formal regulatory pathways and may be changed, suspended or halted at any time.
In addition to cGVHD, we are developing belumosudil in for the treatment of systemic sclerosis (“SSc”), an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, fibrosis and vascular damage. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to belumosudil for the treatment of SSc. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 60-patient Phase 2 clinical trial (KD025-209) of belumosudil in diffuse cutaneous SSc, a subtype of SSc, is ongoing. In addition, we plan to initiate KD025-215, an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of belumosudil in up to 15 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, in 2021. KD025-215 is designed to quickly demonstrate the potential of belumosudil in SSc while the placebo-controlled trial is ongoing.

 



Immuno-oncology. We have a biologics research platform focused on the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics, specifically, IL-15-containing fusion proteins for the treatment of cancer.
oKD033. KD033 is an anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein and is the most advanced product candidate from our IL-15 platform. KD033 significantly inhibited tumor growth in many mouse syngeneic models, including PD-L1-expressing models that are resistant to approved immunotherapies. In these models, KD033 has demonstrated long-lasting responses through the induction of immune system memory. A Phase 1 clinical trial of KD033 in adults with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors is ongoing. 
Our Strategy
Our goal is to develop innovative therapies for significant unmet medical needs. Our key strategies to achieve this goal are listed below:
Advance belumosudil for the treatment of immune diseases. Our NDA has been accepted by the FDA for belumosudil for the treatment of cGVHD. As further discussed below, we recently announced positive results from the 12-month follow-up analysis of the trial. We are also conducting a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of belumosudil in systemic sclerosis and plan to initiate an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of belumosudil in systemic sclerosis in 2021.
Develop KD033 for the treatment of cancer. We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of KD033 in adults with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors.
Leverage our research platforms to develop new product candidates. In addition to belumosudil and KD033, we intend to use our small molecule and biologics research capabilities to develop new therapies in the areas of immune and fibrotic diseases and immuno-oncology.
Kadmon Pharmaceuticals is our wholly owned, fully integrated commercial operation. We do not currently depend on commercial revenues from Kadmon Pharmaceuticals to support our non-commercial operations. Our commercial infrastructure, including the regulatory, compliance, quality and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) teams, currently supports the development of our clinical-stage product candidates. We plan to leverage our commercial infrastructure to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
Our Clinical-Stage Pipeline
The following chart includes our clinical-stage product candidates. In addition, we continue to leverage our small molecule and biologics research capabilities to develop new therapies in the areas of immune and fibrotic diseases as well as immuno-oncology.

ROCK Inhibition for Immune and Fibrotic Diseases 
ROCK is an “on” switch in cells that regulates cell movement, shape, differentiation and function. Two isoforms exist: ROCK1 and ROCK2, and dysregulation of ROCK is implicated in many chronic diseases. Kadmon’s research has demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK can regulate aberrant immune responses and fibrotic processes. Kadmon is developing a ROCK2-selective inhibitor, belumosudil, for the treatment of immune diseases. 

 


Kadmon’s research has helped define the role of ROCK in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including immune and fibrotic diseases. Specifically, our research has demonstrated that belumosudil helps to resolve immune dysregulation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and increasing regulatory T (“Treg”) cells. 
ROCK is downstream of major pro-fibrotic mediators and regulates multiple fibrotic processes, including stress fiber formation, myofibroblast activation and pro-fibrotic gene transcription. Belumosudil has down-regulated key fibrotic processes in preclinical models, including with profibrotic gene transcription, stress fiber formation, myofibroblast activation and collagen deposition. In addition to belumosudil, Kadmon is developing KD045, a pan-ROCK inhibitor, for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. KD045 inhibited key fibrotic processes in multiple in vivo pharmacology models. IND-enabling activities are ongoing for KD045.
Belumosudil Clinical Program
To date, more than 550 subjects have been dosed with belumosudil for immune or fibrotic diseases or as healthy volunteers. Belumosudil has been well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity.
Belumosudil for the Treatment of Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease 
Medical Need: Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
cGVHD is a common complication that can occur following HCT. In cGVHD, transplanted immune cells (graft) attack the patient’s cells (host), leading to inflammation and fibrosis in multiple tissues, including skin, mouth, eye, joints, liver, lung, esophagus and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 14,000 patients in the United States are living with cGVHD.
Belumosudil in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
Belumosudil has demonstrated clinical activity and tolerability in an ongoing pivotal trial in patients with cGVHD who have received two or more prior lines of systemic therapy (ROCKstar; KD025-213) as well as in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory cGVHD with one to three prior lines of treatment for the disease (KD025-208). 
Ongoing Pivotal Trial of Belumosudil in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (ROCKstar)
ROCKstar (KD025-213) is an ongoing, open-label pivotal trial evaluating belumosudil in adults and adolescents with cGVHD who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Patients were randomized to receive belumosudil 200 mg QD or 200 mg BID (63 patients per arm). Either belumosudil dose may be considered by the FDA for registration. The primary endpoint is the ORR, defined as the percentage of patients who meet the 2014 National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) Consensus Conference overall response criteria of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). 
In December 2020, we announced positive results from the planned 12-month follow-up analysis of ROCKstar (KD025-213). The trial met the primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (“ORR”) at the interim analysis, which was conducted, as scheduled, two months after completion of enrollment. At the 12-month follow-up analysis, belumosudil achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful ORRs of 73% with 200 mg once daily (95% Confidence Interval (“CI”): 60%, 83%; p<0.0001) and 77% with belumosudil 200 mg twice daily (95% CI: 65%, 87%; p<0.0001). ORRs were consistent across key patient subgroups and complete responses were observed in all affected organ systems, including in organs with fibrotic disease. Responses were durable, with a median duration of response of 50 weeks; 60% of responders have maintained their responses for 20 weeks or longer. Clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in the Lee Symptom Scale (LSS) score, a quality-of-life measurement, was observed in 60% of patients. In addition, 64% of patients were able to reduce their corticosteroid dose, with 21% of patients completely discontinuing corticosteroid therapy. Belumosudil has been well tolerated and adverse events have been consistent with those expected in the cGVHD patient population. 
In November 2020, the FDA accepted the NDA for belumosudil for the treatment of patients with cGVHD. The FDA granted Priority Review for the NDA for belumosudil and assigned a PDUFA target action date of May 30, 2021. The NDA is being reviewed under the FDA's RTOR and Project Orbis pilot programs. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to belumosudil for the treatment of patients with cGVHD after failure of two or more lines of systemic therapy as well as Orphan Drug Designation to belumosudil for the treatment of cGVHD.

 


Ongoing Phase 2a Clinical Trial of Belumosudil in cGVHD (KD025-208)
KD025-208 is an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory cGVHD with one to three prior lines of treatment for the disease. Three cohorts of patients, (belumosudil 200 mg QD (n=17), belumosudil 200 mg BID (n=16) and belumosudil 400 mg QD (n=21)), were enrolled sequentially following a safety assessment of the previous cohort. Belumosudil achieved an ORR of approximately 65% across all three cohorts. Responses were observed across all affected organ systems, including in organs with fibrotic disease. Responses were durable, with a median duration of response of 35 weeks. Patients reported improvements in quality of life and were also able to reduce and/or completely discontinue doses of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. Pharmacodynamics data showed a decrease in Th17 cells and an increase in Treg cells during belumosudil treatment, consistent with belumosudil mechanism of action. Belumosudil was well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events and no apparent increased risk of infection. Forty-three percent (43%) of patients in the trial have remained on belumosudil for more than one year and 28% of patients have remained on belumosudil for more than one-and-a-half years as of February 19, 2020.
Belumosudil for the Treatment of Systemic Sclerosis
Medical Need: Systemic Sclerosis 
Systemic sclerosis (“SSc”) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes widespread microvascular damage and excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis is primarily cutaneous, affecting the hands, arms, and face. Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) is a more serious manifestation of the disease and is often rapidly progressive, not only involving the skin, but also involving internal organs. SSc affects 75,000 to 100,000 people in the United States, approximately 35% of whom have dcSSc. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of dcSSc. 
Ongoing Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Belumosudil in dcSSc (KD025-209)
We are conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of belumosudil in dcSSc, a disease in which belumosudil has demonstrated potential in preclinical models. Sixty patients are being randomized to receive belumosudil 200 mg QD, belumosudil 200 mg BID or placebo (20 patients per arm). The primary endpoint is the change in Combined Response Index for Systemic Sclerosis (“CRISS”) score, a measure of improvement in systemic sclerosis, at 24 weeks. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to belumosudil for the treatment of SSc.
Planned Open-Label Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Belumosudil in dcSSc (KD025-215)
In 2021, we expect to enroll the first patient in an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of belumosudil in dcSSc. Up to fifteen patients are being randomized to receive belumosudil 200 mg BID. The primary endpoint is the change in CRISS score, a measure of improvement in systemic sclerosis, at 24 weeks.
KD033 
We have an in-house novel phage display library able to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies against many protein targets. This platform is run by an experienced group of scientists with an outstanding antibody development track record. Prior to joining Kadmon, this team was involved in the development of multiple commercially successful antibodies including Erbitux (cetuximab) and Cyramza (ramucirumab). Our scientists are developing monoclonal antibodies as well as fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies that we believe represent the next generation of cancer immunotherapies.
Our most advanced candidate from the biologics platform, KD033, is a novel anti-PD-L1/IL-15 fusion protein designed to stimulate an immune response directed to the tumor microenvironment. IL-15 is a cytokine that expands key tumor-fighting immune cell types, including natural killer (NK), NKT cells and memory T cells without expanding immunosuppressive Treg cells. We believe targeting this activity will allow for robust and durable anti-tumor responses. KD033 is designed to direct IL-15 activity to the tumor microenvironment of PD-L1-expressing tumors to achieve a greater therapeutic window. 
Preclinical data demonstrated that a single dose of KD033 inhibited tumor growth across multiple in vivo syngeneic tumor models. KD033 induced a strong immune response with a single treatment, resulting in mice that remained tumor-free following several tumor re-challenges. Furthermore, KD033 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated synergistic activity, providing clinical rationale for administering KD033 in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors. KD033 has demonstrated significant tumor inhibition in murine models that are resistant to approved immunotherapies (PD-L1, PD-1 or CTLA-4 antibodies), suggesting that KD033 may deliver promising clinical outcomes in cancer patients resistant or refractory to immuno-oncology monotherapy. A Phase 1 clinical trial of KD033 in adults with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors is ongoing.

 


Other Clinical Programs 
Tesevatinib for the Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (KD019-211) 
Tesevatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (“ADPKD”), a genetic kidney disorder. To date, more than 300 individuals have received tesevatinib for the treatment of PKD or cancer, or as healthy volunteers.
Our randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of tesevatinib in ADPKD (KD019-211) is ongoing and has completed enrollment. The primary endpoint is change from baseline of the height-adjusted total kidney volume in patients with ADPKD treated with tesevatinib 50 mg QD compared to placebo at 24 months. 
Our Drug Discovery Platforms 
We have two drug discovery platforms that support our pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates: small molecules and biologics. We are developing novel therapies in the areas of immune and fibrotic diseases as well as immuno-oncology.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $65.4 million and $56.5 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. For further detail about our research and development activities, refer to the research and development sections in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sales and Marketing
Kadmon Pharmaceuticals is our wholly owned, fully integrated commercial operation. Although our commercial business generates revenue, we do not currently place significant value on our commercial operations from a revenue-generation standpoint. Until belumosudil is approved for marketing, if at all, revenues from such operations will not support our research and development efforts. We leverage our commercial infrastructure to support the development of our clinical-stage product candidates by providing quality assurance, compliance, regulatory and pharmacovigilance among other capabilities. We believe our commercial infrastructure will be most advantageous to us in the future, in connection with the anticipated commercialization of belumosudil and our pipeline product candidates, if approved. We are further developing our marketing, distribution, market access, patient support services and reimbursement capabilities in anticipation of potential FDA approval for belumosudil. Our intent is to commercialize belumosudil ourselves in the United States with a targeted customer-facing organization to call on treating specialists and payors. To that end, we have established a fully integrated healthcare-provider facing field force who will be responsible for generating awareness of belumosudil, if approved, as well as a team of account directors responsible for generating market access and establishing formulary positions post-approval.
Our commercial organization encompasses managed care and specialty pharmacy account directors, experienced regulatory, quality, compliance and CMC teams, strategic marketing experts and immune hematology managers, with long-standing relationships with key centers of excellence and leading physicians. The specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors through which we distribute our products are fully independent of Kadmon. We do not have any ownership interest in or affiliations with any specialty pharmacy or specialty distributor, nor do we consolidate the financial results of any specialty pharmacies or specialty distributors with our own.
Strategic Collaborations and License Agreements
Nano Terra, Inc. 
In April 2011, in connection with the acquisition of Surface Logix, Inc. (“SLx”) by Nano Terra, Inc. (“Nano Terra”), our subsidiary Kadmon Corporation entered into a joint venture with SLx through the formation of NT Life Sciences, LLC (“NT Life”), whereby Kadmon Corporation contributed $0.9 million at the date of formation in exchange for a 50.0% interest in NT Life. Contemporaneously with our entry into the joint venture, we entered into an exclusive sub-license agreement with NT Life and SLx, under which NT Life granted us rights to certain patents and know-how it licensed from SLx relating to belumosudil (KD025) (formerly SLx-2119). Under this agreement, NT Life granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license (under the patents and know how it licensed from SLx) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export certain products, including belumosudil. NT Life also granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable license under certain SLx platform technology to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export the products. The initial purpose of the joint venture with SLx was to develop assets licensed to us from SLx and to define the royalty obligations with respect to certain products not exclusively licensed to us. The joint venture is, however, currently inactive. We expect that the joint venture will become active in the future upon the commercialization of belumosudil, if approved.

 


We are the sublicensee of granted patents in the United States for belumosudil, as well as applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States, which claim belumosudil as a composition-of-matter, and use of belumosudil to treat certain diseases. The last-to-expire U.S. patent in this family has a term that ends in October 2029 based on a calculated PTA and without regard to any potential PTE, which could further extend the term by an additional five years.
In consideration for the rights granted to us by NT Life, we agreed to assume certain of Nano Terra’s payment obligations, which are limited to the royalty percentages discussed in this paragraph, under the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 8, 2011, by and among Nano Terra, NT Acquisition, Inc., SLx, and Dion Madsen, as the Stockholder Representative of SLx (the “Nano Terra Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to these obligations, we are required to pay to the Stockholder Representative and NT Life royalties on net sales in the amount of 5% and 10% respectively. As we own 50% of NT Life, the cumulative result of these obligations is that we will owe aggregate royalty payments totaling 9.75% on net sales of licensed products. Pursuant to the assumption of Nano Terra’s payment obligations, if we further assign or sublicense our rights to any licensed product to certain third parties, we are also required to pay to the Stockholder Representative a portion of any sublicensing revenue relating to such licensed product ranging from the low twenty percents to the low forty percents, subject to specified deductions and adjustments. We are also required to pay to NT Life any remaining sublicensing revenue after giving effect to the foregoing sublicense revenue payment to the Stockholder Representative.
Unless earlier terminated, our agreement with NT Life will, with respect to a licensed product, end on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the latest of (a) the expiration or invalidation of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right covering such licensed product in such country and (b) the expiration or termination of payment obligations with respect to such licensed product in such country under the Nano Terra Merger Agreement. The agreement will, with respect to the licensed SLx platform technology, end on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration or invalidation of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right covering such SLx platform technology. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon six months’ written notice to NT Life and if we provide such notice, NT Life may accelerate such termination upon thirty days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within a specified time period. NT Life may terminate the agreement if we challenge the licensed patents. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. The agreement shall terminate in the event we are dissolved.
In addition, the agreement shall terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis in the event such licensed product reverts to the Stockholder Representative because of a failure to satisfy the diligence requirements as set forth in the Nano Terra Merger Agreement. More specifically, pursuant to our sub-license agreement with NT Life and SLx, we agreed to assume certain of Nano Terra’s diligence obligations under the Nano Terra Merger Agreement such that we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed products, including belumosudil. With respect to belumosudil, our diligence obligations do not expire until the completion of a certain specified Phase 2 clinical trial of belumosudil in oncology. If, prior to the expiration of our diligence obligations, we fail to comply with such diligence obligations for any licensed product, including belumosudil, the Stockholder Representative may require Nano Terra to assign all assets of SLx, including intellectual property, relating to such licensed product to an entity designated by such Stockholder Representative, subject to Nano Terra’s and our rights to contest such assignment. If such an assignment takes place, our sublicense rights to such intellectual property for such licensed product will terminate. 
If the agreement is terminated, among other things, we will be required to cease all development and commercialization of the licensed products, including belumosudil, all licenses granted to us will terminate and we are obligated to grant NT Life a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, exclusive license under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by us that relate to the licensed products to develop and commercialize such licensed products.
Dyax Corp. (acquired by Shire Plc in January 2016 and acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd in 2018)
In July 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Dyax Corp. (“Dyax”) for the rights to use the Dyax Antibody Libraries, Dyax Materials and Dyax Know-How (collectively “Dyax Property”). The agreement terminated on September 22, 2015, but we had a right to a commercial license of any research target within two years of expiration of the agreement. We exercised this right to a commercial license of two targets in September 2017, one of which is KD033, resulting in a license fee payable to Shire Plc of $1.5 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the third quarter of 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, we also recorded $1.5 million and as research and development expense during each of the fourth quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, related to development milestones we met during those quarters.

 


BioNova Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
In November 2019, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with BioNova Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“BioNova”) to form a joint venture to exclusively develop and commercialize belumosudil (KD025), the Company’s lead product candidate, for the treatment of graft-versus-host-disease (“GVHD”) in the People’s Republic of China. The joint venture was entered into through the creation of BK Pharmaceuticals Limited (“BK Pharma”), whereby the Company entered into a royalty-bearing exclusive license agreement with BK Pharma and BioNova in exchange for a 20% interest in BK Pharma. BK Pharma is domiciled in Hong Kong with shared oversight between the Company and BioNova. 
Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $4.0 million in December 2019 and is eligible to receive an additional $41.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified events over the term of the agreement. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive double-digit percentage royalty payments on sales of belumosudil for GVHD in China. 
The Company recognized $4.0 million in license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. No other milestone or royalty revenues have been earned as of December 31, 2020. 
Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd 

In December 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd (“Meiji”), a Tokyo-based wholly owned subsidiary of Meiji Holdings Co., Ltd., to form a joint venture to exclusively develop and commercialize belumosudil in Japan and certain other Asian countries. The joint venture was entered into through the creation of Romeck Pharma, LLC (“Romeck”), whereby the Company entered into a royalty-bearing exclusive license agreement with Romeck and Meiji in exchange for a 50% interest in Romeck. Romeck is domiciled in Japan with shared oversight between the Company and Meiji. 
Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $6.0 million in January 2020 and is eligible to receive an additional $23.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified events over the term of the agreement. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive double-digit percentage royalty payments on sales of belumosudil for GVHD in Japan. 
The Company recognized $6.0 million in license revenue in the first quarter of 2020 upon completion of the single combined performance obligation. No other milestone or royalty revenues have been earned as of December 31, 2020

Manufacturing and Supply
We currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates. We currently outsource to a limited number of external service providers the production of all active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), drug substances and drug products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates. We do not have long-term agreements with these third parties. We have framework agreements with most of our external service providers, under which they generally provide services to us on a short-term, project-by-project basis. We typically have long-term relationships with our manufacturing and supply chain partners for our commercial products.
Currently, our drug substance or API raw materials for our product candidates can be supplied by multiple source suppliers. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. The contract manufacturing organizations that we use to manufacture our product are obligated to operate under current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (cGMP) conditions.
Competition
We compete directly with companies that focus on cGVHD, systemic sclerosis and IL-15 based therapies for cancer, and companies dedicating their resources to novel forms of therapies for these indications. We also face competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and other various public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies in these areas, we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

 


Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if our product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then.
There are a number of currently marketed therapies and products in late-stage clinical development to treat cGVHD and systemic sclerosis, including:

cGVHD | Systemic Sclerosis 
Imbruvica (ibrutinib) | Ofev (nintedanib) 
Jakafi (ruxolitinib) | Mycophenolate mofetil
Corticosteroids | Cyclosporine 
Calcineurin inhibitors | 

Certain products in development may provide efficacy, safety, dosing convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Government Regulation
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture (including manufacturing changes), quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and in the case of biologics, also the Public Health Service Act, and various implementing regulations. Most biological products meet the FDCA’s definition of “drug” and are subject to FDA drug requirements, supplemented by biologics requirements.
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;

 



performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to “good clinical practices” (“GCP”) regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use;
preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”);
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Once a pharmaceutical or biological product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. When a sponsor wants to proceed to test the product candidate in humans, it must submit an IND in order to conduct clinical trials.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
‎



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
United States Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, or a BLA for a biological drug product, requesting approval to market the product.
The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. For FDA fiscal year 2020 the application fee for an application with clinical data was $2,942,965. Sponsors are also subject to a prescription drug program fee. For fiscal 2020, the prescription drug program fee was $325,424.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or BLA applications (or supplements to applications) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral.
In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”), within sixty days of an End-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies, and/or other clinical development programs.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.

 


The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. For biologics, the applicant must demonstrate that the product is safe, pure, and potent (interpreted to include effectiveness), and that the facilities designed for its production meet standards to ensure the product will consistently be safe, pure, and potent.
The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA only if the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture processing, packing, and testing of the product are adequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. Drug cGMPs are established in 21 C.F.R. Parts 210 and 211, and biologic drug products must meet the drug standards as well as the supplemental requirements in 21 C.F.R. Part 600 et seq.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA often will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured.
The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure that clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
After the FDA’s evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

 


Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, Priority Review, accelerated approval, and BTD, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
The FDA may give a Priority Review designation to drugs intended to treat serious conditions that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A Priority Review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the "filing" date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for NME, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track Designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a Priority Review.
In addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or other clinical endpoint and to submit promotional materials for preapproval and pre-use review. In addition, the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies may also be eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
In addition, the FDA may review applications under RTOR, which, according to the FDA, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. Drugs considered for review under RTOR must be likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted BTD for the same or other indications, and must have straight-forward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted. RTOR allows the FDA to review much of the data earlier, before the applicant formally submits the complete application. This analysis of the pre-submission package gives the FDA and applicants an early opportunity to address data quality and potential review issues and allows the FDA to provide early feedback regarding the most effective way to analyze data to properly address key regulatory questions.
Project Orbis is an initiative of the FDA's OCE and, according to the FDA, provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of the expedited review programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track Designation, Priority Review, accelerated approval, BTD, RTOR, and Project Orbis do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.

 


Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations, and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription drugs and biologics is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of the products and product samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidances and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

 


Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA/BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for Patent Term Extensions, defined as the length of the regulatory review of products covered by our granted patents, for some of our currently owned or licensed applications and patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates. Such extensions will depend on the length of the regulatory review; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.
With respect to biologics, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA) signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars, although there has been significant litigation and questions over interpretation of such guidelines.
Biosimilarity, which requires that the product be “highly similar” and there be no clinically significant differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.

 


Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs (including biological drug products) intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee.
During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care, or if the manufacturer of the product with orphan exclusivity is not able to assure sufficient quantities of the product. “Same drug” means a drug that contains the same identity of the active moiety if it is a drug composed of small molecules, or of the principal molecular structural features if it is composed of macromolecules and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a biologic or drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third-party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific biologics and drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved biologics or drugs for a particular indication, or place biologics and drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor.

 


Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any currently marketed products and product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers, and our sales, marketing and educational activities, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations (at the federal and state level) that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval.
In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that govern certain of our operations include the following, but are not limited to:
a)federal and state laws relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and any other federal healthcare program;
b)federal and state laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)), the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729 et seq.), the False Statements Statute, (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(a)), the Exclusion Laws (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7), the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7h), the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (21 U.S.C. § 351 et seq.), the Anti-Inducement Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a(a)(5)), the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a) and criminal laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. §§ 286, 287 and 1001, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, (Pub.L. 104-191); 
c)state laws relating to Medicaid or any other state healthcare or health insurance programs; 
d)federal or state laws relating to billing or claims for reimbursement submitted to any third party payor, employer or similar entity, or patient; 
e)any other federal or state laws relating to fraudulent, abusive or unlawful practices connected in any way with the provision or marketing of healthcare items or services, including laws relating to the billing or submitting of claims for reimbursement for any items or services reimbursable under any state, federal or other governmental healthcare or health insurance program or any private payor; and
f)federal and state laws relating to health information privacy and security, including HIPAA, and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and any regulations promulgated thereunder.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

 


Foreign Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 127 people, including 70 in research and development, 27 in commercial operations and 30 in a general and administrative capacity, including executive officers. We anticipate that the number of employees will grow as we continue to develop our product candidates. In addition, we utilize and will continue to utilize temporary employees and consultants, clinical research organizations and third parties to perform certain activities, such as our pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, manufacturing and regulatory functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We aspire to create healthier futures for patients and accelerate business results by inspiring the best and brightest talent across all dimensions of diversity to perform at their full potential. We challenge our people to make a difference by doing work that positively impacts our business, empowering them to lead, and letting them know that the Company is behind each of them as they contribute to our success. We enable our people, creating a culture where employees can learn, grow, experiment, and freely express ideas as we collectively seek to enhance long-term shareholder value. We strive to ensure our people are valued and included, treating them with respect, recognizing their unique knowledge and skills, supporting their work/life balance with flexibility, and providing competitive compensation and benefits, all in keeping with the strong performance we expect even in a challenging environment.
As a small, innovative company with developing commercialization plans and strategies, specifically with respect to our most advanced product candidate Belumosudil (KD025), we expect to expand our employee base for primarily managerial, operational, sales and marketing positions. We are committed to rewarding and supporting our employees in order to continue to attract and retain top talent. We believe this commitment supports our core strategy of creating and advancing a high-quality product pipeline. Employee engagement, commitment, and achievements are key drivers of pipeline success and therefore our long-term performance in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. The primary underpinning of our pay philosophy is to award equity-based pay to all eligible employees to ensure that when we deliver for patients and for shareholders, everyone shares in the upside growth. Our practice, therefore, has been to award initial equity grants to all new hires, in addition to our comprehensive annual equity program. Total employee compensation packages include market-competitive pay (with the opportunity to receive above-market rewards), broad-based grants of equity-based awards, healthcare benefits, retirement savings options, and matching contributions.
The health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees. For example, we have taken significant steps to protect our workforce including but not limited to, working remotely, and implementing social distancing protocols consistent with guidelines issued by federal, state, and local law.

Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2021, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (3) the date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. In addition, a company may qualify as a non-accelerated filer if it has (1) annual revenues of less than $100 million in the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and (2) a public float of less than $700 million as of the last business day of its second fiscal quarter.
For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We are choosing to “opt out” of the extended transition periods available under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and intend to take advantage of the other reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
