GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
The gaming and lottery industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation that customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
 
While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

The company did participate in the Fantini virtual tradeshow and the Global Gaming Virtual Expo (G2E).  The Company holds licenses in Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada and pending in California, which allows the Company to pursue sales in these territories.

On April 14, 2020, the Company entered into a Promissory Note with Alerus Financial, N.A.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to impact the economy and will likely continue to adversely affect our business. As of the date of this filing, uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the pandemic. The company continues to operate while adhering to social distancing and state orders. Some of our customers have and will temporarily close or will be operating at a diminished capacity which may negatively impact revenue. The pandemic may shift industry demand for installing and replacing existing casino management systems, impact sales and gross margins in the future, limit our ability to secure products we sell due to supplier and manufacturer shortages, limit the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic and local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home, limit the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers, limit the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services, and limit the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.
 
As described above, in April 2020 we applied and were approved for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan through the Small Business Administration. This loan was forgiven on December 21, 2020.
 
To ensure that our business can continue to operate during this uncertain time, in February 2021 we applied and were approved for a second draw of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan through the Small Business Administration. This loan will allow us to continue to employ all existing employees to service our client base.
 
With respect to liquidity, we continue to evaluate and take actions to reduce costs and spending across our organization. This includes reducing hiring activities, adjusting pay programs, and limiting discretionary spending.
 
While we are unable to predict the nature, scope or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
