ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History and Organization
We are a mining and minerals production and exploration company focused on precious and base metals in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Colorado in 1979. We own 100% of the Black Fox mine and Stock mill in Ontario, Canada, a 100% interest in the Gold Bar mine in Nevada, 100% of the formerly-producing El Gallo Project in Sinaloa, Mexico, and a 49% interest in MSC, the owner and operator of the San José mine in Santa Cruz, Argentina. MSC is controlled by the majority owner of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc (“Hochschild”). Since we own less than a 50% interest in MSC, we account for our interest as an unconsolidated subsidiary using the equity method of accounting. In addition to our operating properties, we hold interests in advanced-stage and exploration-stage properties and projects in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, including the Los Azules (“Los Azules”) copper project in Argentina. 
Our commencement of Canadian operations in 2017 was facilitated by the acquisition of Lexam VG Gold Inc. (“Lexam”) in April 2017 and the acquisition of the Black Fox mine and Stock mill in October 2017.  These two acquisitions provided us an operating mine, mill and significant land interests in the historic Timmins mining district of Ontario.  
Our 100% owned Gold Bar mine in Nevada poured its first gold ingot on February 16, 2019 and achieved commercial production on May 23, 2019. Construction activities started in late 2017 following the receipt of the final permit on November 8, 2017. At the El Gallo Project, mining and crushing activities ceased during the second quarter of 2018, with production activities since that time limited to residual leaching.
Our objective is to increase shareholder value through the exploration for and economic extraction of gold, silver and other valuable minerals. Other than the San José mine in Argentina, we generally conduct our activities as the sole operator, but we may enter into arrangements with other companies through joint venture or similar agreements in an effort to achieve our strategic objectives. We hold our mineral property interests and operate our business through various subsidiary companies, each of which is owned directly, or indirectly, by us.
Our principal executive office is located at 150 King Street West, Suite 2800, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 1J9 and our telephone number is (866) 441-0690. We also maintain offices in Elko, Nevada (U.S.), Matheson, Canada, Guamuchil, Mexico, and San Juan, Argentina. Our website is www.mcewenmining.com. We make available at no cost our periodic reports including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and news releases and certain of our corporate governance documents, including our Code of Ethics, on our website. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “MUX”.

Segment Information
Our operating segments include USA, Canada, Mexico, MSC and Los Azules. Financial information for each of our reportable segments can be found under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, Operating Segment Reporting. 
Products
The end product at our gold and silver operations is either in the form of doré or concentrate. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold and silver but also containing other impurity metals. Doré is sent to third party refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold and 99.9% silver. Ore concentrate, or simply concentrate, is raw mineralized material that has been ground finely to a powdery product from which gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. Concentrate, as well as slag and fine carbons (by-products of the gold production process), are sent to third party smelters for further recovery of gold and silver.
​

During 2020, production from the Gold Bar mine consisted of 100% doré, the production at the Black Fox mine was 99% doré and 1% slag and fine carbon and from the El Gallo Project approximately 97% doré and 3% slag and fine carbon. Production from the San José mine consisted of approximately 44% doré and 56% concentrate. 
​
During 2020, we reported the following consolidated production attributable to us:
​

Total Production | ​ | 92,102 | ​ | 2,020,069 | ​ | 114,843 


(1) | Calculated using an average silver to gold ratio of 86:1 at the 100% owned operations and a ratio of 89:1 at the San José mine. With a ratio of 86:1, gold equivalent ounces at the San José mine amount to 55,250. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gold and silver bullion obtained from the doré produced in USA, Canada, Mexico and the San José mine is sold at the prevailing spot market price. Concentrates produced by the San José mine are provisionally priced, whereby the selling price is subject to final adjustments at the end of a period ranging from 30 to 90 days after delivery to the customer. The final price is based on the market price at the relevant quotation period stipulated in the contract. Due to the time elapsed between shipment and the final settlement with the buyer, MSC estimates the prices at which sales of metals will be settled. At the end of each financial reporting period, previously recorded provisional sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices based on relevant forward market prices until final settlement with the buyer.
During 2020, revenues from gold and silver sales were $48.9 million for the Gold Bar mine, $41.4 million for the Black Fox mine, $14.5 million for the El Gallo Project, and $107.4 million for the San José mine on a 49% basis. Revenue from the San José mine is not included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) as we use the equity method of accounting for MSC. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding production and operating results for our properties, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Investments and Note 10, Investment in Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (“MSC”) – San José Mine for additional information regarding the equity method of accounting.
Like all metal producers, our operations are affected by fluctuations in metal prices. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily London P.M. Fix prices per ounce for gold and London Fix prices per ounce for silver over the past three years and 2021 to the most recent practical date on the London Bullion Market:

​
On March 10, 2021, the London P.M. Fix for gold was $1,716 per ounce and the London fix for silver was $25.65 per ounce.
Mineralized Material Processing Methods
Gold and silver are extracted from mineralized material by either milling or heap leaching depending on, among other things, the amount of gold and silver contained in the material, whether the material is naturally oxidized or not, and the amenability of the material to treatment. At the Gold Bar mine and the El Gallo Project, both open pit operations, the mineralized material is processed using heap leaching methods. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed, oxidized material on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve and leach the gold and silver. The gold and silver-bearing solution is then collected and processed into doré bars.

At Black Fox, mineralized material from the underground mine is transported to the mill site and fed to the mill’s crushing circuit. Following additional processing and refining, the operation produces doré bars.
At San José, mineralized material from the underground mine is processed at a mill site, producing a concentrate and doré product.
Hedging Activities
Our strategy is to provide shareholders with exposure to gold and silver prices by selling our gold and silver ounces at spot market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold or silver sales. We may, however, from time to time, manage certain risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies using the derivatives market. 
Gold and Silver Reserves
We have established gold and/or silver reserves at three of our properties: Gold Bar, Black Fox and San José. In 2020, through consultations with field experts, we completed work around the Gold Bar mineral reserve to revise the previous estimate. The work included drilling and metallurgical testing, geological and structural modelling and a 110,500 feet (33,700 m) drill program. On January 7, 2021, we announced the updated Indicated Resource and Probable Reserve Estimates of the Gold Bar mine and subsequently filed the 43-101 Technical Report on February 22, 2021.
The following table summarizes the estimated portion of proven and probable gold and silver reserves attributable to us for the Gold Bar mine, the Black Fox mine and San José mine as of December 31, 2020:

Competitive Business Conditions
We compete with many companies in the mining and mineral exploration and production industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel, and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim-staking, lease, or acquisition in the United States, Canada, Mexico, or Argentina, and other areas where we may conduct our mining or exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have significantly greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas which would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources.

5




Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties, but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such exploration and development. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious and base metals but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world-wide basis. Such competition may result in not only our company being unable to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
General Government Regulations
In the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities and concessions granted under contracts with the host government, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. The applicable laws and regulations applicable to us include but are not limited to:

● | mineral concession rights;
--+---------------------------


● | surface rights;
--+----------------


● | water rights;
--+--------------


● | mining royalties;
--+------------------


● | environmental laws;
--+--------------------


● | mining permits;
--+----------------


● | mining and income taxes;
--+-------------------------


● | health and safety laws and regulations;
--+----------------------------------------


● | labor laws and regulations; and
--+--------------------------------


● | export regulations.
--+--------------------

We believe that all of our properties are operated in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations.
Reclamation Obligations
Under applicable laws in the jurisdictions where our properties are located, we are required to reclaim disturbances caused by our mining activities. Accordingly, we have recorded estimates in our financial statements for our reclamation obligations, in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”) the most significant of which are related to our properties in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Estimated future reclamation costs are based primarily on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, we accrued $34.0 million for reclamation costs relating to currently developed and producing properties. These amounts are included in Asset Retirement Obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
U.S. Environmental Laws
We are subject to extensive environmental regulation under the laws of the U.S. and Nevada, the state where our U.S. operations are conducted. For example, certain mining wastes from the extraction and processing of ores would be considered hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state law equivalents, but we are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste. If our mine wastes were treated as hazardous waste under RCRA or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as “Superfund” sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state law equivalents for cleanup, significant expenditures could be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities, for other remediation expenditures, or for natural resource damages. Under CERCLA, any present or past owners or operators of a Superfund site generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owners or operators may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our operations, tailings, and waste disposal areas, as well as upon mine closure under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including, without limitation, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and state law equivalents.

We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Future changes in U.S. federal or state laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon us and our results of operations.
Foreign Government Regulations
Canada, where the Black Fox mine, Stock mill and other exploration and development projects are located, and Mexico, where the El Gallo Project and Fenix Project are located, have both adopted laws and guidelines for environmental permitting that are similar to those in effect in the U.S. The permitting process requires a thorough study to determine the baseline condition of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of exploration and mining operation activities. We have received all permits required to operate our current activities in Canada and Mexico and have received all permits necessary for the exploration activities being conducted at our other non-U.S. properties.
Customers
Production from Gold Bar, Black Fox, and the El Gallo Project is sold as refined metal on the spot market or doré under the terms set out in doré purchase agreements. 
We have doré purchase agreements with Canadian financial institutions, Asahi Refining (“Asahi”), our refiner, and with metals trading companies. Under the terms of our doré purchase agreements, we have the option to sell approximately 90% of the gold and silver contained in doré bars produced at Gold Bar, Black Fox and the El Gallo Project prior to the completion of refining. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 95% of our consolidated sales were made to The Bank of Nova Scotia and Asahi, with 34% of the sales made through the doré purchase agreement. 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, 90% of total sales from the San José mine were made to three companies: Aurubis AG, a Germany company, accounted for 21% of that amount, Argo-Heraeus, a Swiss company, accounted for 21% of such amount and LS Nikko Copper Inc., a South Korean company, accounted for 48% of that amount. MSC has sales agreements with each of these purchasers. 
In the event that our customer relationships or MSC’s customer relationships were interrupted for any reason, we believe that we or MSC could locate other purchasers for our products. However, any interruption may temporarily disrupt the sale of our products and may affect our operating results. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 377 employees including 83 in the United States, 24 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 166 in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, 98 employees based in Mexico, and 6 in Argentina. All of our employees based in Toronto work in an executive, technical or administrative position, while our employees in the United States, Timmins, Mexico, and Argentina include management, laborers, craftsmen, mining, geology and environmental specialists, information technologists, and various other support roles. As of December 31, 2020, MSC had 1,431 employees in Argentina.
A portion of our employees in Mexico are covered by union labor contracts with whom we believe we have good relations. We also frequently engage independent contractors in connection with certain administrative matters and the exploration of our properties, such as drillers, geophysicists, geologists, and other specialty technical disciplines.
​
For Canada and United States, we also engage independent contractors for technical and professional expertise as well as extractive and exploration activities such as drilling, geophysics, hauling and crushing.
