Item 1. Business
Business of Company
 
We were incorporated on January 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our principal executive offices are located at 125 Cambridge Park Drive, Suite 301, Cambridge, MA 02140. Our telephone number is +1 (617) 430-5222. Our fiscal year end is March 31.
 
On March 30, 2017, our name was changed from Luckycom Inc. to Luckycom Pharmaceuticals Inc. and again on April 11, 2018, our name was changed to Luckwel Pharmaceuticals Inc. In connection with the most recent name change, on April 13, 2018, our common stock began trading on the OTC Pink under its new ticker symbol “LWEL” and ceased trading under the ticker symbol “LCOM”. On January 15, 2021 we increased the number of our authorized shares from 200,000,000 to 500,000,000.
 
As of March 31, 2021 we were still a shell company and had not begun operations. We have no source of revenue and need additional cash resources to maintain the operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. We are presently dependent on our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kingrich Lee to either provide us funding for our daily operation and expenses, including professional fee and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so, or to spearhead financing efforts with third parties.
 
We require additional funds to continue operations and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any financings in the future and/or on terms that will be acceptable. Our priority, should we receive such additional funds, is to pay our legal, accounting and other fees associated with our Company and our filing obligations under United States federal securities laws, as well as to pay our other accounts payable generated in the ordinary course of our business.
 
Once these costs are accounted for, we will focus on the following activities:
 

● | Continue to work to establish a management team to work on establishing pharmaceutical operations in the Boston area. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue intellectual property registration work for drug candidates. 
● | Engage a Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or equivalent to prepare for pre-IND meetings, technical preparation, and preclinical preparation of potential drug development candidates. 

 
Any failure to raise money will have the effect of delaying the timeframes in the business plan as set forth above, and we may have to push back the dates of such activities.
 
Going Concern
 
We were still a shell company and had not yet begun operations as of March 31, 2021. Although management has taken recent steps to develop the Company, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in doing so. We have no source of revenue and need additional cash resources to maintain the operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. We are presently dependent on our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kingrich Lee, to either provide us funding for our daily operation and expenses, including professional fee and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so, or to spearhead financing efforts with third parties.

As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we have no source of revenue and need additional cash resources to maintain our operations. As of March 31, 2021 we had current assets of $46,681, liabilities totaling $490,949, had incurred losses since inception of $3,663,786, and had not yet received any revenue from sales of products or services. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. We are presently dependent on our controlling shareholder to provide us funding for our daily operation and expenses, including professional fees and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so.
 
Any failure to raise additional funds will have the effect of delaying the timeframes as described in our business plan as set forth above, and we may have to push back the dates or modify the scope of such planned activities.
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the global novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. As we were still a shell company on March 31, 2021, our operations have not been significantly impacted financially by the COVID-19 outbreak other than to delay our plans to develop the business and raise required funds to develop the Company beyond a shell and commence planned operations. We cannot at this time predict the specific extent, duration, or full impact that the COVID-19 outbreak will have on our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital to finance future planned operations.
 
Management has been taking steps to improve the financial position of the Company. In January 2021, we sold 300,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.40 per share for net proceeds of $120,000. In February 2021, $1,200,000 of Company liabilities owed to Mr. Kingrich Lee were converted into 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.40 per share. Subsequent to 2020 fiscal year end, in April 2021, the Company sold 300,000 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $0.40 per share for total gross proceeds of $120,000. In May 2021, the Company sold 187,500 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $0.40 per share for total gross proceeds of $75,000.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In May 2018, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property Sale and Purchase Agreement with Luckwel Asia Limited (the “Seller”, formerly known as Essential Choice Ventures Ltd), an entity under common control of Mr. Kingrich Lee to purchase the intellectual property rights to five drugs, comprising three generic medicines used to treat hypertension and high cholesterol and two advanced drug candidates - KL008 for treatment of hypertension and KL009 for treatment of high cholesterol in various stages of being developed and manufactured.
 
On February 5, 2021, Mr. Kingrich Lee, our Chief Executive Officer executed a Deed of Gift to irrevocably and unconditionally give, transfer, and assign, by way of gift, without limitations or restrictions, to us all of his right, title and interest in or arising from the following drug programs:
 

Program Code | Patent No. | Filing Date | Description

On March 19, 2021, Mr. Lee executed another Deed of Gift to irrevocably and unconditionally give, transfer and assign, by way of gift, without limitation or restriction, to us all of his right, title and interest in or arising from the following drug programs:
 

Program Code | Description 
-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KL-2118 | Candidate drug to be developed into orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) to treat Type 2 diabetes. 
KL-2119 | Candidate drug to be developed into an oral formulation treatment of HIV 
KL-2120 | Candidate drug to be developed into a liquid injection for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Sales and Marketing
 
Given our current stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company.
Competition
 
The industry we are in is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our products are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these competitor companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products).
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021 and as of the date of this filing, we do not have any employees, other than Mr. Kingrich Lee.
