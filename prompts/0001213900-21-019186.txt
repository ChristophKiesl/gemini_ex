Recent History
 
In January 2019, Mr. Yongquan Bi, a director and a substantial stockholder of the Company, together with a group of investors whose combined holdings constituted a majority of the voting rights in our company, delivered a written consent to the Company’s registered office. The written consent modified the composition of the Board of Directors and Mr. Yongquan Bi was subsequently appointed as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. In October 2019, Mr. Yongquan Bi resigned from the office of the Chief Executive Officer and President and Mr. Tiewei Song succeeded him as Chief Executive Officer and President.
The Boqi Zhengji Acquisition and Subsequent Disposition 
 
On October 14, 2019, as the initial step in our shift of focus from the energy sector to the healthcare business, we acquired Boqi Zhengji, the operator of a pharmacy chain business in the PRC, by purchasing 100% of the equity interests of Lasting, Boqi Zhengji’s parent company. Lasting, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Pukung, and Xinrongxin, owned all the ownership interests in Boqi Zhengji. Lasting, Pukung, Xinrongxin and Boqi Zhengji are hereinafter referenced as the “Boqi Zhengji Group”. The purchase price for the Boqi Zhengji consisted of RMB 40 million (approximately $5,655,709) and 1.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The 1.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock were issued to the sellers in October 2019. The cash consideration, which was subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Boqi Zhengji, measured by its pharmacy club member headcount and gross profit in 2020, was not payable until 2021.
 
Shortly after the acquisition, the business of Boqi Zhengji was severely impacted by the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19, and its revenues plummeted. On December 11, 2020, we entered into a Termination and Release Agreement (the “Release Agreement”) with the four individuals who sold Boqi Zhengji to us. We and the sellers confirmed that Boqi Zhengji’s performance targets as stipulated in the Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 11, 2019 (as amended on February 6, 2020, the “Boqi SPA”) would not be met, and therefore the sellers would not be eligible to receive the contingent RMB 40 million cash consideration or any other additional payment.
 
On December 11, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Boqi Zhengji to a third-party in consideration of $1,700,000 to be paid in cash at the closing. While the cash consideration was received on December 18, 2020, the official recognition of the closing was not received until February 2, 2021.

The Guanzan Acquisition
 
On February 1, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Guanzan, a company engaged in the distribution of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, based in Chongqing, the largest city in Southwest region of the PRC. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Guanzan and its subsidiary, Shude, (together the “Guanzan Group”), for RMB 100,000,000 (approximately $14,285,714) to be paid by the issuance of 950,000 shares of our common stock and the cash payment of RMB 80,000,000 (approximately $11,428,571). On March 18, 2020, we closed the Guanzan acquisition by delivering 950,000 shares of our common stock. The cash consideration, was subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Guanzan in 2020 and 2021.
 
The rationale for the Guanzan Acquisition was to further expand into the healthcare field by acquiring a medical devices and pharmaceuticals distribution business, in line with our expansion strategy which focuses on deeper penetration of the healthcare market in the Southwest region of China and achieving a wider footprint in the PRC. At the time of the acquisition, Guanzan had strong sales capabilities in Chongqing, the largest city in the Southwest region of the PRC.
 
On November 20, 2020, the parties to the Guanzan acquisition agreement entered into a Prepayment and Amendment Agreement (the “Prepayment Agreement”) in light of Guanzan’s performance during the period from March 18, 2020 to September 30, 2020, providing for the prepayment of RMB 20,000,000 of the contingent cash consideration in the form of shares of our common stock valued at $3.00 per share. On November 30, 2020, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock as the prepayment.
 
The NF Group disposition 
 
In late 2019, we committed to a plan to dispose of our legacy energy business, NF Investment and its subsidiaries (the “NF Group”), in order to focus on our healthcare business. On March 31, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell the NF Group for $10 million to be paid in cash at the closing. The transaction closed on June 23, 2020, at which time we received $10 million.
 
The Guoyitang Acquisition 
 
On December 9, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Chongqing Guoyitang Hospital (“Guoyitang”), the owner and operator of a private general hospital in Chongqing City, a city in Southwest China, with 50 hospital beds and 98 employees, including 14 doctors, 28 nurses, 43 other medical staff and 13 non-medical staff. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Guoyitang for RMB 100,000,000 (approximately $15,325,905) to be paid by the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and the payment of RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9,195,543) in cash. The acquisition closed on February 2, 2021, at which time 2,000,000 shares of our common stock were delivered to the sellers. The cash consideration of RMB 60,000,000 (approximately $9,195,543) was paid in December 2020. The balance of the purchase price of RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,097,560) is subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Guoyitang in 2021 and 2022.
The Zhongshan Acquisition
 
On December 15, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Chaohu Zhongshan Minimally Invasive Hospital (“Zhongshan”), a private hospital in the Southeast region of China with 160 hospital beds and 95 employees, including 20 doctors, 48 nurses, 10 other medical staff and 17 non-medical staff. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Zhongshan for RMB 120,000,000 (approximately $18,348,623), to be paid by the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock and the payment of RMB 80,000,000 in cash. The transaction closed on February 5, 2021 when 100% ownership of Zhongshan was transferred to the Company. The cash consideration of RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,116,207) was paid to the seller in December 2020. On February 12, 2021, we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock valued at RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,116,207) to the seller as part of the consideration. The balance of the purchase price in the amount of RMB 40,000,000 (approximately $6,116,207) will be paid subject to post-closing adjustments based on the performance of Zhongshan in 2021 and 2022.
 
We may pay the outstanding consideration for the Guanzan, Guoyitang and Zhongshan acquisitions to the extent payable: (i) in cash from funds to be raised from the sale of equity (to the extent possible) or (ii) through the issuance of our common stock. If we elect to issue shares of our common stock in consideration for the balance of the purchase for the three acquisitions, we may be required to seek stockholder approval of such issuances prior to issuing such shares.

Business Description
 
Subsequent to our disposition of the NF Group in March 2020, we have been engaged in both the retail and wholesale distribution of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products in the PRC. We have recently acquired two hospitals in Southwest China as our initial steps in our effort to establish a nationwide chain of hospitals specializing in obstetrics and gynecology.
Strategy
 
Our strategy is to build a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem, centering on online and offline healthcare products and services, including retail and wholesale sales of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and hospital services. We intend to expand through both organic growth and acquisitions. 
Corporate Organization
 
The structure of our corporate organization is as follows:
 

Wholesale Sales of Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals
 
We acquired Guanzan on March 18, 2020 in an effort to further expand our healthcare operations by acquiring a medical devices and pharmaceuticals distribution business. The acquisition was is in line with our expansion strategy, which focuses on deeper penetration of the healthcare market in the Southwest region of the PRC and gaining a wider footprint in the region.
 
Our wholesale medical devices and pharmaceuticals business is operated by the Guanzan Group in Chongqing, the largest city in Southwestern PRC. Guanzan Group is engaged in the distribution of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, primarily to drug stores, private clinics, pharmaceutical dealers and hospitals in the Southwest region of China.

Guanzan distributes both domestic and imported advanced medical devices, such as Stryker spinal products, Olympus endoscopes, imported imaging products and diagnostic imaging equipment. The majority of customers are private enterprises in China.
 
Shude primarily distributes pharmaceuticals. Shude currently distributes approximately 300 varieties of products, including raw ingredients for pharmaceutical products, antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and anti-obesity medicines. The majority of customers are private pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesale companies in China.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten wholesale medical device customers accounted for 77.27% of our wholesale medical devices revenues and four customers accounted for more than 10% of our wholesale medical devices revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten wholesale pharmaceuticals customers accounted for 50.06 % of our wholesale pharmaceuticals revenues and one customer accounted for 10% of our wholesale pharmaceuticals revenues.
 
Retail Pharmacy Business
 
Our retail pharmacy business sells pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products to customers through directly-owned retail stores. The retail stores offer a wide range of products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional supplements, traditional Chinese medicines, personal and family care products and medical devices, as well as miscellaneous items. In 2020, we sold the Boqi Pharmacy Group and established a chain of retail pharmacies under the brand name “Lijiantang Pharmacy” in the city of Chongqing, PRC (the “Lijiantang Pharmacy Group”). By year-end 2020, we had opened five pharmacies in Chongqing. Each of our pharmacies employs at least one pharmacist, a store manager and several salespersons.
 
The pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers from whom we source our products tend to provide deeper product discounts to companies with both wholesale and retail businesses.
 
We have also taken steps to build a business-to-online/offline + online-to-offline healthcare operating platform. “Business-to-online/offline” commerce is a popular business strategy in China used by businesses to draw customers to online and offline services. “Online-to-offline” commerce is a business strategy that draws potential customers from online channels to make purchases in physical stores. Online-to-offline commerce identifies customers in the online space, and then uses a variety of tools and approaches to entice the customers to leave the online space. Our goal is to rely on this operating platform to fully integrate and utilize both online and offline retail and wholesale resources. We have plans to launch an online platform where Guanzan and Shude’s wholesale customers may browse products online in lieu of, or in addition to, face to face sale meetings.
 
We favor retail locations in well-established residential communities with relatively concentrated consumer purchasing power or are located in close proximity to local hospitals, and evaluate potential store sites to assess consumer traffic, visibility and convenience. Each drugstore has at least one pharmacist on staff, all of whom are properly licensed. The average area of our pharmacy stores is 200 square meters. We only accept prescriptions from licensed health care providers, and verify the validity, accuracy, and completeness of all prescriptions. We also ask all prescription customers to disclose their drug allergies, current medical conditions, and current medications. Most pharmacies also maintain a TCM counter staffed by licensed herbalists. After opening, a location may take up to one year to achieve our projected revenue goals for that particular location. Various factors influence individual store revenue including, but not limited to, location, nearby competition, local population demographics, square footage, and government insurance coverage.
 
Products and Services
 
At present, we sell prescription drugs, OTC drugs, nutritional supplements, health foods, sundry products and medical devices through our retail pharmacy business. We also distribute medical devices and pharmaceuticals through our wholesale business.
 
Our retail pharmacy business procures its products from national wholesalers, small regional wholesalers and various pharmaceuticals trading platforms. Our wholesale business primarily sources its products from large state-owned pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers and mid-sized or small private pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers. In the year ended December 31, 2020, one vendor accounted for more than 10% of our wholesale medical devices purchases and one vendor accounted for more than 10% of our wholesale pharmaceutical purchases.

Markets and Customers
 
We started to operate in the pharmacy market upon completion of the acquisition of Boqi Zhengji in October 2019. Now we engage in retail pharmacy and wholesale sales of medical devices and pharmaceuticals. According to the PRC National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, the per capita consumption expenditure for pharmaceuticals was RMB 1,843 (approximately $283). After deducting the inflation factor, the actual increase in consumption expenditure doubled the growth rate since 2013. In terms of population structure, the aging population continues to grow. The proportion of people aged 65 and over has increased by 6.45 percentage points since 2019. Affected by factors such as expansion and population migration, the urbanization rate in China is over 60%. We believe such urban population expansion means increased demand for healthcare products. We believe that the increasing demand for pharmaceutical products, the aging of the population, the effect of the new “two-child” policy which should promote an increased demand for pediatric medications, and the steady urbanization, will cause the demand for pharmaceutical products to be stable, providing a solid foundation for the growth of the pharmaceutical industry.
Marketing and Promotion
 
Our current marketing and promotion efforts are focused on our wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and retail pharmacy segments, and our strategy is to build brand recognition, build strong customer loyalty, and develop incremental revenue opportunities.
 
For our wholesale business, we promote our products and brand through participation in trade shows and academic seminars and engaging third party professionals in advertisement efforts. We actively pursue direct sales to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies as well government centralized procurement and bidding projects.
 
In our retail stores, the store managers and staff are also encouraged to propose their own advertising and promotional plans, including holiday promotions, posters and billboards. In addition, we periodically offer special discounts and gift promotions for selected merchandise in conjunction with our suppliers’ marketing programs. We intend to invest in advertising in 2021.We also provide ancillary services such as providing free blood pressure readings in our stores.
 
Many of our promotional programs are designed to encourage manufacturers to invest resources to market their brands within our stores. We charge manufacturers promotional fees in exchange for the right to promote their products during promotional periods. Since manufacturers provide purchasing incentives and information to help customers make informed purchase decisions, we believe that manufacturer led promotions improve our customers’ shopping experience.
 
Guanzan and Shude use third party logistics services to transport their products.
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The Company’s medical devices and pharmaceuticals suppliers include national and regional large-scale pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing companies and wholesale pharmaceutical companies.
 
We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we require for our retail and wholesale businesses. As such, we believe that we can change suppliers without any material interruption to our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in sourcing our suppliers.
Quality Control
 
We strongly emphasize quality control, which starts with procurement. In addition to their market acceptance and costs, we select products based on Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Supply Practices (“GSP”) compliance by our suppliers. We also assess product quality based on the manufacturer’s facilities and capabilities, including technology, packaging and logistics. We conduct random quality inspections of each batch of products we procure and replace any supplier who fails to pass such inspections.
 
In addition to general quality control measures described above, we also enforce strict quality control measures at our storage and distribution center. All products for our wholesale and retail businesses are screened upon their arrival, and those with evidence of defects or damages are immediately rejected. Products that pass the screening process are recorded and stored strictly according to each manufacturer’s temperature and other requirements. Products (for both our pharmacies and wholesale customers) are verified against the appropriate delivery orders prior to leaving the facility. We use vehicles with cold-temperature storage to make deliveries as necessary.

Competition
 
Guanzan and Shude, our medical devices and pharmaceuticals distributors, have established distribution channels in the city of Chongqing, China. The wholesale medical devices and pharmaceutical distribution industries in China are competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with regional distributors as well as national operators. These competitors have substantially greater logistics capacities and more financial resources, as well as more industry relevant experience, than us.
 
The drugstore industry in China is likewise intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and highly fragmented. We compete on the basis of store location, merchandise selection, prices and brand recognition. Many of our competitors include large, national drugstore chains that may have more financial resources, stronger brand strength, and management expertise than us. Other competitors include local and independent drugstores and government operated pharmacies, as well as discount stores, convenience stores, and supermarkets with respect to sundry and other non-medicinal products that we carry
 
The Company plans to focus on on-line initiated sales in the future based on the use of apps and expect to compete against famous state-owned pharmacies and internet giants.
 
Research and Development
 
Currently our research and development efforts by our 10-person research and development group are focused on developing mobile APPs (a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet or watch) for our healthcare service platform. We plan to expand the functionality of the current mobile APP used by our customers. In the future, we plan to devote more resources to research and development and plans to acquire businesses with research and development capabilities.
Regulatory Compliance
 
Pharmaceutical and Ancillary Regulation
 
We started to operate in and be subject to regulations in the pharmaceutical industry upon completion of the acquisition of Boqi Zhengji in October 2019. According to the “Administrative Measures for Pharmaceutical Business Licenses” and other relevant regulations in China, we need to obtain qualification certificates the operations of our Company, including all of our subsidiaries and pharmacy stores in China. The qualification certificates mainly include the “Quality Management Certificate for Pharmaceutical Administration” (GSP Certificate) and the “Pharmaceutical Business License”. “Food Business License”, “Medical Device Business License”, “Medical Agency Practice License”, etc.
 
Our pharmacy stores have all obtained the “Pharmaceutical Business License” and the “Pharmaceutical Management Quality Management Certificate”. At the same time, all of our directly owned stores have obtained the “Internet Drug Information Service Qualification Certificate” and the “Medical Device Network Sales Record”. These business qualifications are subject to annual renewal.
 
A distributor of pharmaceutical products must obtain a distribution permit from the relevant provincial or designated municipal- or county level SFDA. The grant of such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and equipment. The distribution permit is valid for five (5) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the permit within six (6) months prior to its expiration. In addition, a pharmaceutical product distributor needs to obtain a business license from the relevant administration for industry and commerce prior to commencing its business. All of our consolidated entities that engage in the retail pharmaceutical business have obtained necessary pharmaceutical distribution permits, and we do not expect to face any difficulties in renewing these permits and/or certifications.
 
In addition, under the Supervision and Administration Rules on Pharmaceutical Product Distribution, promulgated by the SFDA on January 31, 2007, and effective May 1, 2007, a pharmaceutical product distributor is responsible for its procurement and sales activities and is liable for the actions of its employees or agents in connection with their conduct of distribution on behalf of the distributor. A retail distributor of pharmaceutical products is not allowed to sell prescription pharmaceutical products or Tier A OTC pharmaceutical products listed in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs without a valid prescription or the presence of a certified in-store pharmacist. See “Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program.”

A retail distributor of pharmaceutical products is not allowed to sell prescription pharmaceutical products or Tier A OTC pharmaceutical products listed in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs without a valid prescription or the presence of a certified in-store pharmacist. See “Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program.”
 
A distributor of nutritional supplements and other food products must obtain a food circulation permit from its local Administration of Industry and Commerce. The grant of such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor’s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel, and equipment. The food circulation permit is valid for three (3) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the certificate within thirty (30) days prior to its expiration. Guanzan Group has been received this permit for its operation.
 
GSP standards regulate wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors to ensure the quality of distribution of pharmaceutical products in China. All wholesale and retail pharmaceutical product distributors are required to apply for GSP certification within thirty (30) days after obtaining drug distribution permits. The current applicable GSP standards require pharmaceutical product distributors to implement strict controls on the distribution of pharmaceutical products, including standards regarding staff qualifications, distribution premises, warehouses, inspection equipment and facilities, management, and quality control. Specifically, the warehouse must be able to store the pharmaceutical products at various required temperatures and humidity, and handle transport, warehouse entries, delivery, and billing by computerized logistics management systems. The GSP certificate is usually valid for five (5) years. Currently, Guanzan Group is a GSP certified company.
 
Under the Rules on Administration of Prescriptions promulgated by the SFDA, effective May 1, 2007, doctors are required to include the chemical ingredients of the medicine they prescribe in their prescription and are not allowed to include brand names in their prescription. This regulation is designed to provide consumers with choices among different pharmaceutical products that contain the same chemical ingredients.
 
Eligible participants in the national medical insurance program, consisting primarily of urban residents, are entitled to purchase medicine when presenting their medical insurance cards in an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicine they purchase has been included in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs. Depending on relevant local regulations, authorized pharmacies can either (i) sell medicine on credit and obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus on a monthly basis, or (ii) receive payments from the participants at the time of their purchases, and the participants in turn obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus.
 
Medications included in the national and provincial medical insurance catalogs are divided into two (2) tiers. Purchases of Tier A pharmaceutical products are generally fully reimbursable, except that certain Tier A pharmaceutical products are only reimbursable to the extent the medications are used specifically for the purposes stated in the medical insurance catalogs. Purchasers of Tier B pharmaceutical products, which are generally more expensive than those in Tier A, are required to make a certain percentage of co-payments, with the remaining amount being reimbursable. The percentage of reimbursement for Tier B OTC products varies in different regions in the PRC. Factors that affect the inclusion of medicine in the medical insurance catalogs include whether the medicine is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in China and whether it is considered to be important in meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public.
 
7

 

China’s Ministry of Labor and Social Security, together with other government authorities, has the power to determine which medicines are included in the national medical insurance catalog every two (2) years, under which of the two (2) tiers the included medicine falls, and whether an included medicine should be removed from the catalog.
 
Under the Advertising Law of the PRC, the contents of an advertisement must be true, lawful, without falsehood, and must neither deceive nor mislead consumers. Accordingly, advertisement must be examined by the competent authority prior to its publication or broadcast through any form of media. In addition, advertisement of pharmaceutical products may only be based on a drug’s approved indication of use statement, and may not contain any assurance of a product’s efficiency, treatment efficiency, curative rate, or any other information prohibited by law. Advertisement for certain drugs should include an admonishment to seek a doctor’s advice before purchasing and application. Advertising is prohibited for certain drugs such as anesthetics and psychotropic drugs.
 
To further prevent misleading advertising of pharmaceutical products, the SAIC and the SFDA jointly promulgated the Standards for Examination and Publication of Advertisements of Pharmaceutical Products and Measures for Examination of Advertisement of Pharmaceutical Products in March 2007. Under these regulations, an approval must be obtained from the provincial level of food and drug administration before a pharmaceutical product may be advertised. In addition, once approved, an advertisement’s content may not be altered without further approval. Such approval, once obtained, is valid for one (1) year.

General Regulations
 
Because our business is situated within the PRC, our operations are subject to regulations imposed by both the PRC and local governments. These include:
 
Regulations on Annual Inspection. In accordance with relevant PRC laws, all types of enterprises incorporated under PRC laws are required to conduct annual inspections with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the PRC or its local branches. In addition, foreign invested enterprises are subject to annual inspections conducted by other applicable PRC governmental authorities. In order to reduce enterprises’ burden of submitting inspection documentation to different governmental authorities, the Measures on Implementing Joint Annual Inspection on Foreign-invested Enterprises issued in 1998 by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), together with six other ministries, stipulated that foreign-invested enterprises must participate in an annual inspection jointly conducted by all relevant PRC governmental authorities.
 
Regulations on Foreign Currency Exchange. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 2008 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) and the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities, Renminbi are freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require prior approval from SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as US dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.
 
Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local counterpart. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency receipts into Renminbi. On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated a circular regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its registered capital in foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. This circular stipulates that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within China. Violations of this circular can result in severe penalties, including monetary fines.
 
In addition, any foreign loans to an operating subsidiary in China that is a foreign invested enterprise, cannot, in the aggregate, exceed the difference between its approved total investment amount and its approved “registered capital amount”.

Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions. In October 2005, SAFE issued Circular 75, which regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a “special purpose vehicle” by PRC residents to seek offshore equity financing and conduct “return investment” in China. Under Circular 75, a “special purpose vehicle” refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC citizens or PRC entities (collectively, as PRC residents) for the purpose of seeking offshore equity financing using assets or interests owned by such PRC residents or PRC entities in onshore companies, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents through the use of “special purpose vehicles,” including without limitation, establishing foreign invested enterprises and using such foreign invested enterprises to purchase or control (by way of contractual arrangements) onshore assets. Circular 75 requires that, before establishing or controlling a “special purpose vehicle,” PRC residents are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the competent local counterparts of SAFE for their overseas investments. In addition, such PRC resident is required to amend his or her SAFE registration or to file with SAFE or its competent local branch, with respect to that offshore special purpose vehicle in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China by the offshore special purpose vehicle. To further clarify the implementation of such amendment or filing procedure, SAFE requires domestic enterprises under Circular 75 to coordinate and supervise such amendment or filings with SAFE or its local counterparts by such PRC residents. If PRC residents fail to comply, the domestic enterprises are required to report to the local SAFE authorities.
 
Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including being prohibited from distributing its profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to its offshore parent or affiliate, and restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital from the offshore entity to the PRC entities, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.
 
Regulation of Overseas Listings. On August 8, 2006, The Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”), China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”), the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, State Administration of Taxation (the “SAT”), the SAIC and SAFE jointly promulgated the “Rules on the Mergers and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors,” which became effective on September 8, 2006, and was further amended on June 22, 2009, or the M&A Rules. Among other things, the M&A Rules include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement to various types of transactions, including those which involve the use of variable interest entity agreements.
 
Regulations of Dividend Distribution. Under current applicable laws and regulations, each of our consolidated PRC entities may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our consolidated PRC entities is required to deposit at least ten percent (10%) of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year into its statutory surplus reserve fund until the accumulative amount of such reserve reaches fifty percent (50%) of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
 
Regulations Relating to Taxation. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law applies a 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, except to the extent tax incentives are granted to special industries and projects. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC withholding tax.
 
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as “resident enterprises” clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC “resident enterprises” will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects such PRC “resident enterprises” to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities.

Under the implementation regulations to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders’ meetings; and 50% or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights.
