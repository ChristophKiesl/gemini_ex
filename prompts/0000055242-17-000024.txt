BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW The Company's reportable operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company's internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities, the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. Sales and operating income by segment are presented in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K (MD&A). Additional segment data is provided in Note 20 of our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K (Item 8) which is incorporated herein by reference.
In order to take advantage of the growth opportunities of our WIDIA brand, we implemented a new operating structure at the beginning of fiscal 2017. A key attribute of the new structure is the establishment of the Widia operating segment, which we separated out from our 2016 Industrial segment. In order to better leverage the opportunities in our Widia business, and be more agile and competitive in the marketplace, we are placing higher levels of focus, determination and leadership in this business. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we had three global reportable operating segments: Industrial, Widia and Infrastructure.
INDUSTRIAL In the Industrial segment, we focus on customers in the transportation, general engineering, aerospace and defense market sectors, as well as the machine tool industry, delivering high performance metalworking tools for specified purposes. Our customers in these end markets use our products and services in the manufacture of engines, airframes, automobiles, trucks, ships and other various types of industrial equipment. The technology and customization requirements we provide vary by customer, application and industry. Industrial goes to market under the Kennametal® brand through its direct sales force, a network of independent and national chain distributors, integrated supplier channels and via the Internet. Application engineers and technicians are critical to the sales process and directly assist our customers with specified product design, selection, application and support. 
WIDIA In the Widia segment, we offer a focused assortment of standard and custom metal cutting solutions to general engineering, aerospace, energy and transportation customers. We serve our customers primarily through a network of value added resellers, integrated supplier channels and via the Internet. Widia markets its products under the WIDIA®, WIDIA Hanita® and WIDIA GTD® brands.
INFRASTRUCTURE In the Infrastructure segment, we focus on customers in the energy and earthworks market sectors that support primary industries such as oil and gas, power generation and chemicals; underground, surface and hard-rock mining; highway construction and road maintenance; and process industries such as food and feed. Our success is determined by our ability to gain an in-depth understanding of our customers’ engineering and development needs, to provide complete system solutions and high-performance capabilities to optimize and add value to their operations. Infrastructure markets its products primarily under the Kennametal® brand and sells through a direct sales force as well as distributors.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS During 2017, we generated 56 percent of our sales in markets outside of the United States of America (U.S.), with principal international operations in Western Europe, Asia and Canada. In addition, we operate additional manufacturing and distribution facilities in Israel, Latin America and South Africa, while serving customers through sales offices, agents and distributors in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. While geographic diversification helps to minimize the sales and earnings impact of demand changes in any one particular region, our international operations are subject to normal risks of doing business globally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in social, political and economic environments.
Our international assets and sales are presented in Note 20 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, set forth in Item 8 and are incorporated herein by reference. Further information about the effects and risks of currency exchange rates is presented in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section, as set forth in Item 7A of this annual report on Form 10-K (Item 7A).
STRATEGY AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS Fiscal 2017 was a year of substantial change on many levels. Early in 2017 we outlined initiatives to transform the Company through improving sales execution, simplification and lowering costs through a reduction in workforce in addition to modernization of our manufacturing plants. While each of these will continue during the coming years, we have made significant achievements in each of these areas.
Commercial execution

• | Transitioned approximately 4,100 customers to date from the direct to indirect channel to both improve customer service and refocus our direct sales force on larger accounts


• | Implementing customer classification and customer relationship management (CRM) software to improve sales efficiency


• | Reorganized the Infrastructure business around strategic business units

Simplifying the organization

• | Reduced the number of stock keeping units by 8 percent and powder formulations and coatings by 48 percent and 30 percent, respectively, to reduce manufacturing and supply chain complexity


• | Implemented minimum order quantities and economic order quantities to improve manufacturing efficiency

Lowering costs to improve margins

• | Reduced run-rate employment costs by approximately $80 million by reducing employment levels across all levels of our organization


• | Launched modernization and End-to-End process improvement programs for our manufacturing facilities, which we anticipate will generate $200 million to $300 million of additional annual savings in the next two to three years

Markets were more positive than in the prior year and exceeded our original expectations set when we embarked on fiscal 2017. Total year organic growth was 4 percent with year-over-year growth in all segments reflecting not only improving end market conditions but improving commercial execution.
Beyond these factors having a beneficial impact on our performance for the year, market forces also added some complexity to our decision-making regarding balancing between constraining our operating expenses, while also ensuring that we serve our customers appropriately in the light of increasing demand.
Our cost reduction achievements were significant, and we are well-positioned to improve further as we move steadily forward with our multi-year plans. In 2017, all restructuring programs delivered incremental benefits of approximately $72 million. Estimated ongoing annualized savings for these programs at completion by December 31, 2018 are expected to be between $165 and $180 million.
The cost savings we achieved in fiscal 2017 include only a small amount of the anticipated benefits from the modernization and End-to-End initiatives that we have planned, and the benefits from our ongoing product and process simplification initiatives. The results of those programs are anticipated to accrue to the Company over the next two to three years. At the same time, we continue to focus on cash flow and liquidity to support our planned investments. Further discussion and analysis of the development of our business is set forth in MD&A.
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We continue to evaluate new opportunities for the expansion of existing product lines into new market areas where appropriate. We also continue to evaluate opportunities for the introduction of new and/or complementary product offerings into new and/or existing market areas where appropriate. Rather than evaluating potential acquisitions in the near term, we expect to continue to grow our business and further enhance our market position through the investment opportunities that exist within our core businesses.

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Our major metallurgical raw materials consist of tungsten ore concentrates and oxides, compounds and secondary materials such as cobalt, tantalum, titanium and niobium. Although an adequate supply of these raw materials currently exists, our major sources for raw materials are located abroad and prices fluctuate at times. We have entered into extended raw material supply agreements and will implement product price increases as deemed necessary to mitigate rising costs. For these reasons, we exercise great care in selecting, purchasing and managing availability of raw materials. We also purchase steel bars and forgings for making toolholders and other tool parts, as well as for producing rotary cutting tools and accessories. We obtain products purchased for use in manufacturing processes and for resale from thousands of suppliers located in the U.S. and abroad. Our internal capabilities help mitigate our reliance on third parties for raw materials as they provide access to additional sources of raw materials and offer tungsten carbide recycling capabilities.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our product development efforts focus on providing solutions to our customers’ manufacturing challenges and productivity requirements. Our product development program provides discipline and focus for the product development process by establishing “gateways,” or sequential tests, during the development process to remove inefficiencies and accelerate improvements. This program speeds and streamlines development into a series of actions and decision points, combining efforts and resources to produce new and enhanced products faster. This program is designed to assure a strong link between customer requirements and corporate strategy, and to enable us to gain full benefit from our investment in new product development. 
We hold a number of patents and trademarks which, in the aggregate, are material to the operation of our businesses.
Research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled $38.0 million, $39.4 million and $45.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
SEASONALITY Our business is affected by seasonal variations to varying degrees by traditional summer vacation shutdowns of customers’ plants and holiday shutdowns that affect our sales levels during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year.
BACKLOG Our backlog of orders generally is not significant to our operations.
COMPETITION As one of the world’s leading producers of metalworking tools and specialty wear-resistant components and coating solutions, we maintain a leading competitive position in major markets worldwide. We continually strengthen our competitive position by developing new and innovative metalworking and earth cutting products and services, innovative surface and wear solutions and innovative products for mining, construction and road milling applications among many others. We actively compete in the sale of all our products with several large global competitors and with many smaller niche businesses offering various capabilities to customers around the world. While several of our competitors are divisions of larger corporations, our industry remains largely fragmented, containing several hundred fabricators, toolmakers and niche specialty coating businesses. Many of our competitors operate relatively small facilities, producing a limited selection of tools while buying cemented tungsten carbide components from original producers of cemented tungsten carbide products, including Kennametal. We also supply coating solutions and other engineered wear-resistant products to both larger corporations and smaller niche businesses. Given the fragmentation, opportunities for consolidation exist from both U.S.-based and internationally-based firms, as well as among thousands of industrial supply distributors.
The principal competitive differentiators in our businesses include customer focused support and application expertise, custom and standard product innovation, product performance, quality and availability, as well as service, pricing and productivity delivered ascribed to our brands. We derive competitive advantage from our premium brand positions, global presence, application expertise and ability to address unique customer needs with new and improved tools, innovative surface and wear solutions, highly engineered components, consistent quality, traditional and digital customer service and technical assistance capabilities, state-of-the-art manufacturing and multiple sales channels. With these strengths, we are able to sell products based on the value-added productivity we deliver to our customers, rather than competing solely on price.
REGULATION From time to time, we are a party to legal claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which may relate to our operations or assets, including real, tangible, or intellectual property. While we currently believe that the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to these actions will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur or if protracted litigation were to ensue, the impact could be material to us.
Compliance with government laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials or pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position for the years covered by this report, nor is such compliance expected to have a material effect in the future.

Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund), under which we have been designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and liabilities associated with these Superfund sites based upon best currently available information. We believe our environmental accruals are adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at the Superfund sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable.
Reserves for other potential environmental issues at June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $12.4 million and $12.5 million, respectively. The reserves that we have established for environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the costs of addressing all identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, and take into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies, as well as public information released by the USEPA, other governmental agencies, and by the PRP groups in which we are participating. Although the reserves currently appear to be sufficient to cover these environmental liabilities, there are uncertainties associated with environmental liabilities, and we can give no assurance that our estimate of any environmental liability will not increase or decrease in the future. The reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the U.S. government on these matters.
We maintain a Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Department to monitor compliance with environmental regulations and to oversee remediation activities. In addition, we have designated EHS coordinators who are responsible for each of our manufacturing facilities. Our financial management team periodically meets with members of the Corporate EHS Department and the Corporate Legal Department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects and contingencies. On a quarterly basis, we review financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies and adjust these reserves when appropriate.
EMPLOYEES We employed approximately 10,700 people at June 30, 2017, of which approximately 3,500 were located in the U.S. and 7,200 in other parts of the world, principally Europe, Asia Pacific and India. At June 30, 2017, approximately 2,700 of the above employees were represented by labor unions. We consider our labor relations to be generally good.
