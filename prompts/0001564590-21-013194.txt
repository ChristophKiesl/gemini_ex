Item 1. Business
Organizational Structure
 AltabancorpTM (“ALTA”) is a Utah registered bank holding company organized in 1998 under the name People’s Utah Bancorp.  As a Utah registered bank holding company, ALTA is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (“UDFI”).  ALTA operates all business activities through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, AltabankTM (the “Bank” and, together with ALTA, the “Company”), formerly known as People’s Intermountain Bank, which was organized in 1913.  The Bank is a Utah state-chartered bank subject to primary regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and by the UDFI.  The Company rebranded to AltabancorpTM effective June 30, 2020, and to AltabankTM effective November 12, 2019, respectively, and recently obtained federal trademark approval for the operating bank and holding company names and accompanying logos.
 AltabankTM is the largest community bank in Utah.  AltabankTM, a full-service bank, provides loans, deposit and cash management services to businesses and individuals through 25 branch locations from Preston, Idaho to St. George, Utah. Our clients have direct access to bankers and decision-makers who work with clients to understand their specific needs and offer customized financial solutions. AltabankTM has been serving communities in Utah and southern Idaho for more than 100 years.
 During the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Company, specifically the Bank’s operations.  The Company instituted an internal pandemic response team that meets on a bi-weekly basis and consists of executive management and members of senior leadership in legal, IT, operations, and marketing.  In response to state and local government guidance and mandates, including “stay at home” orders, the Bank reduced operating hours and/or closed lobbies at various branch locations and transitioned much of its workforce to remote-working.  The Bank’s pandemic response plan aligns with the Utah COVID-19 Transmission Index.  The Bank also implemented COVID-19 protocols, such as the wearing of masks, the use of other personal protective equipment, and observance of social distancing, in its branch, service center, and office locations.  The Bank adapted and facilitated access for its clients during the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic through accelerated development and implementation of digital delivery channels and online products and services.  The Bank provided substantial financial relief to its clients through participation in government programs, as well as its own payment relief programs.  The Bank provided payment accommodations to almost twenty percent of its clients and offered first round Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans to over 300 clients.
 Market Area
 Most of the major business and economic activity in Utah is located in the counties where AltabankTM branches are located. Over 75% of Utah’s population is concentrated along Interstate 15, specifically within Davis, Weber, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties. The next largest population centers in the State are in Washington and Cache Counties. These six counties make up approximately 85% of Utah’s population. AltabankTM has benefited from strong economic performance in the State of Utah.  The following highlights some of the economic metrics for Utah:

 We grew organically with increases in both deposits and loans in 2020.  We focused on building and increasing commercial client relationships in our market area through staffing additions to our Commercial Banking Centers in Salt Lake County and Utah County and the implementation of Home Builder Finance and Investment Real Estate verticals during 2020.  We continue to look for strategic acquisition opportunities in our existing market area and surrounding states.

 Competition
 The banking and financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive. We compete for loans, deposits, and clients with other commercial banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial services providers.  Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization than we are; have greater access to capital markets than we do; and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer.
 
The competition for deposit and loan products is strong and directly affects the pricing of those products and the terms we offer to our clients. Price competition for deposits may adversely affect our ability to generate low-cost core deposits in our primary markets sufficient to fund our asset growth. As a result, we may seek alternative funding through other borrowings.  We may also need to price our deposit products more aggressively, which would result in an increase in our costs of funding and reduce our net interest margins.  Both our deposit base and overall market share have increased over the past several years.  However, larger financial institutions have also grown their respective deposit market shares in our markets. We believe aggressive marketing and advertising, branch expansion, expanded delivery channels, and rates that are more attractive have allowed larger banks to continue to increase their overall market share. Technological innovation has also contributed to greater competition in the overall financial services sector.
 The market shares of AltabankTM and its largest competitors in Utah, ranked by deposit market share at June 30, 2020, as reported by S&P Global Market Intelligence are as follows:

Our Business Activities
 We believe that to be competitive with larger financial institutions, it is imperative that we provide superior client service.  Key elements to our client service include: i) seasoned relationship managers who understand our clients’ financial needs; ii) direct access to decision makers; iii) the products and services our clients need; iv) unparalleled responsiveness to our clients; and v) technology solutions that make it easier for our clients to transact business with us. 
 We provide banking services primarily to small- to medium-sized businesses and to individuals in our primary markets including Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, Cache, Box Elder, and Washington Counties. Our business clients are involved in a variety of industries, including residential and commercial acquisition development and construction; manufacturing; distribution and other services. We also provide a broad range of banking services and products to individuals, including residential mortgage lending, personal checking and savings accounts, and online banking.
 Lending
 We offer a variety of lending products including acquisition, development and construction (“ADC”); commercial and industrial (“C&I”); home builder financing; multifamily residential; single-family residential; home equity lines; equipment finance; and other consumer loans.  We have established portfolio thresholds for each of our lending categories and regularly monitor and evaluate the diversification of our portfolio. From time to time, we purchase and sell non-consumer loan participations from or to other banks. Loan participations purchased by us have been underwritten using our standard underwriting criteria. 
 Our clients are generally comprised of the following groups:
  
• | Real estate developers and contractors in need of land, construction and permanent financing for commercial and residential developments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small- to medium-sized businesses in need of secured and unsecured lines of credit through Small Business Association (“SBA”) financing or conventional C&I term loans and lines of credit, equipment financing, owner occupied or investor-commercial real estate loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small- to medium-sized businesses in need of cash management, payments, credit cards, or merchant services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Individuals in need of residential construction loans, residential mortgages and other consumer loan products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Professionals and professional firms, such as medical, architectural, engineering, and financial firms in need of operating facilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real Estate
 We focus on commercial and residential real estate lending throughout a project’s life cycle, including acquisition and development loans, construction loans, and long-term financing.
 Construction, Acquisition and Development Loans. Our construction loan portfolio consists of single-family residential properties, multifamily properties and commercial projects. Construction lending entails significant additional risks compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Construction loans also involve additional risks as funds are advanced while the property is under construction, and may have uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. Therefore, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total proceeds required to complete a project.  It is also more difficult to know whether related loan-to-value ratios will be sufficient to compensate for fluctuations in the real estate values in order to minimize the risk of loss. Maturities for construction loans generally range from six to twelve months for residential property and from twelve to thirty months for commercial and multifamily properties.
 5


Our development loans are secured by the properties being platted and developed. Lending on raw land carries a significant risk of a change in market conditions during the development process. Our borrowers’ projects generally range from small plats of two to six lots to subdivisions with up to one hundred lots. Development lending on large projects is handled in specialty groups with expertise regarding the lending risks and market dynamics of land development.  During the development process, we fund costs for site clearing, grading, and infrastructure, including utilities and roads. We focus on lending to developers with the experience and financial wherewithal to successfully complete the project and weather unforeseen changes to the project or the market.  Lot release minimum prices are agreed upon at loan closing. Repayment of the development loan is generally structured to require net sale proceeds from lot sales of a minimum of 125% of the Bank’s per-lot exposure. We target most development loans to be paid off at no more than 80% of total development sales. Loan-to-cost ratios on development loans typically range from 55% to 70%, depending on the financial strength and experience of the developer. Most development loans have maturities of twelve to twenty-four months.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. We also originate mortgages for commercial real estate properties. These loans are primarily secured by commercial real estate, including office, retail, warehouse, industrial, and other non-residential properties. The majority of these loans have maturities generally ranging from three to ten years and loan amortizations from fifteen to twenty-five years.
 Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risk compared with the residential mortgage lending. Commercial mortgage loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent than is the case with residential mortgage loans, to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the general economy. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria requires an examination of debt-service-coverage ratios, the net worth and liquidity of the borrowers and any guarantors, and the borrowers’ and any guarantors’ creditworthiness and prior credit history and reputation.  We generally require personal guarantees or endorsements with respect to these loans. In the loan underwriting process, we also carefully consider the location of the property serving as collateral, as well as the tenants occupying the property.
 Loan-to-value ratios for non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans generally do not exceed 75%. We permit loan-to-value ratios of up to 75% if the property is owner-occupied and the borrower has strong liquidity, net worth, and positive cash flows. We have been active in both the construction lending and permanent financing of our commercial real estate portfolio. Construction and raw land loans are short-term in nature and generally do not exceed eighteen months. Permanent commitments are primarily restricted to no greater than ten year maturities with rate adjustment periods primarily every three to five years when fixed commitments exist.  Occasional ten year fixed rate loans are offered on owner occupied and multi-family commercial real estate. Loan amortizations are typically between fifteen to twenty-five years.  Large non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans (in excess of $10 million) are handled in a specialty group with expertise in the lending risks and market dynamics of commercial real estate.
 Residential Mortgage Loans. Our residential mortgage loans consist of residential construction loans, residential first and second mortgage loans, and home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the residences of borrowers. Second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are used for home improvements, education and other personal expenditures. We make mortgage loans with a variety of terms, including fixed, floating and variable interest rates and a variety of loan maturities. We sell substantially all of the first lien residential mortgage loans that we originate to larger financial institutions. We provide loan servicing for some of our mortgage loans, depending upon the relationship of the borrower to us.
 Residential mortgage loans generally are made based on the borrowers’ ability to repay the loan from the borrower’s salary and other income.  The loan is secured by residential real estate, which value is generally readily ascertainable. These loans are made consistent with our appraisal and real estate lending policies, which detail maximum loan-to-value ratios and maturities. Home equity lines of credit secured by owner-occupied property generally are made with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80%, including the first mortgage, if applicable.
 6


Commercial and Industrial (non-real estate):
 Commercial and Industrial Loans (“C&I”). We make C&I loans to qualified businesses in our market area. Our commercial lending portfolio consists primarily of C&I loans for the financing of accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment. We also offer loans guaranteed by the SBA.
 C&I loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flows of its business and are secured by business assets with less easily determinable or achievable value, such as accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. Lines of credit typically have a 12 month commitment with a variable rate.  The loans are secured by the assets that are being financed. In cases of larger commitments, a borrowing base certificate is required to determine eligible collateral and advance parameters. Term loans are generally up to sixty months, but in no case exceed the depreciable life of the tangible asset being financed. C&I loans generally include personal guarantees as additional support.
 To manage these risks, our policy is to secure commercial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and other collateral and guarantees that may be available. In addition, we actively monitor certain measures of the borrower, including advance rates, cash flows, overall capital leverage, collateral value and other appropriate credit factors.
 Large or complex C&I loans are handled by our three commercial banking centers with expertise in the lending risks and market dynamics of C&I loans.
 Consumer Loans
 Consumer Loans. Our consumer loans consist primarily of installment loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes. The specific types of consumer loans we make include home equity loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, debt consolidation loans and general consumer lending.
 Consumer loans may entail greater risk than real estate loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured, such as lines of credit, or secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. A loan may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loan, such as a bank, and a borrower may be able to assert against such assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral.
 Our policy for consumer loans is to accept moderate risk while minimizing losses, primarily through a careful credit and financial analysis of the borrower. In evaluating consumer loans, we require our lending officers to review the borrower’s level and stability of income, past credit history, amount of debt currently outstanding and the impact of these factors on the ability of the borrower to repay the loan in a timely manner. In addition, we require our banking officers to maintain an appropriate margin between the loan amount and collateral value.
 We also issue credit cards to certain clients. In determining to whom we will issue credit cards, we evaluate the borrower’s level and stability of income, past credit history and other factors. Finally, we make additional loans that are not classified in one of the above categories. In making such loans, we attempt to ensure that the borrower meets our loan underwriting standards.

SBA Loans
 We have been an SBA Preferred Lender since 2002. As a Preferred Lender, we can approve a loan within the authority delegated to us by the SBA and are not required to go through the SBA directly on a per loan basis. 
 SBA loans fall into two categories: (i) loans originated under the SBA’s 7(a) Program, and (ii) loans originated under the SBA’s 504 Program. Through SBA 7(a) Loans, funds can be utilized to purchase or construct real property; however, we primarily use the 7(a) Program for working capital, inventory, or equipment loans, which are included in our C&I loans.  SBA 504 loans typically do not have an SBA guaranty, but rather, a low 50% loan to value ratio due to the assistance of the 504 program. SBA 504 loans are generally classified as commercial real estate.  However, a 504 loan may be used to finance long-lived equipment.  Our SBA lending program, and portions of our real estate lending, are dependent on the continual funding and programs of certain federal agencies or quasi-government corporations, including the SBA.  We participated in the first and second rounds of the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program.
 Loan Underwriting and Credit Policies
 Our Credit Department establishes our lending policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. These lending policies are reviewed at least annually and evaluated from time to time by senior lending management. Key elements of our current policies are debt service coverage, balance sheet analysis, monitoring concentration levels, maintaining strict approval, and underwriting procedures.
 Debt Service Coverage. Our risk management philosophy is to extend credit only when an applicant has proven cash flow to service the proposed debt. Additionally, it is generally necessary for the applicant to demonstrate an independent secondary source of repayment.
 Balance Sheet Analysis.  Additional repayment support, such as liquidity, working capital, and sufficient equity is found on the balance sheet.  For this reason, the balance sheets of our borrowers are analyzed in the underwriting process.
 Monitor Concentration Levels. We have established maximum concentrations for each loan type and regularly monitor and evaluate the diversification of our loan portfolio. We have significant concentration in real estate loans. 
 Loans to One Borrower. In addition to the maximum concentration for loan types, state-banking law limits the aggregate extensions of credit that a bank may make to a single borrower. Under Utah law, the aggregate extensions of credit that a bank may make to a single borrower may not exceed 15% of the Bank’s Tier 1 capital, which equaled $59.1 million as of December 31, 2020.  
 Approval and Underwriting Procedures. All loan requests must be approved under specified approval guidelines. Credit approval authorities are listed below from lowest to highest level.  Loans with certain credit policy exceptions require approval from one level higher.  Management believes the current authority levels are appropriate to ensure overall credit quality, while ensuring we are able to respond in a timely manner to lending opportunities. Any conditions placed on loans in the approval process must be satisfied before our credit administration will release loan documentation for execution. Our credit administration works independently of loan production and has full responsibility for all loan disbursements.
Bank Lending Authorities:
  
• | Individual Authorities — Branch Managers have credit approval authority to loan up to $50,000 for consumer loans provided there are no exceptions to loan policy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Region Manager Authorities — Region Managers have credit approval authority to approve real estate secured loans up to $500,000, non-real estate loans up to $250,000, and unsecured loans up to $50,000. If a single family construction loan has a long-term take out approved, a regional manager can approve up to the Fannie / Freddie conforming loan limit. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Senior Credit Risk Officer Authorities – The Bank has two Senior Credit Risk Officers who have credit authority to approve all loan relationships up to $5,000,000.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Chief Credit Officer Authorities – The Chief Credit Officer of the Bank has credit approval authority to approve all loan relationships up to $10,000,000.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combined Authorities – The Chief Credit Officer and one of the Senior Credit Risk Officers can combine approval authorities to approve loan relationships up to $15,000,000.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management Committee Authorities — The Bank Loan Committee meets as needed and consists of the Chief Credit Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Banking Officer, and two Senior Credit Risk Officers. This committee has credit approval authority for loan relationships up to $20,000,000. The loans approved in this committee that exceed $15 million are reported to the Board of Directors monthly. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Board Committee Authorities — The Board Loan Committee is comprised of three directors, with two committee members required for a quorum. All loan relationships in excess of $20,000,000 require the concurrence of this committee. The committee meets weekly, as needed, to review loans approved by the Bank Loan Committee. This committee concurs on loan approvals up to our legal lending limit, which was approximately $59.1 million as of December 31, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Loan Grading and Loan Review.  We seek to quantify the risk in our lending portfolio by maintaining a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories (Grades 1-9). The grading system is used to determine, in part, the level of allowance for credit losses held by us. The first five grades in the system are considered satisfactory. The next four grades range from a “Special Mention” category to a “Loss” category.
 The originating loan officer initially assigns a grade to each credit as part of the loan approval process. Such grade may be changed as a loan application moves through the approval process. In addition to any dollar limitations that may require higher credit approval authority, each loan that is graded “Substandard” or worse with a balance of $250,000 or greater requires prior approval of the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer.
 The grade on each individual loan is subject to review from time to time, and may be changed if warranted. The Bank’s senior lending officers meet quarterly to review the Bank’s criticized loans.  This consists of all loans graded substandard, or worse, along with all loans graded special mention for six months or longer. Additionally, changes in the grade for a loan may occur through any of the following means:
  
• | review of monthly delinquency reports by Region Managers, Senior Credit Risk Officers, and the Chief Credit Officer;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specific changes in loan grades by the loan officer, upon receiving new information that adversely impacts the borrower’s credit standing or other perceived credit risks;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | random reviews of the loan portfolio conducted by senior lending officers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loan reviews conducted by an outside loan reviewer or internal loan review department; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bank regulatory examinations.
--+------------------------------

 Special Mention.  Generally acceptable asset quality, but frequent and thorough monitoring is required as temporary credit weaknesses may extend beyond financial into managerial and demographic issues. Borrowers may have strained cash flow and less than anticipated performance. Borrowers may have possible management weaknesses, perhaps demonstrated by an irregular flow of adequate or timely performance information required to support the credit. Borrowers may have a plausible plan to correct problems in the near future without material uncertainties. Borrowers may lack reserve capacity, so their risk rating will generally either improve or decline in a relatively short period since results of corrective actions should be apparent within six months or less. These loans exhibit an increasing reliance on collateral for repayment.
 Loan Delinquencies.  When a borrower fails to make a committed payment, we attempt to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower to seek payment. The Chief Credit Officer regularly reviews 
 9


delinquency reports with Region Managers for possible changes in loan risk ratings. Our Credit Committee meets quarterly to review classified assets. The Credit Committee is comprised of executive officers and senior credit administration of the Bank.
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations require that each insured bank classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have authority to identify problem assets, and, if appropriate, reclassify them. 

• | Substandard — Unacceptable business credit; asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Though no loss is envisioned, the outlook is sufficiently uncertain to preclude ruling out the possibility; some liquidation of assets may be necessary as a corrective measure. Assets in this category may demonstrate performance problems such as cash flow deterioration trends including current or long-term debt service deficiencies with no immediate relief; borrower’s inability to adjust to prolonged and unfavorable industry or economic trends; management character and/or effectiveness have become suspect.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Doubtful — Undesirable credit with loss potential. An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans. At the point where a loss is identified, all or that portion deemed a loss is immediately classified as “Loss” and charged off.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loss — Total loss is expected. An uncollectible asset or one of such little value that it does not warrant classification as an active, earning asset. Such an asset may, however, have recovery or salvage value, but not to the point of deferring full write-off, even though some recovery may occur in the future. Our policy is to charge off such assets as a loss during the accounting period in which they were identified. These assets have been determined to have identifiable, uncollectible components. Typically, a partial charge-off of the loss will have occurred, and the balance remaining would be reflective of management’s best estimate of collectability.

Our Investment Activities
 Our investment strategy is designed to be complementary to and interactive with our cash position; borrowed funds; quality, maturity, stability and earnings of loans; nature and stability of deposits; capital and tax planning. Investment securities consist primarily of U.S. Agency issues, mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds.  In addition, for liquidity purposes, we use Federal Funds Sold, which is temporary overnight sales of excess funds to correspondent banks. Our securities portfolio is managed in accordance with guidelines set by our investment policy, which is approved by the board once a year. Specific day-to-day transactions affecting the securities portfolio are managed by the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Bank.
 Our general objectives with respect to our investment portfolio are to:
  
• | provide liquidity necessary to meet cyclical and long-term changes in the mix of assets and liabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | achieve an acceptable asset/liability gap position based on our separate policy related to asset and liability management that provides guidance for how investments are to be used to manage asset and liability gaps;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain collateral for pledging requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | manage interest rate risk;
--+---------------------------


• | provide a suitable balance of quality and diversification to our assets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide a stable flow of dependable earnings.
--+----------------------------------------------

Deposit Products and Other Sources of Funds
 Our primary sources of funds for use in our lending and investing activities consist of:
  
• | deposits;
--+----------


• | maturities and principal and interest payments on loans and securities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other short-term borrowings.
--+-----------------------------

 We closely monitor rates and terms of competing sources of funds and utilize those sources we believe to be the most cost-effective, consistent with our asset and liability management policies.
 An important balance sheet component affecting our net interest margin is the composition and cost of our deposit base. We can improve our net interest margin to the extent that growth in deposits is from less volatile and somewhat more traditional core deposits or total deposits less CDs greater than $250,000, commonly referred to as Jumbo CDs. We attempt to price our deposit products competitively with other financial institutions in our marketplace to promote deposit growth and satisfy our liquidity requirements and offer a variety of deposit products to satisfy our clients’ needs.
 We provide a wide array of deposit products. We have historically relied upon, and expect to continue to rely upon, deposits to satisfy our needs for funds. We offer regular checking, rewards checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts. We also offer fixed-rate, fixed maturity retail CDs ranging in terms from 30 days to six years, individual retirement accounts and Jumbo CDs. The primary sources of deposits are small- to medium-sized businesses and individuals within our target market. All deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law. We have a service fee schedule, which we believe is competitive with other financial institutions in our market, covering, among others, maintenance fees on checking accounts, per item processing fees on checking accounts, returned check charges and other similar fees.
 We intend to continue our efforts to attract deposits from our business lending relationships in order to reduce our cost of funds and improve our net interest margin. We also believe that we have the ability to attract sufficient additional funding by re-pricing the yields on our CDs to meet loan demands during times that growth in core deposits differs from loan demand. To fund loan demand, we have also utilized funding from two programs offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network called Certificate of Deposit Registry Service or CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep or ICS. This relationship allows the Bank to utilize a national network of banks to offer deposit insurance coverage for large depositors. This protection occurs in deposit increments of less than $250,000 per participating bank to ensure that both principal and interest are eligible for full FDIC insurance. 
 In addition to our traditional marketing methods, we attract new clients and deposits by:
  
• | expanding long-term business client relationships, including referrals from our clients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | deploying personnel to work new leads with loan officers and branch managers to obtain new business clients; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investing in technology that focuses on client experience through our branch network, online, mobile banking, and cash management suites and enhance deposit relationships through various channels.

 Other Borrowings. We may occasionally use our overnight credit to support liquidity needs created by seasonal deposit flows, to satisfy temporary funding needs from increased loan demand, and for other short-term purposes.  We have an unsecured line of credit with a regional correspondent financial institution pursuant to which we can borrow funds generally on an overnight basis.  The correspondent financial institution may impose collateral requirements or terminate the line of credit at any time.  We have the collateral capacity to borrow from the Federal Reserve. We can also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) pursuant to an existing commitment based on the value of the collateral pledged which generally consists of certain real estate loans and investment securities.

Risk Management
 
We are committed to identifying and managing our overall enterprise risk exposure.  We have identified strategic, reputation, credit, market, liquidity, operational (including cyber related risks), legal, and compliance risks as the areas that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects.  We mitigate and actively manage these areas of risk through sound practices and procedures and committed experienced personnel.
 We have focused our enterprise risk management efforts in the following areas:
  
• | Our Board established the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee to monitor enterprise risks of the Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Executive Risk Management Committee assesses enterprise risks and takes appropriate action to mitigate such risks;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a dedicated enterprise risk management team that actively monitors enterprise risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | Our credit department is staffed to maintain credit policies and procedures, loan documentation, and disbursement of loan proceeds, and to manage the integrity of the credit risk rating system;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our finance department is staffed with experienced personnel to manage market and liquidity risk and capital adequacy;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our operations and information technology departments include staff experienced in operating risks, bank regulations, and in information technology, cyber security, and information security compliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our legal and compliance departments coordinate efforts to effectively manage legal and compliance matters and keep executive management apprised of the same; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our internal audit department reports its independent audit findings directly to our Board’s Audit and Compliance Committee.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDIC has provided guidance recommending that if the sum of (i) certain categories of commercial real estate, or CRE, loans and (ii) acquisition, development and construction, or ADC, loans exceeds 300% of total risk-based capital, or if ADC loans exceed 100% of total risk based capital, heightened risk management practices should be employed to mitigate risk. Our concentration in ADC loans is cyclical and tends to increase in the second and third quarters of each year as demand for ADC loans increases. An increase in ADC loan concentration could cause our ratio for ADC loans to increase and even exceed the FDIC’s guideline. We have exceeded these guidance ratios at times in the past and may do so in the future.  We actively monitor and believe that we effectively manage our CRE and ADC loan concentrations.  If we exceed the FDIC’s guidelines and do not effectively manage the risk of our CRE and ADC loans, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny including a requirement to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations, or undertake other remedial actions.
 Human Capital Resources
 Achieving our vision of being the best bank for our clients, shareholders, employees, and communities is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain highly qualified and motivated employees at every level who share our core values. To hire and retain the best talent, we strive to create a culture that enables all of our employees to find personal satisfaction through meaningful responsibilities and opportunities for professional growth. Our employees are some of our most valuable assets, and we treat them as such with competitive compensation, health, retirement, and other benefits.
Employee Profile
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 471 full and part-time employees in 25 branch locations throughout Utah and Idaho. Our employees are not represented by any labor organization, and we are not aware of any activity to seek such organization. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 61% of our employees are women, 39% are men, and our average employee tenure is 7.2 years.  
 Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
 Our commitment to diversity starts with our Board of Directors, which is committed to setting a strategic vision for the Company that reflects a diverse and inclusive environment and culture.  The Bank actively participates in initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion both internally and externally.  We have active representation on the Utah Bankers’ Association’s Women In Banking Committee and participate in its annual summit for women in banking.  The Company recently participated in Intermountain Healthcare Foundation’s and Primary Children’s Hospital’s “Healthy Kids Initiative’s Reach Out and Read” children’s literacy program in Utah County, donating over 400 books for children in Title 1 schools.  We recently sponsored a social media-based contest to recognize Black-owned small businesses in Utah and Idaho in honor of Black History Month.  We sponsor an annual scholarship for the Utah Valley University business school that provides financial assistance for women and underrepresented student populations.  The Company recently became a sponsor for Wasatch Adaptive 
 13


Sports, a local non-profit that runs a year-round outdoor activities program for individuals with special needs and disabilities.  Approximately 15% of the Company’s charitable contributions for 2020 were given to entities or programs serving low to moderate income populations in our communities.     
 Core Values
 We believe our values guide our success. Our values include:
  
• | We Care.
--+---------


• | We Are Safe.
--+-------------


• | We Innovate.
--+-------------


• | We Execute.
--+------------


• | We Are Professional.
--+---------------------


• | Integrity Is Absolute.
--+-----------------------

 
To demonstrate these values and put each of them into practice, we have adopted a New Heights program to help all employees know and understand Who We Are and How We Work. In 2020, the New Heights program included a series of podcasts hosted by the Company’s Chief People Officer and the Director of Learning and Talent Development, featuring our executive management team and other guests.  These podcasts allowed our employees to learn what principles influence our leadership team and how our values are implemented on a day-to-day basis. Other training and leadership materials are also available to our employees through the New Heights program.
 
Compensation, Benefits, Wellness
 
We believe that compensation must be competitive with the market in order to attract and retain qualified employees. In addition to strong base salaries and wages, additional compensation programs include annual discretionary bonuses, awards of share options and restricted share units, an augmented employee stock ownership plan, and a matched 401(k) plan. We also provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits program, including health, dental and vision insurance, life and accident insurance, long-term disability coverage, and holiday, vacation, and sick leave. See Note 11 in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” for additional information regarding employee benefit plans and profit sharing.
 
To promote the wellness of our employees, we provide employees access to a wellness program that promotes regular activity and a healthy lifestyle.  In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, which resulted in the majority of our employees working remotely and us putting in place additional safety measures for employees working on-site.
 Culture Change Management
 In an effort to drive results and build a unified corporate culture, we recently engaged Partners In Leadership, a nationally known leadership training and management consulting firm, to assist us in culture change and leadership development initiatives across the organization.
Active Community Engagement
 We encourage our employees to be participate in community organizations and volunteer activities.  We also encourage our employees to serve in leadership roles in these organizations.  We are proud to support many local community organizations through financial contributions and employee volunteers, 
 14


including the American Fork Parks Trails and Recreation Committee, Utah Legal Services, Utah Microloan Fund, Operation Underground, and the McKay Dee Hospital Board.  
 Succession Planning
 Our Board of Directors reviews annually succession planning for our CEO and other key executive management members.  We have increased our focus and attention on training, talent development, and leadership opportunities for employees.  We recently implemented a new HRIS, one module of which enables executive management to better review, assess, and manage succession planning.
Employee Recruiting, Development, and Training
 We use both internal and external resources to recruit highly qualified employees, and we compensate employees for referrals for open positions. In addition, we encourage existing employees to apply for positions and hire internally when appropriate. 
 We are committed to fostering an environment of inclusion, and we do not tolerate harassment or discrimination within the Company. We take seriously our responsibility to help create a diverse workplace that is free of inappropriate conduct, bullying, threats, offensive jokes or language, harassment, or intimidation. We consider all qualified internal and external applicants for open positions without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, protected veteran status, or any other status or condition protected by applicable federal, state, or local law.
 We believe that ongoing training is important in the development and success of new and existing employees, and we strive to create a work environment that nurtures innovation and growth. Employees have access to e-learning and online compliance training. 
 Employees participate in annual reviews, setting goals, and evaluating and measuring success. Managers and employees also conduct ongoing feedback and performance reviews, with weekly department meetings and monthly one-on-one meetings encouraged.

General
 As a Utah registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by the UDFI. In addition, as a Utah state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank is subject to primary regulation, supervision, and examination by the FDIC and by the UDFI. Supervision, regulation, and examination of the Company by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors, and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), rather than for holders of our capital stock.
 Banking and other financial services statutes, regulations, and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters, and similar written guidance applicable to the Company. Any change in the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to the Company, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business and operations. 
 Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which the Company are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors, such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and its implementing regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”), includes a number of provisions that are favorable to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company, and makes changes to consumer mortgage and credit reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry. 
 Supervisory Examinations
 The Company is subject to periodic examinations by federal and state banking regulators.  The examinations review and assess the Company’s financial condition and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  The Company 
receives confidential supervisory ratings from such examinations that may not be disclosed to third parties.  Supervisory exam findings, recommendations, or ratings may impact the Company’s ability to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities, engage in certain business activities, and subject the Company to additional regulatory oversight and requirements.  The FDIC and Utah DFI completed their most recent joint safety and soundness exam of the Company on January 29, 2021.     
Holding Company Regulation
 Permitted Activities
 Under the federal Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”), a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire, direct or indirect control of more than five percent of any class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and that is engaged in certain enumerated activities that are related to banking. While the Federal Reserve has treated those activities as acceptable in the past for other bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve in the future may not allow us to conduct any or all of these activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of those activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity, or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Acquisitions Subject to Prior Regulatory Approval
 The BHCA requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for a bank holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more 
 16


than 5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company, or savings association, or to increase any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, bank holding company, or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any bank holding company.  In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors, including the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects (including current and projected capital ratios and levels); the competence, experience, and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)); the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. In addition, approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquirer satisfy regulatory standards for well-capitalized and well-managed institutions.
 Bank Holding Company Obligations to Bank Subsidiaries
 Under current law and Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries and to maintain resources adequate to support such subsidiaries, which could require the Company to commit resources to support the Bank in situations where additional investments in a bank may not otherwise be warranted. A bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries in the form of capital notes or other instruments that qualify as capital under applicable regulatory rules. Any such loan from a holding company to a subsidiary bank is likely to be unsecured and subordinated to the bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank. If the Company were to enter bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends
 The Federal Reserve’s policy regarding dividends is that a bank holding company should not declare or pay a cash dividend that would impose undue pressure on the capital of any bank subsidiary or which would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Should an insured depository institution controlled by a bank holding company be “significantly undercapitalized” under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank subsidiary is “undercapitalized” and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, banking regulators (in the case of the Bank, the FDIC and the UDFI) may choose to require prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by the bank holding company. In addition, since we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and do not conduct stand-alone operations, an ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us and the FDIC and the UDFI may, under certain circumstances, prohibit the payment of dividends to us from the Bank as described below in “Bank Regulation—Bank Dividends.”
 Capital Regulations – U.S. Basel III Capital Rules
 In July 2013, federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, adopted the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, implementing many aspects of the Basel III Capital Standards. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules impose higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously 
 17


in place. In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in and became fully effective on January 1, 2019, and consists of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules also increase the risk weight for assets, meaning that more capital must be held against such assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150% rather than the current 100%.
 Additionally, the Basel III Capital Standards provide for the deduction of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities); (ii) mortgage-servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We opted out of this treatment.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of the risk weights and the introduction of new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework and following a one-year deferral due to the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches banking organizations, and not to the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by federal bank regulators.
 In December 2018, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a joint final rule revising regulatory capital rules to address the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (“Topic 326”), requiring organizations to measure current except credit losses (“CECL”) for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The final rule made a number of changes to the regulatory capital rules to reflect revised credit standards.  The Company fully-adopted CECL effective January 1, 2020.  
 For a detailed discussion of the Company’s actual capital ratios and capital adequacy, see “Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 9 – Regulatory Capital Matters” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 Other Applicable Regulations
 ALTA is a public company subject to the disclosure and compliance requirements promulgated by the SEC.  ALTA is also subject to the rules of Nasdaq as a listed company (ticker symbol: ALTA) on that exchange.
Bank Regulation
 The Bank is a Utah state-chartered commercial bank, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the UDFI and the FDIC. The UDFI and the FDIC supervise and regulate all areas of the Bank’s operations, including, without limitation, the making of loans, deposit operations, the conduct of the Bank’s corporate affairs, and the satisfaction of capital-adequacy requirements, the payment of dividends, 
 18


and the establishment or closing of banking offices. The UDFI and the FDIC periodically examine the Bank’s operations and financial condition and compliance with federal consumer-protection laws. In addition, the Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the FDIC has certain enforcement powers over the Bank.
 Capital Adequacy
 See “Holding Company Regulation—Capital Regulations” above.
 Capitalization Levels and Prompt Corrective Action
 Federal law and regulations establish a capital-based regulatory scheme designed to promote early intervention for troubled banks and require the FDIC to choose the least expensive resolution of bank failures. The capital-based regulatory framework contains five categories of regulatory capital requirements, including “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” To qualify as a “well capitalized” institution, a bank must have a leverage ratio of no less than 5.0%, a common equity to Tier 1 Capital ratio of no less than 6.5%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of no less than 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10.0%, and a bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Generally, a financial institution must be “well capitalized” before the Federal Reserve will approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank or merge with a bank holding company, and the FDIC applies the same requirement in approving bank merger applications.  As of December 31, 2020, the Bank met these capital levels.
 Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDIA, which, among other things: (i) restricts payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) requires that the FDIC monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) requires submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restricts the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) requires prior approval of certain expansion proposals. Bank holding companies controlling depository institutions can be called upon to increase the depository institution’s capital and to partially guarantee the institution’s performance under their capital restoration plans. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; (iv) requiring the institution to change and improve its management; (v) prohibiting the acceptance of deposits from correspondent banks; (vi) requiring prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by a bank holding company controlling the institution; and (vii) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.
 As of December 31, 2020, the Bank exceeded the requirements contained in the applicable regulations, policies and directives pertaining to capital adequacy to be classified as “well capitalized.” Rapid growth, poor loan portfolio performance, poor earnings performance, or a combination of these or other factors, could change the Bank’s capital position in a relatively short period, making additional capital infusions necessary.  It should be noted that the minimum ratios referred to above in this section are merely guidelines, and the Bank regulators possess the discretionary authority to require higher capital ratios.
 On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the OCC issued an interim final rule (FIL-37-2020 effective immediately) to provide regulatory capital relief for FDIC-supervised institutions issuing loans under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and participating in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending (“PPPL”) Facility.  Under Section 1102 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), PPP loans receive a zero-percent risk weight under the agencies’ regulatory capital rules, regardless of whether they are pledged as collateral 
 19


to the PPPL Facility.  However, PPP loans are included in a bank’s leverage ratio requirement unless they are pledged as collateral to the PPPL Facility.  The Bank participated in the PPPL Facility during 2020, pledging PPP loans in the approximate amount of $84.6 million.
Bank Reserves
 The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions, even if not members of the Federal Reserve, to maintain reserves against some deposit accounts. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements. An institution may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank “discount window” as a secondary source of funds, if the institution meets the Federal Reserve Bank’s credit standards.
Bank Dividends
 Utah law places restrictions on the declaration of dividends by Utah state-chartered banks to their shareholders. This may decrease any amount available for the payment of dividends in a particular period if the surplus funds for the Bank fail to comply with this limitation. The FDIC and the UDFI may, under certain circumstances, prohibit the payment of dividends to the Company from the Bank. Utah corporate law also requires that dividends only be paid out of funds legally available therefor.
Insurance of Accounts and Other Assessments
 FDIC deposit insurance is critical to the continued operation of the Bank. The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, which are determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns an institution to a risk category based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations, which are designed to measure risk. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement, or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
 The Bank is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”), and the implementing of Regulation W by the Federal Reserve. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Bank. Accordingly, certain asset transactions and contracts, between the Company, the Bank, and any non-bank subsidiaries are subject to a number of restrictions. All such transactions, as well as contracts entered into between the Bank and affiliates, must be on terms that are no less favorable to the Bank than those that would be available from non-affiliated third parties.
 Loans to Insiders
 Loans to executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders are subject to restrictions under Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and the Federal Reserve’s implementing Regulation O (collectively, “Reg. O”). From time to time, the Bank makes loans to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders on terms permitted by Reg. O. We believe the Bank is in compliance with Reg. O and, therefore, we believe we are in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). Loans from the Bank to executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders are made in the ordinary course of business, are of a type generally made available to the public, and are on market terms no more favorable than those offered to persons not related to the Bank, except for the waiver of certain loan fees and a minor reduction in certain loan interest rates as part of an associate benefit program as allowed by Reg. O.
Change in Control
 Subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act require prior approval from the Federal Reserve and/or the FDIC for any person or company to acquire “control” of a bank or a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 
 20


25% or more of any class of voting securities, and in general is presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities. In certain cases, a company may also be presumed to have control under the BHCA if it acquires 5% or more of any class of voting securities. Control may also be deemed to exist where a person or company is found to hold “controlling influence” over a bank or bank holding company.  On June 12, 2020, members of the Gunther family and their related entities (the “Gunther 13D Group”) filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC.  In that filing, the Gunther 13D Group disclosed that it holds approximately 31% of the Company’s shares.  Insofar as the Company is aware, the Gunther 13D Group has not made filings with federal regulatory agencies with respect to its share holdings in the Company.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA and its implementing regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low-income and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. Bank regulatory agencies are required to assign and make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA as either “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance.” Such agencies consider a bank’s CRA rating when a bank submits an application to establish banking centers, merge, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of each bank involved in the merger or acquisition is reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other financial holding company. A less-than-satisfactory rating may delay, block, or impose conditions on the transaction. In its most recent CRA examination, the Bank received a rating of “satisfactory.”
In April 2018, the United States Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the Federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. On August 28, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit input and comments for the new CRA framework. Subsequently, the FDIC joined the OCC in a joint notice of proposed rulemaking in December 2019.  In May 2020, the OCC issued its final CRA rule, and in September 2020, the Federal Reserve announced its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.  The FDIC has not yet issued its own final rule, nor has it definitively indicated whether it will join the rules of the other federal regulatory authorities.  The impact of changes and amendments to the CRA program and regulatory framework on the Company is not yet known and will depend on final rule-making action taken by the FDIC.     
 Interstate Branching
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”) provides that adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks in any state. In addition, banks are permitted to establish branches in any state if that state permits the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state, although setting up a branch remains subject to applicable regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal requirements.
 Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats, having been implemented through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), the USA PATRIOT Act imposed new requirements that obligate financial institutions, such as banks, to take certain steps to monitor and control the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
 21


Among other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum:
  
• | internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to implement and maintain the bank’s compliance with all of the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the BSA, and related laws and regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a designated compliance officer;
--+---------------------------------


• | employee training;
--+-------------------


• | an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | procedures to verify the identity of each client upon the opening of accounts; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | heightened due diligence policies, procedures, and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program (“CIP”) as part of its anti-money laundering program. The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice, and record retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each client. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from clients at the time they enter into the client relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods. Furthermore, all clients must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Financial institutions are also required to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC consider an applicant’s effectiveness in combating money laundering, among other factors, in connection with an application to approve a bank merger or acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company.
 Likewise, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with the subjects of U.S. sanctions, as defined by various Executive Orders, laws, regulations, treaties, and related interpretations. OFAC assembles and provides lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring, or engaging in terrorist acts. If a bank finds a name on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report, and notify appropriate authorities.
 The Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to comply with the BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act and OFAC regulations.
 In January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”) was enacted.  The AMLA amends the BSA and is intended, in part, to modernize some of the current anti-money laundering laws.  Among other changes, the AMLA would (i) create a non-public registry to track beneficial owners of certain corporations, (ii) increase penalties for BSA and AML violations, and (iii) strengthen regulatory authority to combat financial crimes.  The implementation of various provisions of the AMLA will require further rule-making and development of other policies and measures; as such, the impact and effect on the Company is not yet known. 
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority
 Federal and state banking laws grant substantial enforcement powers to federal and state banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and “institution-affiliated parties,” such as management, employees, and agents. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. When issued by a banking regulator, cease and desist and similar orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications, or guarantees against loss. A 
 22


bank may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering regulatory agency.
 Loan Concentrations
 The FDIC has issued guidance recommending that if certain categories of commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans and acquisition, development and construction (“ADC”) loans exceed certain thresholds, then heightened risk management practices should be employed to mitigate risk. As of December 31, 2020, our ADC and CRE loans were within the thresholds set by the FDIC. We have exceeded these thresholds at times in the past and may do so again in the future. If we exceed the thresholds and do not manage the risk of our CRE and ADC loans, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, such as a requirement to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 The Bank is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines.
 Privacy and Data Security
 Federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions.  Under the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The GLBA also directed federal regulators to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying clients in the event of a security breach.
 Consumer privacy protection continues to be an area of focus for state legislatures.  Several states, including California, have recently adopted consumer privacy protection laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to safeguarding personally identifiable information.  The Company continues to monitor states in which it has a physical presence with respect to consumer privacy protection compliance obligations.  
 Other federal and state laws and regulations affect the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact clients with marketing offers.
 Like other lenders, the Bank uses credit bureau data in its underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Bank.
 Cybersecurity
 Federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC and related self-regulatory organizations, regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity that is intended to enhance cybersecurity risk management among financial institutions. A financial institution is expected to establish lines of defense and to ensure that its risk management processes also address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to a cyberattack.
 On December 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, and the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would impose new notification requirements for significant cybersecurity incidents. If adopted without substantial change, the proposed rule would require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator promptly, and not later than 36 hours after, the discovery of such incidents termed “computer-
 23


security incidents” that are “notification incidents.”  This proposed rule would be in addition to existing statutory and regulatory obligations the Bank has for notification of security incidents, including those prescribed under the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards, BSA, and state laws and regulations.
 To control cyber-security risk, we maintain active information security programs that are designed to conform with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) guidance. These information security programs are aligned with our operational risks and are overseen by executive management, and the Board. These programs involve the assessment of risks, continual monitoring and review of threats, the evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to mitigate risks, and review of incident response plans for each identified threat. We also utilize appropriate cybersecurity insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk.
 Further, we recognize our role in the overall industry, and have adopted a comprehensive model based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cyber Security Framework. We also fully participate in the federally recognized financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Digital technology is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond our risk control thresholds. Although we invest substantial time and resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to eliminate this risk completely.
 We believe that effective management of operational risk, defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events, plays a major role in both the level and the stability of our profitability. We have enterprise risk oversight processes in place to identify, assess, control, monitor, and report on operational risks, all of which support our goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen our performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses incurred.
 Consumer Laws and Regulations
 The Bank is also subject to a number of other federal and state consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the FCRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when offering consumer financial products and services.
 Rulemaking authority for most federal consumer-financial-protection laws rests with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate the prohibition on UDAAP, certain aspects of these standards are untested, and thus it is currently not possible to predict how the CFPB will exercise this authority.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. The rules also impose both underwriting standards and limits on the terms, including pricing, of such loans. In 2014, the CFPB adopted regulations that combine mortgage disclosures required by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and its implementing Regulation X, and the Truth-in-Lending Act and its implementing Regulation Z. This new disclosure scheme required mortgage lenders, such as the Bank, to substantially revise their loan-origination and disclosure systems in order to comply with the new regulations. The Bank has implemented necessary modifications in order to meet these requirements. Portions of a significant expansion of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and its implementing Regulation C took effect in 2018.

Other Dodd-Frank Act Reforms
 Volcker Rule
 The Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, and their affiliates, such as the Company, from (i) engaging in “proprietary trading,” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds, or covered funds, in each case subject to certain limited exceptions. The final rules impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities.
 In May 2018, the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the Volcker Rule released a proposal to revise the Volcker Rule. The proposal would tailor the Volcker Rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity, revise the definition of trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and modify the information companies are required to provide the federal agencies. If adopted, the proposed changes to the definition of a trading account would likely expand the scope of investing and trading activities subject to the Volcker Rule’s restrictions.
 In October 2019, regulators finalized amendments, effective on January 1, 2020, and specified a compliance date of January 1, 2021, to regulations implementing the Volcker Rule.  Compliance requirements are based on the size and scope of a banking entity’s trading activities.  Certain amendments were made to definitions, requirements and exemptions. In June 2020, regulators finalized amendments, which became effective October 1, 2020, to the Volcker Rule’s regulations relating to covered funds, which, inter alia, (i) established new exclusions from covered fund status for certain types of investment vehicles, (ii) adjusted the eligibility criteria for certain existing exclusions, and (iii) clarified certain provisions governing investments in and transactions and relationships involving covered funds. Under these amendments, banking entities are not required to treat investments alongside covered funds as investments in covered funds subject to certain limitations, so long as certain conditions are satisfied. 
 The Company continues to review the scope of any compliance program that may be required but is presently of the view that the impact of the Volcker Rule will not be material to its business operations.
 Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to include, at least once every three years, a separate non-binding “say-on-pay” vote in their proxy statement by which shareholders may vote on the compensation of the public company’s named executive officers. In addition, if such public companies are involved in a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, or if they propose to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, shareholders have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction. Other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may affect our corporate governance. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt rules requiring all exchange-traded companies to adopt claw-back policies for incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of accounting restatements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements. 
Future Legislative and Regulatory Developments
 Congress and the Utah Legislature enact or amend legislation from time to time.  Regulatory agencies frequently modify or create new regulations and guidance. Such acts and modifications or new regulation and guidance may change the environment in which the Company and the Bank operate in substantive, substantial, and unpredictable ways. We cannot determine the ultimate impact that potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations and guidance with respect thereto, would have on the Company or the Bank’s financial condition, operations, or performance results. 
State Corporate Law Restrictions
 The Company and the Bank are Utah corporations subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Utah corporate law. For example, applicable state law includes limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors; distributions to shareholders; transactions involving 
 25


directors, officers, or interested shareholders; maintenance of books, records, and minutes; and observance of certain corporate formalities.
 Effects of Government Monetary Policy
 Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve can and does implement national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation, combatting recession, and facilitating the national debt. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
