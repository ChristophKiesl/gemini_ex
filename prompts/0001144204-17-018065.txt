This market consists principally of customers who are OEM manufacturers of industrial, medical, and R&D lasers which the Company serves as an OEM supplier of standard and custom optical components and laser accessories, as well as a number of smaller customers in other markets that are not currently large enough to list individually.
 
Sales in this market were lower in 2016 as a percentage of sales, compared to 2015, from 19.2% to 16.1%, or a decrease of $445,000. This was mainly attributable to lower sales to one large health sciences customer and another large customer in the telecom industry.
 
Universities and National Laboratories
 
These sales consist of product sales directly to researchers at various educational and research institutions and through distributors into that market. Sales to customers within the University and National Laboratories market consist primarily of the Company’s legacy systems, Pockels’ cells and related repairs. Sales in 2016 increased by $205,000, or 22.4%and as a percentage of total sales to 11.5% compared to 8.7% in 2015. This was primarily attributable to increased business in 2016 from one National Lab that received government funding for a program which utilized our products and an increase in order volume from a second National Lab customer.
Major Customers
 
The Company’s sales have historically been concentrated within a small number of customers, although the top customers have varied from year to year.
 
In 2016, the Company’s sales to its top three customers accounted for 25.7% of sales. This included sales to a division of a major U.S. defense industry corporation that manufactures electro-optical systems for U.S. and foreign governments. These sales accounted for 10.5% of 2016 sales to this customer that were comparable to the prior year sales volume. Two other customers were foreign-based manufacturers of process control and metrology equipment whose sales represented 8.8% and 6.4% of sales, respectively.
 
The same three customers represented 10.3%, 8.3% and 6.7 %, of sales in 2015, respectively.
 
Sales to the Company’s top five customers represented approximately 37.8% and 42.6% of sales, in 2016 and 2015, respectively. All these customers are OEM manufacturers either within the defense, process control and metrology or laser systems sector.
 
Export Sales
 
The Company’s export sales are primarily to customers in Europe, Israel, Asia and Japan and amounted to approximately 23.1%, and 25.2% of product sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Long-Term Contracts 
 
Certain of the Company’s agreements with customers provide for periodic deliveries at fixed prices over a long period of time. In such cases, the Company negotiates to obtain firm price commitments, as well as cash advances from its customers for the purchase of the materials necessary to fulfill the order.
Marketing and Business Development
 
The Company markets its products domestically, through the coordinated efforts of the sales, marketing and customer service teams.
 
The Company has moved towards a strategy of utilizing these combined sales and marketing resources for cross-selling all products across all business lines. This strategy is well suited to the diverse and fragmented markets that utilize photonic technologies.

The Company’s order backlog at December 31, 2016 was $6,255,000. The Company’s order backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $5,195,000.
 
We anticipate shipping a majority of the present backlog during fiscal year 2017. However, our backlog at any given date may consist of orders with delivery schedules that extend beyond twelve months into the future.
Competition
 
Within each product category in which the Company’s business units are active, there is competition.
 
Changes in the photonics industry have had an effect on suppliers of custom optics. As end users have introduced products requiring large volumes of optical components, suppliers have responded either by staying small and carving out niche product areas, or by ramping up manufacturing capacity and modernizing their manufacturing methods to meet higher volume production rates. Additionally, the availability of an increasingly large variety of inventoried inexpensive catalog optics has led some OEM manufacturers to “design in” these low-cost solutions rather than utilizing custom designed and manufactured products.
 
Competition for the Company’s crystal devices and instrumentation is more limited and the Company’s laser devices are considered to be high quality and generally offer a combination of features not available elsewhere. As a result of the Company’s in-house crystal growth capability, this area of the business is highly vertically integrated, providing a competitive advantage over other suppliers.
 
For crystal products, the market is highly competitive. Many of the Company’s competitors who supply non-linear optical crystals are located overseas, and can offer significantly reduced pricing for some crystal materials. On many occasions, the quality of the crystal component drives the ultimate performance of the component or instrument into which it is installed. Quality and technical support are considered to be valuable attributes for a crystal supplier by some, but not all, OEM customers.
 
Our metal optics product line has several key competitors who are larger and better equipped to compete on high volume work. There are also several large and small competitors who compete with our products on large form factor optics. The Company has made recent inroads within this competitive landscape, and is building brand awareness in the marketplace.
 
Although price is a principal factor in many product categories, competition is also based on product design, performance, customer confidence, quality, delivery, and customer service. Based on its performance to date, the Company believes that it can continue to compete successfully, although no assurances can be given in this regard.
 
Employees
 
As of the close of business on March 23, 2017, the Company had 63 employees.
 
Patents and Licenses
 
The Company mainly relies on its manufacturing and technological expertise, know-how and trade secrets in addition to its patents, to maintain its competitive position in the industry. The Company takes precautionary and protective measures to safeguard its technical design and manufacturing processes. The Company executes nondisclosure agreements with its employees and, where appropriate, with its customers, suppliers and other associates.
Regulation
 
Foreign sales of certain of the Company’s products to certain countries may require export licenses from the United States Department of Commerce. Such licenses are obtained when required. All requested export licenses of Inrad Optics products have been granted or deemed not-required.
 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) governs much of the Company’s domestic defense sector business, and the Company is capable of handling its customers’ technical information under these regulations. Inrad Optics, Inc. is registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and utilizes a supplier base of similarly registered companies.
 
There are no other federal regulations or any unusual state regulations that directly affect the sale of the Company’s products other than those environmental compliance regulations that generally affect companies engaged in manufacturing operations in New Jersey.
