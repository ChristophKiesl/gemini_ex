Company Overview
​
We are the leader in pharmaceutically-produced transdermal cannabinoid therapies for rare and near-rare neuropsychiatric disorders. We are committed to improving the lives of patients and their families living with severe, chronic health conditions including Fragile X syndrome, or FXS, autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, or 22q. 
​
Cannabinoids are a class of compounds derived from Cannabis plants. The two primary cannabinoids contained in Cannabis are cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that cannabidiol may have positive effects on treating behavioral symptoms of FXS, ASD and 22q. 
​
We are currently developing Zygel, the first and only pharmaceutically-produced cannabidiol formulated as a permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery and manufactured without the presence of THC, which is patent protected through 2030. Five additional patents expiring in 2038 are directed to methods of use relating to Zygel, including methods of treating FXS and ASD. 
​
In preclinical animal studies, Zygel’s permeation enhancer increased delivery of cannabidiol through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system. These preclinical studies suggest increased bioavailability, consistent plasma levels and the avoidance of first-pass liver metabolism of cannabidiol when delivered transdermally. In addition, an in vitro study published in Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research in April 2016 demonstrated that cannabidiol is degraded to THC (the major psychoactive cannabinoid in Cannabis) in an acidic environment such as the stomach. As a result, we believe such degradation may lead to increased psychoactive effects if cannabidiol is delivered orally. These effects may be avoided with the transdermal delivery of Zygel, which maintains cannabidiol in a neutral pH. 
​
Zygel is being developed as a clear gel with once- or twice-daily dosing and is targeting treatment of behavioral symptoms of FXS, ASD and 22q. We have been granted orphan drug designations from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission, or the EC, for the use of cannabidiol for the treatment of FXS. We have also been granted orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of 22q. In May 2019, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with FXS. The FDA’s Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development of drugs intended to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs and can lead to expedited review by the FDA in order to get new important drugs to the patient earlier.

Clinical Development Programs
​
Our clinical programs for Zygel include ongoing and planned clinical trials evaluating Zygel in the treatment of behavioral symptoms of FXS, ASD and 22q.
​
* FDA Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation; EU Orphan Drug designation
** FDA Orphan Drug designation
​
As of February 22, 2022, the Zygel safety database across all clinical studies conducted by us includes data from 916 volunteers and patients. Across these clinical studies, Zygel has been well-tolerated with a safety profile that has been consistent across our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. 
​
FXS
CONNECT-FX Trial 
​
In June 2020, we announced results of our CONNECT-FX clinical trial, a multi-national randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents ages three through 17 years who have full mutation of the FMR1 gene. While Zygel did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo in the primary endpoint of improvement in the Social Avoidance subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Community FXS, or ABC-CFXS, a pre-planned ad hoc analysis of the most severely impacted patients in the trial, as defined by patients having at least 90% methylation (“highly methylated”) of the impacted FMR1 gene, demonstrated that those patients receiving Zygel achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of improvement at 12 weeks of treatment in the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS compared to placebo. We performed a subsequent analysis of the CONNECT-FX population within those patients having 100% or complete methylation of the impacted FMR1 gene, which demonstrated that these completely methylated patients receiving Zygel similarly achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of improvement at 12 weeks of treatment in the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS compared to placebo. 
​
RECONNECT Trial
​
In September 2021, we announced that we had initiated our RECONNECT (A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multiple-Center, Efficacy and Safety Study of ZYN002 Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Fragile X Syndrome) trial, a pivotal, multi-national, confirmatory Phase 3 trial of Zygel in patients 

8



with FXS. The trial is designed to confirm the positive results observed in a population of responders in our CONNECT-FX trial. 
​
RECONNECT is an 18-week trial that is expected to enroll approximately 200 children and adolescents, aged three through 17 years, at approximately 25 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Approximately 160 of the patients enrolled will have complete (100%) methylation of their FMR1 gene and approximately 40 patients will have partial methylation of their FMR1 gene. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either Zygel or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by gender, methylation status and weight. 
​
The primary endpoint for the trial will be the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale in patients who have complete methylation of their FMR1 gene. The ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale is the same primary endpoint used in the CONNECT-FX trial. 
​
Key secondary efficacy endpoints include: (i) the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Irritability subscale in patients who have complete methylation of their FMR1 gene; (ii) the percent of patients with any improvement on the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CaGI-C) at the end of the treatment period for Social Interactions among patients with complete methylation of the FMR1 gene; (iii) the percent of patients rated as improved on the Clinical Global Impression- Improvement (CGI-I) scale among patients with complete methylation (100%) of the FMR1 gene; and (iv) the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale among all randomized patients (complete and partial methylation of the FMR1 gene). 
​
Top-line results for the RECONNECT trial are expected in the second half of 2023. All patients who complete dosing in the RECONNECT trial will be eligible to enroll in our ongoing open-label extension trial.
​
ASD
​
Phase 2 BRIGHT Trial 
​
In May 2020, we reported positive top-line results of our Phase 2 BRIGHT clinical trial, a 14-week, open-label clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ASD. Patients treated with Zygel demonstrated statistically significant improvement at week 14 compared to baseline for each Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Community (ABC-C) subscale (Irritability, Inappropriate Speech, Stereotypy, Social Withdrawal and Hyperactivity). The results of the other efficacy assessments were consistent with the results demonstrated in the ABC-C. In September 2021, we reported additional safety and efficacy data from our BRIGHT trial for the 18 patients that continued from week 14 through a longer term, 38-week treatment period, which we refer to as Period 2. In the 18 patients who completed treatment through the 38-week treatment period, statistically significant improvements compared to baseline were sustained in all efficacy measures.
​
Phase 3 Program
​
We plan to advance our clinical program in ASD with two Phase 3 trials, the first of which is expected to start in the second half of 2022. We are finalizing the Phase 3 trial protocol and will submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA prior to commencing the pivotal program. In 2021, we received guidance from the FDA that included an agreement on utilizing the irritability subscale of the ABC-C as the primary endpoint to support an indication for the treatment of irritability in ASD. This is the same endpoint that was utilized in the BRIGHT trial and the same primary endpoint utilized in the pivotal trials for the two existing FDA approved treatments for ASD.
​
22q
​
Phase 2 INSPIRE Trial 
​
In May 2019, we initiated our open-label Phase 2 INSPIRE clinical trial, a 14-week, open-label clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for treatment of behavioral symptoms of 22q. Recruitment into the INSPIRE trial had been delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 and resulting significant travel restrictions in Australia 

9



and, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we added an additional U.S. clinical trial site to the INSPIRE trial to assist in the completion of enrollment. In February 2022, we announced that we have completed enrollment of the INSPIRE trial, consisting of 20 patients (ages 4 through 15), and we expect to have top-line data by mid-year 2022. We plan to move forward in 22q as an orphan designated indication, subject to results from the INSPIRE trial and subsequent discussion with the FDA on the regulatory path forward.
​
Impact of COVID-19
​
We continue to closely monitor the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its potential impact on our clinical development plans, patient recruitment and overall trial timelines going forward. In response to the impact of COVID-19, for our current clinical development programs, we implemented multiple measures consistent with the FDA’s guidance on the conduct of clinical trials of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote site monitoring and patient visits using telemedicine where needed and appropriate, direct-to-patient drug shipments, and local study-related clinical laboratory collection. 
​
Cannabidiol Science Overview 
​
The endocannabinoid system includes the endocannabinoids, primarily 2-arachidonoylglycerol, or 2-AG, and anandamide, or AEA, and the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. The disruption of the endocannabinoid system may play a core role in the underlying pathophysiology of FXS and ASD. 
​
Cannabidiol modulates the endocannabinoid system by inhibiting the metabolism (breakdown) of 2-AG and AEA. This inhibition is thought to result in increased 2-AG and AEA availability, greater CB1 and CB2 activation, reduced excitatory signaling and increased synaptic plasticity. Cannabidiol may restore homeostatic mechanisms in patients with endocannabinoid system dysfunction. The effect of cannabidiol on the endocannabinoid system is the scientific basis for the use of cannabidiol in the treatment of FXS, ASD and 22q. Cannabidiol may also treat the neuropsychiatric symptoms of these conditions due to its activity as an agonist at 5-HT1A and an antagonist at GPR55 receptors.
​
Clinical and preclinical data suggest that cannabidiol may have positive effects on treating FXS, ASD and 22q. Patients with FXS, ASD and 22q share several of the same behavioral symptoms, which may be treatable with cannabidiol. Clinical data also suggest that cannabidiol has a very high therapeutic index. Interest in cannabinoid therapeutics has increased significantly over the past several years as preclinical and clinical data has emerged highlighting the potential efficacy and safety benefits of cannabinoid therapeutics. Epidiolex®, a sesame oil liquid formulation of highly concentrated cannabidiol, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with specific epilepsies, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, or LGS, and Dravet Syndrome, or DS, in 2018 and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, or TSC, in 2020. The cannabinoid therapeutics market is expected to grow significantly due to the potential benefits these products may provide over existing therapies.

Product Candidates
​
Zygel – Cannabidiol Transdermal Gel
​
Zygel is the first and only pharmaceutically-produced cannabidiol formulated as a permeation-enhanced gel for transdermal delivery (see Figure 1) and manufactured without the presence of THC, and the formulation is patent protected through 2030.
​
Figure 1 — Chemical structure and transdermal gel delivery of cannabidiol. 
​

​
Zygel is being developed as a clear gel that is designed to provide consistent, controlled drug delivery with convenient dosing. Because cannabidiol is virtually insoluble in water, we use a patent protected formulation containing ethanol and propylene glycol as solubilizing agents and Transcutol ® HP as a permeation enhancer. All excipients in the gel have been classified as Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS, and have been used in transdermal products previously approved by the FDA.

The permeation enhancer in Zygel increases the delivery of cannabidiol through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system.

Transdermal delivery allows the cannabidiol in Zygel to avoid stomach acid degradation and the first-pass liver metabolism that occurs with oral or oral mucosal delivery methods. Drugs applied transdermally are absorbed across the skin into the systemic circulation, enabling the potential to have a consistent absorption with increased bioavailability.

Development of Zygel for the Treatment of Behavioral Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome
​
FXS Overview
​
FXS is a rare genetic condition that causes intellectual disability, anxiety disorders, behavioral and learning challenges and various physical characteristics. The impairment can range from learning disabilities to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. FXS is the leading known cause of both inherited intellectual disability and ASD. Patients with FXS may exhibit autism-like symptoms including anxiety, social impairment and social avoidance (seeks isolation from others, does not want to be with other children and avoids all types of new social engagements) and restricted/repetitive behaviors. Currently, there are no known cures or approved therapies indicated for the treatment of FXS or its symptoms. Special education and symptomatic treatments for anxiety and irritability are employed to lessen the burden of illness. Based on the 2020 U.S. Census and the National Fragile X Foundation, or NFXF, FXS prevalence is estimated at approximately 78,000 patients in the United States. According to the NFXF, FXS affects 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females of all races and ethnic groups. We believe that approximately 60% of all patients with FXS have a completely methylated FMR1 gene.


11



We believe Zygel may provide an effective treatment for patients with FXS that have a completely methylated FMR1 gene based on its capacity to interact with the endocannabinoid system, which is compromised in patients with FXS. The endocannabinoid system facilitates synaptic homeostasis and plasticity resulting in feedback inhibition of neuronal signaling. Endocannabinoid system-mediated feedback inhibition and synaptic plasticity are thought to be disrupted in FXS due to absence of FMRP when the FRM1 gene is completely methylated. Cannabidiol may help restore synaptic homeostasis in FXS. This modulation is the scientific basis for the use of cannabidiol in the treatment of FXS. We anticipate Zygel may be used as first line therapy to treat patients suffering from behavioral symptoms of FXS.
​
FAB-C
​
In September 2017, we reported the results for our open-label exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zygel in children with FXS, which we refer to as the FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) trial. The primary endpoint for the trial was the change in the total score of the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale, or ADAMS, from baseline to week 12. The ADAMS is a 28-item scale designed to assess general anxiety, social avoidance, compulsive behavior, manic/hyperactive behavior and depressed mood. It has been validated in patients with FXS. Twenty patients (3:1 males) ages six through 17 years (mean = 10.7) with FXS, as confirmed by molecular documentation of full mutation of the FMR1 gene, were enrolled in the open-label FAB-C study. Zygel was added on to other medications being administered. The first six weeks of the study were designed to titrate dosing in patients. Dosing was initiated at 50 mg daily and could be increased to 250 mg daily. Weeks seven through 12 of the study were a maintenance period where patients were treated at the dose established at week six. At the completion of the study, patients could enter an open-label extension study for up to 12 months. 

The FAB-C trial successfully met its primary endpoint, achieving a 46% improvement (p<0.0001) in the total score of ADAMS at week 12 compared to baseline. 
​
Results for the ADAMS at week 12 are summarized as follows: 
​
​
Zygel also achieved clinically meaningful improvements in all measures of the ABC-CFXS, which addresses the key behavioral symptoms of FXS including social avoidance, repetitive movements and socially unresponsive behaviors. The study achieved statistical significance across all ABC-CFXS subscales compared to baseline.
​

Results from the ABC-CFXS at week 12 are summarized as follows: 
​
​
We evaluated multiple other secondary endpoints including CGI-I, the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, or PARS-R, Visual Analog Scales for Anxiety, Hyperactivity and Tantrum/Mood Lability, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior III, a Quality of Sleep measurement and the Pediatric Quality of Life, or PedsQL™. The results of the ABC-CFXS and other secondary endpoints reinforce the results demonstrated in the ADAMS. 
​
Zygel was shown to be well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with data from earlier clinical trials and our other Phase 2 clinical trials for Zygel. All adverse events were considered mild to moderate and no serious adverse events were reported. No patient experienced drug-related gastrointestinal, or GI, events during the 12-week treatment period, and no THC was detected in the plasma. Of the 18 patients who completed the study, 13 enrolled in the open-label extension and 10 patients are still being treated with Zygel as of February 21, 2022. These patients have now been on Zygel between 61 and 64 months.
​
We also collected 24-month open label clinical data from the FAB-C trial regarding the long-term impact of Zygel on emotional and behavioral symptoms of FXS. The statistically significant improvements in the core emotional and behavioral symptoms of FXS versus baseline as measured by the ABC-CFXS were sustained through 24 months of treatment. In the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS, patients completing 24 months of treatment with Zygel experienced a 74% improvement in social avoidance behaviors versus baseline, compared to a 58% improvement at three months of treatment. Both results are statistically significant compared to baseline. Zygel was well tolerated in this study, no serious adverse events were reported and no clinically meaningful trends in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or ECG, or clinical safety laboratories, including liver function tests, were observed.

​
CONNECT-FX
​
In July 2018, we initiated our CONNECT-FX (Clinical study of Cannabidiol (CBD) in Children and Adolescents with Fragile X) clinical trial, a multi-national randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents ages three through 17 years who have full mutation of the FMR1 gene. In June 2020, we announced that Zygel did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo in the primary endpoint of improvement in the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS. Zygel also did not demonstrate statistical significance versus placebo in the three key secondary endpoints, which were the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the Irritability subscale score of the ABC-CFXS, the Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic subscale score of the ABC-CFXS and CGI-I. 
​
We performed a pre-planned ad hoc analysis of the most severely impacted patients in the trial as defined by patients having at least 90% methylation, which we refer to as highly methylated, of the impacted FMR1 gene, which accounted for 80% of the patients enrolled in the CONNECT-FX trial. This analysis demonstrated those patients receiving Zygel achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of improvement compared to placebo (p=0.020) in the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS at 12 weeks of treatment, and the results of the Caregiver Global Impression – Change survey for these patients also showed a broad shift toward global improvement from baseline to week 12 for highly methylated patients with three of the four behavioral domains (social avoidance and isolation, irritable and disruptive behaviors, and social interactions) showing a statistically significant change in favor of patients on Zygel and the fourth domain (overall behavior) trending toward significance. 
​
Following completion of the CONNECT-FX trial, we performed a subsequent analysis of the CONNECT-FX population within those patients having 100% methylation, which we refer to as completely methylated, of the impacted FMR1 gene to evaluate the effect of Zygel versus placebo within this patient population. The completely methylated patients participating in CONNECT-FX consisted of 137 of 212 (65%) in the intent to treat population, with one patient excluded from the efficacy analysis due to lack of a post-baseline efficacy measure. The analysis demonstrated that these completely methylated patients receiving Zygel similarly achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of improvement compared to placebo (p=0.027) in the Social Avoidance subscale of the ABC-CFXS at 12 weeks of treatment. 
​

The data collected from the CONNECT-FX trial in patients with a completely methylated FMR1 gene across the primary and key secondary endpoints used in the CONNECT-FX trial can be summarized in the following chart:
​
​
​
Based on what we learned from the CONNECT-FX trial and discussions with the FDA, we have modified certain aspects of the CONNECT-FX trial design into the trial design for our confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial in FXS, which we refer to as our RECONNECT (A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multiple-Center, Efficacy and Safety Study of ZYN002 Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Fragile X Syndrome) clinical trial. These modifications include assessing the primary efficacy outcomes for patients with complete methylation of the FMR1 gene, extending the length of the trial from 14 to 18 weeks, adding a third weight-based dose for the heaviest patients in the trial and making the trial more patient-friendly through virtual visits, fewer assessments being administered and reduced frequency of lab and ECG tests. 
​
RECONNECT 
​
In September 2021, we initiated our RECONNECT trial, a pivotal, multi-national, confirmatory Phase 3 trial of Zygel in patients with FXS. The trial is designed to confirm the positive results observed in the pre-planned, ad hoc analysis of the highly methylated patients and the subsequent analysis of completely methylated patients who participated in our CONNECT-FX trial.
​
RECONNECT is an 18-week trial that is expected to enroll approximately 200 children and adolescents, aged three through 17 years, at approximately 25 clinical sites in the United States, Australia, the UK and Ireland. Approximately 160 of the patients enrolled will have complete (100%) methylation of their FMR1 gene and approximately 40 patients 

15



will have partial methylation of their FMR1 gene. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either Zygel or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by gender, methylation status and weight.
​
The primary endpoint for the trial will be the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale in patients who have complete methylation of their FMR1 gene. Change from baseline in the ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale is the same primary endpoint used in the CONNECT-FX trial.
​
Key secondary efficacy endpoints include: the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Irritability subscale in patients who have complete methylation of their FMR1 gene; the percent of patients with any improvement on the CaGI-C at the end of the treatment period for Social Interactions among patients with complete methylation of the FMR1 gene; the percent of patients rated as improved on the CGI-I scale among patients with complete methylation (100%) of the FMR1 gene; and the change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the ABC-CFXS Social Avoidance subscale among all randomized patients (complete and partial methylation of the FMR1 gene). 
​
Top-line results for the RECONNECT trial are expected in the second-half of 2023. All patients who complete dosing in the RECONNECT trial will be eligible to enroll in our ongoing open-label extension trial, which currently includes patients who participated in our FAB-C and CONNECT-FX trials.
​
We received written scientific advice from the EMA providing clarity and guidance on the clinical and regulatory requirements for the submission of a Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, in the European Union, or EU, for Zygel for the treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with FXS. Based on the EMA’s scientific advice, we believe that the successful completion of the current development program for Zygel in FXS will satisfy the requirements of an MAA in the EU. 
​
Development of Zygel for Treatment of ASD
​
ASD Overview
​
ASD is a developmental disability affecting approximately 1.4 million pediatric and adolescent patients between the ages of three and 17 in the U.S. It is a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, diagnosis, which includes autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It is characterized by anxiety, repetitive patterns of behavior, impairments in social communication including verbal and non-verbal communication, higher rates of irritability and aggression, and deficits in developing, understanding and maintaining relationships. 
​
Despite high awareness and advocacy efforts, the medical need in ASD is significant and unmet. In the United States, new estimates published in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report confirm an increasing trend in the prevalence of ASD, with approximately 1 in 44 eight-year-old children (or approximately 1.4 million children in total, if extrapolated to include children ages 3 to 17 years) identified with ASD. Despite the accelerating rate of diagnosis, only two agents, risperidone and aripiprazole, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ASD symptoms. Both of these agents are antipsychotics and carry a significant side effect profile. The annual cost of care associated with ASD in the United States is expected to grow to $461 billion by 2025.
​
Recent studies suggest that ASD may be associated with a disruption in the endocannabinoid system, which modulates many cellular functions and molecular pathways that are altered in ASD, including GABAergic imbalance, glutamatergic transmission, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation and altered energy metabolism. Altered anandamide (an endocannabinoid) signaling may contribute to ASD-related social and communication impairments. Clinical and anecdotal data show improvement in irritability, social avoidance and anxiety in children receiving treatment with cannabidiol. Exogenous cannabidiol may modulate the endocannabinoid system and improve certain autism-related behaviors. 
​

Phase 2 Clinical Trial
​
In May 2020, we reported positive top-line results of the Phase 2 BRIGHT (An Open-Label Tolerability and Efficacy Study of ZYN002 Administered as a Transdermal Gel to Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder) clinical trial, a 14-week, open label clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ASD. The trial evaluated multiple efficacy assessments, including the ABC-C, Autism Parenting Stress Index, Patient Reported Anxiety Scale – Autism Spectrum Disorder, or PRAS-ASD, Autism Impact Measure, or AIM, Clinical Global Impression – Severity, or CGI-S, and the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement, or CGI-I, scale. Patients treated with Zygel demonstrated statistically significant improvement at week 14 compared to baseline for each ABC-C subscale (Irritability, Inappropriate Speech, Stereotypy, Social Withdrawal, and Hyperactivity). Patients receiving Zygel achieved statistically significant caregiver-reported improvements compared to baseline across all subscales of the AIM: Atypical behavior (p<0.001), Communication (p<0.001), Peer Interaction (p<0.001), Repetitive Behavior (p<0.001), and Social Reciprocity (p=0.0053). In addition, statistically significant improvements compared to baseline were observed at week 14 of treatment with Zygel in the Autism Parenting Stress Index (p<0.0001). The results of the other efficacy assessments are consistent with the results demonstrated in the ABC-C. 
​
The data derived from the BRIGHT trial can be summarized as follows:

​
In September 2021, we reported data from Period 2 of the Phase 2 BRIGHT trial describing tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for the 18 patients that continued through a longer, 38-week treatment period. Eighteen of the 27 patients that completed week 14 demonstrated ≥35% improvement in the ABC-C Irritability subscale at week 14 and were allowed to continue treatment for an additional 24-week period. In these 18 patients who completed treatment through the 38-week treatment period, Zygel showed improvement in all the ABC-C subscale scores (51% to 61% across domains; P<0.0001), as well as improvements in the Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale-ASD score (42%; P<0.0001), the Autism Parenting Stress Index (40%; P<0.0001) and the Autism Impact Measure (19% to 36% across domains; P≤0.0008), relative to baseline. Zygel was well tolerated throughout both treatment periods in this study, no serious adverse events 

17



were reported and no clinically meaningful trends in vital signs, ECG or clinical safety laboratories, including liver function tests, were observed.
​
​
In 2021, we discussed data supporting the potential efficacy of Zygel in ASD, including the results of the Phase 2 BRIGHT trial, with the FDA. The guidance from the FDA included agreement on utilizing change from baseline in the Irritability subscale of the ABC-C as the primary endpoint to support an indication for the treatment of irritability in ASD. This is the same endpoint utilized in the BRIGHT trial and the same primary endpoint utilized in the pivotal trials for the two existing FDA approved treatments for ASD. We plan to advance our clinical program in ASD with two Phase 3 trials, the first of which is expected to start in the second-half of 2022. We are finalizing the Phase 3 study protocol and will submit an IND application to the FDA prior to commencing the pivotal program. 
​
Development of Zygel for Treatment of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q)
​
22q Overview
​
22q is the second most common genetic disorder behind Down Syndrome. It is a rare disorder, affecting approximately 83,000 patients in the U.S, which results from a microdeletion occurring on the long arm of chromosome 22 at a location designated q11.2. There are no drugs with an approved indication for the treatment of 22q. 
 ​
22q is considered a mid-line condition, which is a defect or condition that occurs on the anterior portion of a body, usually in the middle or center of the body, with physical symptoms including characteristic palate abnormalities, heart defects, immune dysfunction and esophageal/GI issues. There are two primary stages of 22q patient management. During infancy, doctors address the acute physical concerns, such as anomalies of heart and palate, with surgery. Once the physical concerns are stabilized, the focus shifts to managing the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric illnesses (e.g., anxiety disorders, ASD) and learning disabilities are common in this patient population. The syndrome is associated with increased anxiety, withdrawn behavior and social interaction problems. Early onset of these core neuropsychiatric symptoms may disrupt development and quality of life in these patients and may heighten the risk of later psychotic disorders. Psychoses, like schizophrenia, are common in this population; there is a 25-fold increased risk of developing schizophrenia among people with 22q compared to the lifetime risk in the general population. Early control of anxiety may delay the development of such psychoses. 
​
Cannabidiol may treat the neuropsychiatric symptoms of 22q due to its activity as an agonist at 5HT1A receptors, an antagonist at GPR55 receptors, and a modulator of the endocannabinoid system. 
​

18



Phase 2 Clinical Trial
​
In May 2019, we initiated our open-label Phase 2 INSPIRE (Assessing the Impact of Zygel [Transdermal Cannabidiol Gel] on Pediatric Behavioral and Emotional Symptoms of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome) clinical trial, a 14-week, open label clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Zygel for treatment of behavioral symptoms of 22q. Recruitment into the INSPIRE trial had been delayed due to the impact of COVID-19 and resulting significant travel restrictions in Australia and, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we added an additional U.S. clinical trial site to the INSPIRE trial to assist in the completion of enrollment. In February 2022, we announced that we have completed enrollment of the INSPIRE trial, consisting of 20 patients (ages 4 through 15), and we expect to have top-line data mid-year 2022.

We previously evaluated Zygel targeting the reduction of seizures in patients with a heterogeneous group of rare and ultra-rare epilepsies known as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, or DEE. This clinical program consisted of our Phase 2 BELIEVE clinical trial, a six-month, open-label, multi-dose clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zygel in children and adolescents (ages three through 17 years) with DEE, the results of which were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open in an article entitled “Safety and tolerability of transdermal cannabidiol gel in children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: A nonrandomized controlled trial.” Previous discussions with the FDA regarding the clinical pathway for Zygel in DEE indicated that selecting a specific DEE syndrome would be required for a pediatric indication in epilepsy rather than evaluating improvements in certain seizure types across all DEEs. During 2021, we evaluated individual syndromes and conducted a feasibility study. Based on our research and strategic prioritization, the decision was made to maintain focus on other important neuropsychiatric behavioral conditions and not to pursue further development in DEE at this time. 

​
Intellectual Property
​
The success of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
​

● | obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary compounds, technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | prosecute our patent applications and defend our issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------

​

● | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We internally developed our intellectual property related to our product candidates. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for our product candidates, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses, by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries.
​
As of February 22, 2022, we own a total of 16 issued U.S. patents and 11 pending U.S. applications. The U.S. patents will expire between 2026 through 2038. We have already obtained additional patent term for some of the issued patents to compensate us for delays at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, under the patent term adjustment laws.
​
In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we own 162 corresponding foreign issued patents and 60 corresponding foreign patent applications.
 ​
Our Zygel patent portfolio currently consists of seven issued patents in the United States, and five pending United States patent applications. There are seven issued patents in Canada, the United Kingdom and multiple countries in the European Union, and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications. The issued patents claim the permeation enhanced formulation of Zygel and methods of use relating to Zygel, including methods of treating FXS and 

19



ASD. Pending applications include claims directed to methods of treating FXS, ASD and 22q. The issued patents will expire between 2026 and 2038. We anticipate that any patents issued from our pending U.S. applications or pending PCT applications will expire between 2038 and 2041.
​
The rest of our patent portfolio relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to other potential indications and product candidates. 
​
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
​
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.
​
Manufacturing
​
The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in our product candidates are synthesized by contract manufacturers. Zygel is manufactured and filled into unit of use sachets by contract manufacturers. 
​
We selected our contract manufacturers for their specific competencies in manufacturing, product design and materials. FDA regulations require that products be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Our key suppliers currently meet cGMPs and we believe have sufficient capacities to meet our projected product requirements through early commercialization.
​
Commercial Operations
​
Our Vice President of Commercial and Business Development is responsible for pre-commercialization activities, including global market analysis, strategic optimization and value development associated with our product candidates, as well as business development activities as we evaluate partnering options. However, we do not currently have a fully integrated organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We currently plan to commercialize Zygel in the United States and to enter into collaborations or licensing and co-promotion agreements with third parties for the commercialization of our products in other territories. As we plan to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that Zygel will be approved.
​
Competition
​
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic institutions; governmental agencies; and public and private research institutions. Successfully developed and commercialized product candidates must compete not only with existing therapies, but also with agents that may become available in the future.
​
We are currently studying Zygel in patients with FXS, ASD and 22q.
​

20



FXS
​
There are no drugs approved for the treatment of FXS or its most common symptoms, although various classes of medications are used off-label for the treatment of behavioral and mental health conditions associated with FXS. Some patients with FXS benefit from medications that treat attention deficit disorders, while others experiencing general anxiety, social anxiety and other chronic conditions may benefit from different types of anti-anxiety medications. Multiple companies are developing compounds for the treatment of FXS, including Confluence Pharmaceuticals, Allos Pharma, Tetra Therapeutics (a subsidiary of Shionogi & Co., Ltd.), Actinogen Medical, Autifony Therapeutics and Healx.
​
ASD
​
Two atypical antipsychotic drugs, risperidone and aripiprazole, are approved for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder. Various classes of medications are used off-label for the treatment of behavioral conditions associated with ASD. Early intervention can improve learning, communication and social skills, as well as underlying brain development. Applied behavior analysis, or ABA, and therapies based on its principles are the most researched and commonly used behavioral interventions for autism. Many children affected by autism also benefit from other interventions such as speech and occupational therapy. Multiple other companies are developing therapeutics agents to address autistic disorders, including, Lundbeck and Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, who is studying Epidiolex, a sesame oil liquid formulation of highly concentrated plant extracted cannabidiol, in ASD and which is currently approved for the treatment of seizures associated with DS, LGS and TCS in the United States and several other territories around the world. 
​
22q
​
There are no drugs approved for the treatment of 22q or its most common symptoms, although various classes of medications are used off-label for the treatment of the behavioral symptoms. There are two primary stages of 22q patient management. During infancy, doctors address the acute physical concerns, such as anomalies of heart and palate, with surgery. Once the physical concerns are stabilized, the focus shifts to managing the neuropsychiatric symptoms, with anxiety being a key symptom. Anxiety is predominately managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also an important component of treatment. We are not aware of any studies of cannabidiol, THC or any other cannabinoid in this patient population. 
​
Government Regulation and Product Approval
​
As a development stage pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. In addition, labelers of drug products (the entity owing the National Drug Code listed for a product) participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, rebate, and other requirements. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union, or EU, are addressed in a centralized way through the EMA and the EC, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.
​
U.S. Government Regulation
​
The FDA is the primary body that regulates pharmaceuticals in the United States, and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. In 

21



particular, while the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or the DEA, has advised that it will not regulate Zygel as a controlled substance due to no detectable amounts of THC in its formulation, in some jurisdictions, cannabidiol may be classified as a controlled substance and is therefore subject to additional regulations by the appropriate regulatory authority. A failure to comply with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, which could include the imposition of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
​
The steps required to obtain approval for commercialization of a new drug in the United States are lengthy, complex and expensive, and the outcome is far from certain. These steps generally include:
​

● | completion of preclinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each target indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | submission of an NDA to the FDA;
--+---------------------------------

​

● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

​
Pre-clinical Testing
​
Before testing any compound in humans in the United States, a company must develop pre-clinical data, generally including laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animal species to assess safety and quality. Certain types of animal studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations and the Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture.
​
Clinical Trials
​
FDA regulations require that the person or entity sponsoring or conducting a clinical study in the United States for the purpose of investigating a drug candidate’s safety and effectiveness submit to the FDA an IND application, which contains pre-clinical testing results and provides a basis for the FDA to conclude that there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. If the FDA does not place the proposed clinical trial in the IND application on clinical hold within this 30-day period, the clinical trial may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing 

22



on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB. The sponsor, investigators and IRB must, as applicable, obtain the informed written consent of each participating subject, comply with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitor the clinical trial, and timely report adverse events. We filed an IND with the FDA for Zygel in FXS in 2018 and we also plan to file an IND with the FDA for Zygel in ASD in 2022 prior to the initiation of our Phase 3 program in ASD in the second-half of 2022.
​
We plan to submit NDAs for our product candidates to the FDA upon completion of all requisite clinical trials. The clinical investigation of an investigational product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
​

● | Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of a product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, PK and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s safety, PK and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted to develop initial data regarding the effectiveness of the product candidate in the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and additional safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically controlled and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk profile of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most (though not all) cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to support approval of a drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may issue a “clinical hold,” ordering the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients, or for other reasons. If the FDA issues a clinical hold halting a clinical trial, the agency must notify the IND sponsor of the grounds for the hold. Any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the FDA will lift the hold and allow the clinical trial to begin or resume. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor called a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or data monitoring committee, or DMC. A DSMB or DMC may provide recommendations on whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points, based on access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trials as well as clinical trial results after completion.
​
A sponsor may request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design and size of certain clinical trials (including Phase 3 clinical trials), clinical studies, or animal studies to address applicable scientific and regulatory requirements. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and if areas of agreement are reached, they will be documented in a letter. The agreement generally may not be 

23



changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. 
​
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
​
There are also various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals.
 ​
We have previously conducted clinical trials for Zygel in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and plan to continue conducting clinical trials in these jurisdictions, along with the United Kingdom and Ireland, and are subject to FDA regulatory requirements as well as the regulatory requirements related to the conduct of clinical trials of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, in Australia, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Device Safety Authority, or Medsafe, in New Zealand, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom and the Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland. We may also decide to conduct clinical trials in additional foreign countries and, would be subject to laws and regulations governing the conduct of such trials in those countries and any other foreign countries where we decide to study Zygel in the future.
​
New Drug Applications (NDA)
​
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, pharmacology, manufacturing, controls and proposed packaging and labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States may be accepted by the FDA subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. If the drug has a potential for abuse, the NDA must include a description and analysis of studies or information related to abuse of the drug, including a proposal for scheduling under the federal Controlled Substances Act, or CSA, where applicable. A description of any studies or data related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis, antidotes, or other treatments, if known.
​
In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, currently $3,117,218 for fiscal year 2022. The applicant under an approved new drug application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently $369,413 per product for fiscal year 2022. These fees are typically increased annually. There may be some instances in which the user fee is waived, including in the case of an orphan drug designation, such as with Zygel for FXS and 22q. The FDA will 

24



initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has up to 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the application is not sufficiently complete, the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for filing and request additional information. A refusal to file, which requires resubmission of the NDA with the requested additional information, delays review of the application. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most NDAs for standard review product candidates are reviewed within 12 months of submission. The FDA can extend this review to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. Most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates that present challenging questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
​
Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or, if the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA’s interpretation of data may differ from that of the sponsor. Obtaining approval can take years, requires substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the targeted disease or condition, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.
​
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
​
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including certain changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally applies the same procedures and standards in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
​
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

25



​
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
​
Some countries require sponsors of clinical trials of certain regulated products, including prescription drugs, to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website. For example, in the United States, sponsors are required to register this information on a website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, at www.clinicaltrials.gov. In Australia and New Zealand, sponsors register clinical trial information on a website maintained by the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry at www.anzctr.org.au. When a clinical trial is registered on these websites, certain information regarding the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial must be posted. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of many of these trials after completion, although under certain circumstances disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
​
Advertising and Promotion
​
The FDA and other federal agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, promotion to healthcare practitioners, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA historically has restricted manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as state authorities. This enforcement activity could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts as other potential penalties. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
​
Other Post-Approval Regulations
​
After a drug receives regulatory approval, its sponsor is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a company is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. cGMP includes requirements regarding organization and training of personnel, building and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers, closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before it can be implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a sponsor and any third-party 

26



manufacturers that a sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements or the conditions of the product’s approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement action, which could result in fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and/or criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP or other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
​
Compliance
​
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, refusal to accept clinical data from outside the United States, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. Third country authorities can impose equivalent penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
​
Controlled Substances
​
In 2021, we received guidance from the DEA that any pharmaceutically manufactured cannabidiols which do not contain any quantity of THC (or any other controlled substance) would not be classified as a controlled substance. As part of the specifications for Zygel, we require receipt of a Certificate of Analysis from our manufacturers confirming that THC is not detected in the API used in our manufacturing process. This results in Zygel no longer being subject to regulation under the CSA. 
​
While the DEA has advised that Zygel will not be subject to regulation under the CSA, states and foreign regulators could still regulate it as a controlled substance. Individual states in the U.S. may also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution and dispensing requirements, apart from the requirements under the CSA. State Authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, may choose to regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements (if any), particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 
​
We currently use contract manufacturers in the United States and Canada to manufacture the API for Zygel and contract manufacturers in the United Kingdom and Australia to manufacture the drug product. We have previously conducted clinical trials for Zygel in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and plan to continue conducting clinical trials in these jurisdictions, along with the United Kingdom and Ireland. We may decide to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates in additional countries. As a result, depending on the classification of pharmaceutically manufactured cannabidiols like Zygel in those jurisdictions, we may be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations from the TGA in Australia, Health Canada’s Office of Controlled Substances in Canada, Medsafe in New Zealand, the Drugs & Firearms Unit (Home Office) of the National Drug Control System in the United Kingdom, and from other regulatory agencies in other countries where we develop, manufacture or commercialize Zygel in the future.

The Hatch-Waxman Act
​
Generic Competition
​
Any drug candidates approved for commercial marketing under an NDA would be subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Among other things, the Hatch-Waxman Act establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products. The first provides that generic versions of an approved product may be 

27



approved under an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, by a showing that the generic product is the “same as” the approved product in key respects. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), same strength, route of administration and dosage form as a previously approved NDA product (the “reference listed drug” or RLD) and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “therapeutic equivalents” to the RLD and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD. 505(b)(2) applications are the second approval pathway for follow-on drug products. 505(b)(2) applications are NDAs and must therefore contain full reports of safety and effectiveness data; however, in a 505(b)(2) application at least some of the required data is derived from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. In this regard, a 505(b)(2) application may rely on scientific literature or on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness of an approved RLD. Unlike an ANDA, a 505(b)(2) may be submitted for a product that differs in active ingredient, strength, route of administration, dosage form, or other conditions of use.
​
The approval of drug products submitted under these abbreviated approval pathways may be prevented by certain periods of regulatory exclusivity and/or extended patent protection provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act.
​
Impact of Listed Patents
​
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed with the approved RLD in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify: (i) that the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) that the listed patent has expired; (iii) the date that the listed patent will expire; or (iv) that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
​
A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patent owner once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder and/or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. If the patent was listed in the Orange Book before submission of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. This regulatory stay is commonly referred to as a “30-month stay.”
​
Marketing Exclusivity
​
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application cannot be approved until the expiration of any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD.
​
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides certain periods of regulatory exclusivity. These include: (1) five years of regulatory exclusivity for a drug product that contains a new chemical entity, or NCE, which generally means an active ingredient that contains a novel active moiety; and (2) three years of exclusivity for the approval of an NDA or supplemental NDA that contains data from new clinical investigations that were necessary for approval. Three-year exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving a follow-on product with the same conditions of approval for three years. By contrast, NCE exclusivity prevents the FDA from accepting for review an application for a follow-on product that contains the protected active moiety during the five-year period dating from the product’s approval. However, if the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application contains a Paragraph IV certification, that application may be submitted four years after approval of the listed drug protected by NCE exclusivity. In that case, if timely patent litigation is filed, the regulatory stay will 

28



expire seven and a half years after the approval of the RLD, unless it terminates early based on expiration of the patent, a settlement of the patent litigation, or a decision in the litigation favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
​
If there is no patent listed in the Orange Book with the RLD, there can be no Paragraph IV certification; in these circumstances, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) may be filed before the expiration of the NCE exclusivity period.
​
Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available under Section 505A of the FDC Act if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor timely submits and the agency accepts reports of requested studies relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six-month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. Pediatric exclusivity does not extend the term of the patent; instead, it extends by six months the preclusive effect of the patent on FDA’s authority to approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. Whether pediatric exclusivity will extend a listed patent depends on the type of patent certification provided by the follow-on applicant and the outcome of any associated litigation arising from that certification.
​
Patent Term Extension
​
The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug that contains an active ingredient not previously approved may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.
​
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
​
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
​
In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these antibribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
​
European and Other International Government Regulation
​
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter that that required for FDA approval. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the national health authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
​

29



To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a MAA. In the European Union, marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized procedure, decentralized procedure, mutual recognition procedure, or the national procedure of an individual EU Member State. In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA to be assessed by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The agency will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a product in all 27 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This route is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health. 
​
Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
​
The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
​
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia or New Zealand, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
​
Data Exclusivity
​
In the European Union, if a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. 
​
Orphan Drug Designation
​
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to an investigational new drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, orphan drug designation may nevertheless be available if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. In the United States, a drug that has received orphan 

30



drug designation is eligible for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. The Orphan Drug Act provides that, if a designated drug is approved for the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the approved product will be granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA generally may not approve any other application for a product containing the same active moiety for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 
​
In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, orphan drug designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
​
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Product candidates that qualify for orphan designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development and approval process and, as a practical matter, clinical trials for orphan product candidates may be smaller, simply because of the smaller patient population. Nonetheless, the same approval standards apply to orphan-designated product candidates as for other drug candidates. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
​
In August 2017, President Trump signed into law the Food & Drug Administration Reauthorization Act. This legislation imposes significant new requirements for clinical trial sponsors which will affect, among other things, obtaining orphan drug designation, and the development of drugs and biological products for pediatric use.
​
Priority Review, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Accelerated Approval (United States) 
​
The FDA has programs to expedite submission and consideration of certain drug product candidates that address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. An application for a drug will receive priority review designation if it is for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review means that the FDA will seek to complete its first-cycle review and take action on the application within six months rather than the customary 10-month standard review period. An applicant may request priority review at the time it submits its application. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
​

31



Additionally, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing investigational new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives fast track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Product candidates with fast track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product candidates’ development. In May 2019, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with FXS. Other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review include accelerated approval (i.e., approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit) and breakthrough therapy designation, which is available for drugs under development for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. If a drug receives breakthrough therapy designation, it will be eligible for all of the benefits of fast track designation, as well as for more intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from the agency to involve senior FDA managers in such guidance. Even if a product candidate qualifies for fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for these designations, and/or may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval.
​
Accelerated Review (European Union)
​
Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
​
Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, which could increase the amount of 

32



Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct.  As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the ACA or any of its provisions.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 retained the federal budget “sequestration” Medicare payment reductions of 2%, and extended it through 2027 unless congressional action is taken, and also increased labeler responsibility for prescription costs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the Biden Administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry. 
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans by increasing from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. As noted above, the 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. 

33



Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. 
Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing. These measures have included price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures. In some cases, the measures appeared designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing arrangements.
 ​
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Coverage and Reimbursement
​
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
​
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2003, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products, including creating the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. In addition, we will be subject to the rules and regulations issued by CMS from time to time for Medicare Part D, such as the requirement to include drug price increases and lower cost therapeutic alternatives on the Part D Explanation of Benefits that Medicare Part D sends members to inform Medicare beneficiaries about possible ways to lower their out of pocket costs by considering a lower cost medication.
​
Existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by Medicaid. Rebate amounts for a product are determined by a statutory formula that is based on prices defined in the statute: AMP, which must be calculated for all products that are covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program, 

34



and best price, which must be calculated only for those covered outpatient drugs that are a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug, such as biologic products. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law, as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid rebate program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a “Master Agreement” obligating it to provide a formulaic discount of approximately 24% known as the federal ceiling price, for drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible healthcare organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above.
​
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, each EU Member State can restrict the range of medicinal products for which its national health insurance system provides reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use marketed on its territory. As a result, following receipt of marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with the competent pricing authority in the individual EU Member State. The governments of the EU Member States influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some EU Member States operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Further, some EU Member States approve a specific price for the medicinal product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, we may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
​
Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products, however, is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
​
The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU Member States.
​
In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States.

​
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. With few exceptions (e.g., limitations on Medicare Part D sponsors concerning certain formulary changes), coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
​
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
​
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
​
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation, particularly once third-party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products, by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (for example, the OIG), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Although an arrangement’s failure to satisfy an exception or safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal, practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
​
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and reached substantial financial settlements under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. 
​
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

​
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.
​
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct.
​
In addition, we are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we potentially could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity (e.g., a healthcare provider or a health plan) in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. 
​
As we conduct clinical trials in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Ireland and may in the future conduct clinical trials or seek to commercialize our products outside of the United States, we will also be subject to a variety of foreign data protection laws and regulations. For example, for our clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Ireland, there are strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, for jurisdictions in the European Union, and by the Data Protection Act of 2018 for trials conducted in the United Kingdom. For our clinical trials in Australia, to the extent that the sites for our trials include certain university, company or government agencies, we may be subject to restrictions and data protection obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). We may, otherwise, be subject to additional data protection laws in Australia in the states and territories in which we conduct our trials, which have similar restrictions on our ability to collect, analyze and transfer medical records and other patient data. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
​
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are 

37



found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
​
In addition, at the federal level, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, regulates the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs. The DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in prescription drug distribution, for example, it requires manufacturers to affix a product identifier to each package and case of a prescription drug product intended for sale. A product identifier is an electronically-readable graphic that contains information including the product’s unique numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date. The DSCA also requires relevant parties and to identify and remove illegitimate products from the market, including products that are counterfeit, stolen, intentionally contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, its implementing regulations and state laws also regulate the distribution of prescription drug product samples.

In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state law requirements for registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states, and more recently some large cities, have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, register their sales representatives, and/or limit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
​
Clinical Advisors 
​
We have established a clinical advisory board and we regularly seek advice and input from these experienced clinical leaders on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our clinical advisory board consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. We intend to continue to leverage the broad expertise of our advisors by seeking their counsel on important topics relating to our product development and clinical development programs. Our clinical advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our clinical advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. All of our clinical advisors are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us.
