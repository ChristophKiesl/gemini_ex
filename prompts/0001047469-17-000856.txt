      ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Business Overview 
               Insmed is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the unmet needs of patients with rare diseases. Our lead product candidate is ARIKAYCE, or liposomal amikacin for inhalation (LAI), which is in late-stage development for adult patients with treatment refractory nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), a rare and often chronic infection that is capable of causing irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. Our earlier clinical-stage pipeline includes INS1007 and INS1009. INS1007 is a novel oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1), an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases, which are implicated in the pathology of chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis. INS1009 is an inhaled nanoparticle formulation of a treprostinil prodrug that may offer a differentiated product profile for rare pulmonary disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 
               The table below summarizes the current status and anticipated milestones for our principal product candidates: ARIKAYCE, INS1007, and INS1009. 

   
Product Candidate/Target Indications | Status | Next Expected Milestones 
ARIKAYCE (LAI) for adult patients with treatment refractory NTM lung infections caused by MAC |  We are advancing the CONVERT (or 212) study, a randomized, open-label global phase 3 clinical study of ARIKAYCE in adult patients with treatment refractory NTM lung disease caused by MAC. We have achieved our enrollment objective for the CONVERT study.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated ARIKAYCE as an orphan drug, a breakthrough therapy, and a qualified infectious disease product (QIDP).  The European Commission has granted an orphan designation for ARIKAYCE for the treatment of NTM lung disease. |  We expect to report top-line results for the Month 6 primary endpoint in the second half of 2017.  If the CONVERT study meets its primary endpoint, we intend to seek accelerated marketing approval for ARIKAYCE in the US. We intend to seek marketing approvals for ARIKAYCE in certain countries outside the US, when sufficient data are available. If approved, we expect ARIKAYCE would be the first inhaled antibiotic specifically indicated for the treatment of refractory NTM lung infections caused by MAC in North America, Europe, and Japan.  If approved, we plan to commercialize ARIKAYCE in the US, certain countries in Europe, Japan and certain other countries.

Product Candidate/Target Indications | Status | Next Expected Milestones 
INS1007 (oral reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1) for non-CF bronchiectasis |  In October 2016, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca for the exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing AZD7986 (AZ License Agreement). We renamed the compound INS1007 and plan to pursue an initial indication of non-CF bronchiectasis.  We are defining our regulatory strategies to potentially secure US and EU orphan drug designations and expedite the development and regulatory review of INS1007 through programs such as US fast track designation and breakthrough therapy. |  We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA for non-CF bronchiectasis and subsequently commence a phase 2 clinical study of INS1007. The study is expected to begin in 2017.
INS1009 (inhaled nanoparticle formulation of a treprostinil prodrug) for rare pulmonary disorders |  The results of our phase 1 study of INS1009 were presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in September 2016.  The phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study of INS1009 for inhalation to determine its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. |  We believe INS1009 may offer a differentiated product profile for rare pulmonary disorders, including PAH, and we are currently evaluating our options to advance its development. 


              Our earlier-stage pipeline includes preclinical compounds that we are evaluating in multiple rare diseases of unmet medical need, including methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) and NTM. To complement our internal research and development, we actively evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for a broad range of rare diseases. 
   Corporate History 
               We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia on November 29, 1999. On December 1, 2010, we completed a business combination with Transave, Inc. (Transave), a privately held New Jersey-based company focused on the development of differentiated and innovative inhaled pharmaceuticals for the site-specific treatment of serious lung diseases. 
 Our Strategy 
               Our strategy focuses on the needs of patients with rare diseases. We are currently focused on the development and commercialization of ARIKAYCE. We are not aware of any inhaled products 
 6

   specifically indicated to treat refractory NTM lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. While we believe that ARIKAYCE has the potential to treat a number of different bacterial infections, we are prioritizing securing US regulatory approval of ARIKAYCE for adult patients with refractory NTM lung disease caused by MAC. We are also advancing earlier-stage programs in other rare pulmonary disorders. 
               Our current priorities are as follows:
 

· Advancing the CONVERT study; · Preparing a New Drug Application (NDA) for submission to the FDA for
ARIKAYCE, which we
plan to base on the primary endpoint of the CONVERT study; · Ensuring our product supply chain will support the clinical development and, if
approved, commercialization of ARIKAYCE; · Preparing for potential commercialization of ARIKAYCE in the US, certain countries in
Europe, Japan, and certain other countries; · Developing the core value dossier to support the global reimbursement of ARIKAYCE; · Supporting further research and lifecycle management strategies for ARIKAYCE;
· Filing an IND with the FDA and starting a phase 2 study of INS1007 in non-CF
bronchiectasis; · Generating preclinical findings from our earlier-stage program(s);
and· Expanding our rare disease pipeline through corporate development. 

 Product Pipeline 
   ARIKAYCE for patients with NTM lung disease 
               Our lead product candidate is ARIKAYCE, or LAI, a novel, once-daily liposomal formulation of amikacin that is in late-stage clinical development for adult patients with treatment refractory NTM lung disease caused by MAC, a rare and often chronic infection that is capable of causing irreversible lung damage and which can be fatal. Amikacin solution for parenteral administration is an established drug that has activity against a variety of NTM; however, its use is limited by the need to administer it intravenously and by toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function (Peloquin et al., 2004). Unlike intravenous amikacin, our advanced liposome technology uses charge-neutral liposomes to deliver amikacin directly to the lung where it is taken up by the lung macrophages where the NTM infection resides. This prolongs the release of amikacin in the lungs while minimizing systemic exposure thereby offering the potential for decreased systemic toxicities. ARIKAYCE's ability to deliver high levels of amikacin directly to the lung distinguishes it from intravenous amikacin. ARIKAYCE is administered once-daily, using a portable aerosol delivery system, via an optimized, investigational eFlow® Nebulizer System manufactured by PARI. 
               The FDA has designated ARIKAYCE as an orphan drug, a breakthrough therapy, and a QIDP for NTM lung disease. Orphan designation features seven years of post-approval market exclusivity, and QIDP features an additional five years of post-approval exclusivity. As a result, ARIKAYCE would have 12 years of post-approval marketing exclusivity in the US, if approved. A QIDP-designated product is eligible for fast track status and is often granted priority review status. A priority review designation for a drug means the FDA's goal is to take action on the NDA within six months following the 60-day filing date, as compared to 10 months of the 60-day filing date under a standard review. 
 



The CONVERT study 


               ARIKAYCE is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 randomized, open-label clinical study taking place in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Asia that is designed to confirm the culture conversion results seen in our phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect will provide the basis 
 7

   for submitting an NDA to the FDA. Because the highest response to ARIKAYCE treatment in our phase 2 study was observed in the subgroup of non-CF patients with NTM lung infection caused by MAC, the CONVERT study is comprised of non-CF patients 18 years and older with an NTM lung infection caused by MAC that is refractory to a stable multi-drug regimen for at least six months, with the regimen either ongoing or interrupted within 12 months of screening. The CONVERT study excludes subjects whose susceptibility scores indicate that their MAC lung infection is resistant to amikacin. We achieved our enrollment objective for the CONVERT study in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
               After a screening period of approximately 10 weeks, eligible subjects were randomized 2:1 to once-daily ARIKAYCE plus a multi-drug regimen or a multi-drug regimen without ARIKAYCE. The first analysis, after the last patient has completed Month 6, will be based on the primary efficacy endpoint comparing the proportion of subjects who achieve culture conversion (three consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) by Month 6 in the ARIKAYCE plus multi-drug regimen arm compared to the arm in which subjects receive a multi-drug regimen without ARIKAYCE. The study's key secondary endpoint in the first analysis includes the change from baseline in the six-minute walk test. A subsequent analysis will examine off-treatment assessments to evaluate the durability of the anti-mycobacterial effect on sputum culture at 3 months off all treatment. The study also includes a comprehensive pharmacokinetic sub-study in Japanese subjects in lieu of a separate local pharmacokinetic study in Japan. 
               At Month 8, after all sputum culture results are known up to and including Month 6, subjects will be assessed as converters (those achieving culture conversion by Month 6) or non-converters for the primary efficacy endpoint. All converters will continue on their randomized treatment regimen for an additional 12 months. All converters will return for off-treatment follow-up visits. A 12-month off-treatment study visit will be the last visit for the CONVERT study. All non-converters, as determined at the Month 8 visit, may be eligible to enter a separate 12-month, single-arm, open-label study (the 312 study). The primary objective of the 312 study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ARIKAYCE in combination with a standard multi-drug regimen. The secondary endpoints of the 312 study include evaluating the proportion of subjects achieving culture conversion (three consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) by Month 6 and the proportion of subjects achieving culture conversion by Month 12 (end of treatment). 
               The protocol for the CONVERT study incorporates feedback from the FDA and the EMA via its scientific advice working party process, as well as local health authorities in other countries, including Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. If the CONVERT study meets the primary endpoint of culture conversion by Month 6, we believe we would be eligible to submit an NDA pursuant to 21 C.F.R. Part 314 Subpart H (Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses), which permits the FDA to approve a drug based on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint, provided the sponsor commits to study the drug further to verify and describe the confirmatory data of the drug's clinical benefit. We believe that efficacy data from the CONVERT study after Month 6 in combination with the durability data, if successful, will suffice to meet both the accelerated and confirmatory data requirements. 
 



Phase 2 Study (112 Study) 


               Our completed phase 2 study, which is also known as the 112 study, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ARIKAYCE in adults with NTM lung disease due to MAC or M. abscessus that was refractory to guideline-based therapy. In October 2016, the results from the phase 2 study were published online in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (Olivier et al. 2016). 
 8

                 The study included an 84-day double-blind phase in which subjects were randomized 1:1 either to ARIKAYCE once-daily plus a multi-drug regimen or to placebo once-daily plus a multi-drug regimen. After completing the 84-day double-blind phase, subjects had the option of continuing in an 84-day open-label phase during which all subjects received ARIKAYCE plus the same multi-drug regimen. The study also included 28-day and 12-month off-ARIKAYCE follow-up assessments. Eighty-nine (89) subjects were randomized and dosed in the study. Of the 80 subjects who completed the 84-day double-blind phase, 78 subjects entered the open-label phase and received ARIKAYCE plus the same multi-drug regimen for an additional 84 days. Seventy-six (76) percent (59/78) of subjects who entered the open-label phase of the study completed the open-label study. 
               The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change from baseline (Day 1) to the end of the double-blind phase of the trial (Day 84) in a semi-quantitative measurement of mycobacterial density on a seven-point scale. ARIKAYCE did not meet the pre-specified level for statistical significance although there was a positive trend (p=0.072) in favor of ARIKAYCE. The p-value for the key secondary endpoint of culture conversion to negative at Day 84 was 0.003, in favor of ARIKAYCE. A shorter time to first negative sputum culture was also observed with ARIKAYCE relative to placebo during the double-blind phase (p=0.013). 
               The microbiologic outcomes from the 112 study were also explored post hoc using a more stringent definition of culture conversion, which was defined as at least three consecutive monthly sputum samples that test negative for NTM, consistent with the definition of culture conversion in the guidelines and in clinical practice. Twenty-three (23) subjects achieved at least three consecutive negative monthly sputum samples by the 28-day follow-up assessment, of which four started to convert at baseline prior to administration of study drug. For the other 19 patients who achieved culture conversion, 17 achieved culture conversion after receiving ARIKAYCE (10 during the double-blind phase and seven after entering the open-label phase, of which six received ARIKAYCE for the first time in the open-label phase). Two patients achieved culture conversion while receiving placebo during the double-blind phase. The majority of subjects who achieved culture conversion (three consecutive negative monthly sputum samples) during the double-blind phase continued to have negative cultures through the open-label and follow-up phases. 
               At the end of the double-blind phase, the ARIKAYCE group improved from baseline in mean distance walked in the six-minute walk test. At the end of the open-label phase, patients in the ARIKAYCE group continued to improve in the mean distance walked in the six-minute walk test, while the patients who previously received placebo in the double-blind phase and subsequently received ARIKAYCE in the open-label phase demonstrated a reduced rate of decline from baseline. 
               Ninety (90) percent of patients in both treatment groups experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event with most events either mild or moderate in severity. During the double-blind phase a greater percentage of patients treated with ARIKAYCE experienced dysphonia, bronchiectasis exacerbation, cough, oropharyngeal pain, fatigue, chest discomfort, wheezing, and infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis. No clinically relevant changes were detected in laboratory values and vital signs. 
 



Further research and lifecycle management for ARIKAYCE 


               We are exploring and supporting research and lifecycle management programs for ARIKAYCE beyond NTM lung infections caused by MAC. Lifecycle management initiatives are company-driven planning programs to help us reach more potential patients for ARIKAYCE, once sufficient data are generated and applicable regulatory bodies approve ARIKAYCE for these indications. These programs may include new clinical studies sponsored by us to develop data for such additional indications. We 
 9

   may also support investigator-initiated studies, which are clinical studies initiated and sponsored by physicians or research institutions with funding from us. 
 



Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ARIKAYCE 


               In the fourth quarter of 2014, we filed an MAA with the EMA for ARIKAYCE as a treatment for NTM lung disease in adult patients and for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with  Pseudomonas lung infections. The filing was based on data from our phase 3 study in CF patients with  Pseudomonas and our phase 2 study in patients with NTM. In February 2015, the EMA validated our MAA as complete for review. The EMA subsequently requested additional information with respect to the CF indication regarding the similarity of ARIKAYCE to another product that has an orphan designation for the same  Pseudomonas indication. In the third quarter of 2015, the EMA adopted our request to withdraw the  Pseudomonas indication from our MAA. In April 2016, we submitted our written responses to the EMA's 180-day list of outstanding issues (LOI). In May 2016, we participated in an oral explanation meeting with the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the NTM indication to address the LOI. After the oral explanation meeting, the CHMP concluded that the data submitted did not provide enough evidence to support an approval. In June 2016, we withdrew our MAA. We intend to resubmit our MAA when sufficient clinical data are available. 
 



NTM Lung Disease Market Opportunity 


               NTM is a rare and serious disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality. NTM currently includes over 185 species. MAC is the predominant pathogenic species in NTM pulmonary disease in the US, Japan and Europe, followed by M. abscessus, both of which we have studied in our development of ARIKAYCE. Our CONVERT trial is studying refractory NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adult patients. The prevalence of human disease attributable to NTM has increased over the past two decades, and it is an emerging public health concern worldwide. 
               A 2015 publication from co-authors from several US government departments projected approximately 180,000 cases of NTM lung disease in the US in 2014 (Strollo et al., 2015) (the Strollo publication) and is increasing at a rate of approximately 8% per year (1997-2007 research study). Previously, based on market research in 2012 and 2013 conducted by Clarity Pharma Research, we estimated that of patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of NTM lung disease, an estimated 10 to 30 percent were refractory to current treatments. In 2013, we engaged Clarity Pharma Research to perform a chart audit study of NTM lung disease in Europe and Japan, which estimated that there are approximately 20,000 cases of pulmonary disease attributable to NTM within the EU5, approximately 30,000 total cases in the 28 countries then-comprising the European Union (EU) and nearly 32,000 cases in Japan. Although population-based data on the epidemiology of NTM lung disease are limited, and determining the true prevalence and incidence of rare diseases can be challenging, studies worldwide have described an increasing prevalence of NTM lung disease. 
               Patients with NTM lung disease may experience a multitude of symptoms such as chronic cough, fever, weight loss, lack of appetite, night sweats, blood in the sputum, and fatigue, and frequently require lengthy, and repeat, hospital stays to manage their condition. In a burden of illness study that we conducted in the US with a major medical benefits provider, we concluded that patients with NTM lung infections are costly to healthcare plans and ATS/IDSA guideline-based treatment results in healthcare savings as opposed to suboptimal treatment. Other claims-based studies have shown the following:
 

· A 36.1% increase in the incidence of NTM lung infections between 2008 and 2013 in the
US Medicare population of a national managed care health plan, with the greatest incidence increase (56.3%) observed in members 65 to 74 years of age. Following diagnosis with NTM 

 10

   

lung
infections, over 50% of members were still in the plan after six years (Abraham et al., 2015). 


· Patients with NTM lung infections were using greater healthcare resources than their age
and gender-matched controls in the period preceding their initial diagnosis. Ordering mycobacterial testing of sputum earlier may help in preventing a misdiagnosis or delaying a diagnosis (Holt
et al., 2015). · Higher resource utilization and costs for patients with NTM lung infections than their
age and gender-matched controls both pre- and post-diagnosis. Patients who received treatment regimens conforming to the 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines showed lower healthcare resource utilization and total
medical costs than patients who received suboptimal treatment (Abraham et al., 2015). 

               Current ATS/IDSA guideline-based approaches involve multi-drug regimens that may cause severe side effects and treatment can last two years or more. We are not aware of any inhaled antibiotic treatments specifically indicated for the treatment of refractory NTM lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. 
   INS1007 
               INS1007 is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we in-licensed from AstraZeneca in October 2016. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. Neutrophils, which play a key role in the pathologic inflammatory process, contain three neutrophil serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G, that have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active neutrophil serine proteases that cause lung destruction and inflammation. INS1007 may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases, such as non-CF bronchiectasis, by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of neutrophil serine proteases. 
 



Non-CF bronchiectasis 


               Non-CF bronchiectasis is a rare, progressive pulmonary disorder in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to chronic inflammation and infection. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. There is currently no cure for non-CF bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis increases susceptibility to NTM lung disease, and up to 50 percent of patients with bronchiectasis may also have an active NTM lung infection. 
 



Phase 1 study results 


               In a phase 1 study of healthy volunteers, INS1007 (previously AZD7986) was well tolerated and demonstrated inhibition of the activity of the neutrophil serine protease neutrophil elastase in a dose and concentration dependent manner. In preclinical studies, it was shown to reversibly inhibit DPP1 and the activation of neutrophil serine proteases within maturing neutrophils. 
               We plan to submit an IND application with the FDA for INS1007 in non-CF bronchiectasis, and after it becomes effective, to commence a phase 2 clinical study of INS1007 in that indication. We expect the study to begin in 2017. In addition, we are evaluating INS1007 in other potential indications. 
 11

     INS1009 
               INS1009 is an investigational sustained-release inhaled treprostinil prodrug nanoparticle formulation that has the potential to address certain of the current limitations of existing prostanoid therapies. We believe that INS1009 prolongs duration of effect and may provide PAH patients with greater consistency in pulmonary arterial pressure reduction over time. Current inhaled prostanoid therapies must be dosed four to nine times per day for the treatment of PAH. Reducing dose frequency has the potential to ease patient burden and improve compliance. Additionally, we believe that INS1009 may be associated with fewer side effects, including elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, and severity and/or frequency of cough, associated with high initial drug levels and local upper airway exposure when using current inhaled prostanoid therapies. We believe INS1009 may offer a differentiated product profile for rare pulmonary disorders, including PAH, and we are currently evaluating our options to advance its development. 
 



Phase 1 study results 


               In late 2014, we had a pre-investigational new drug (pre-IND) meeting with the FDA for INS1009 and clarified that, subject to final review of the preclinical data, INS1009 could be eligible for an approval pathway under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) (505(b)(2) approval). Like a traditional NDA that is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, a 505(b)(2) NDA must establish that the drug is safe and effective, but unlike a traditional NDA, the applicant may rely at least in part on studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant does not have a right of reference. The ability to rely on existing third-party data to support safety and/or effectiveness can reduce the time and cost associated with traditional NDAs. 
               We have completed a phase 1 study of INS1009. The phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose study of INS1009 for inhalation to determine its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four (24) subjects were enrolled and received INS1009 with cohorts of eight subjects receiving doses of 85 micrograms (mcg), 170 mcg, 340 mcg or placebo. Participants in the first cohort (8 patients) received a single dose of open label treprostinil (Tyvaso) at 54 mcg 24 hours prior to receiving INS1009 at 85 mcg. The 85 mcg dose of INS1009 provides an equivalent amount of treprostinil on a molar basis as the 54 mcg dose of Tyvaso. The peak serum concentration was approximately 90% lower for treprostinil after INS1009 administration compared with Tyvaso, which could indicate a reduced future adverse event (AE) profile. The pharmacokinetic characteristics also supported once- or twice-daily dosing. The longer half-life of treprostinil for INS1009 was likely due to a sustained pulmonary release. The AE profile was consistent with other inhaled prostanoids. These data were presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in September 2016. 
   Research and Development 
               Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel serving in our research and development functions. Expenses also include other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates for clinical study (primarily related to activities at contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) that manufacture ARIKAYCE for our use), the cost of conducting clinical studies (primarily related to activities at contract research organizations (CROs) that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf), and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities. In addition, research and development expenses include payments to third parties for the license rights to products in development (prior to marketing approval). We incurred approximately $122.7 million, $74.3 million, and $56.3 million for research and development expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 12

     Corporate Development 
               In October 2016, we exclusively licensed global rights to INS1007 from AstraZeneca and we plan to continue to develop, acquire, in license or co-promote complementary products that address rare diseases. We are focused broadly on rare disease therapeutics and prioritizing those areas that best align with our core competencies and current therapeutic focus in the area of rare pulmonary diseases. 
 Manufacturing 
               We do not have any in-house manufacturing capability other than for small-scale pre-clinical development programs, and depend on a small number of third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of our product candidates for use in clinical trials. We plan to rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the commercial manufacture and supply of any product candidates that we may commercialize. ARIKAYCE is manufactured by Therapure Biopharma Inc. (Therapure) in Canada at a 200 liter scale and by Ajinimoto Althea, Inc. (Althea) in the US at a 50 liter scale. For additional information about our agreements with Therapure and Althea, see  License and Other AgreementsARIKAYCE-Related Agreements. We have also identified certain second source suppliers for our supply chain and plan to enter into supply and quality agreements with certain of these second source suppliers in preparation for commercialization of ARIKAYCE. In addition, we have entered into a commercialization agreement with PARI, the manufacturer of our drug delivery nebulizer for ARIKAYCE, to address our commercial supply needs (Commercialization Agreement). 
               We expect to enter into a commercial supply agreement with AstraZeneca related to certain short-term production needs for INS1007. We expect our future requirements for INS1007, beyond phase 2, will be manufactured by a CMO. 
               We currently produce INS1009 and plan to utilize third parties to manufacture INS1009 at a larger scale and to manufacture the nebulizer used to deliver the drug. 
   Intellectual Property 
               We own or license rights to more than 350 issued patents and pending patent applications in the US and in foreign countries, including more than 175 issued patents and pending patent applications related to ARIKAYCE. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain proprietary protection surrounding our product candidates, technology and know-how; to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We actively seek patent protection by filing patent applications, including on inventions that are important to the development of our business in the US, Europe, Japan, Canada, and selected other foreign markets that we consider key for our product candidates. These international markets generally include Australia, China, India, Israel, and Mexico. 
               Our patent strategy includes obtaining patent protection, where possible, on compositions of matter, methods of manufacture, methods of use, methods of treatment, dosing and administration regimens and formulations. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, in-licensing and partnership opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
               We monitor for activities that may infringe our proprietary rights, as well as the progression of third-party patent applications that may have the potential to create blocks to our products or otherwise interfere with the development of our business. We are aware, for example, of US patents, and corresponding international counterparts, owned by third parties that contain claims related to treating lung infections using inhaled antibiotics. If any of these patents were to be asserted against us, 
 13

   we do not believe that our proposed products would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents. 
               Reflecting our commitment to safeguarding proprietary information, we require our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators and other third-party partners to sign confidentiality agreements to protect the exchange of proprietary materials and information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. 
 



ARIKAYCE Patents and Trade Secrets 


               Of the patents and applications related to ARIKAYCE, there are seven issued US patents that cover the ARIKAYCE composition and its use in treating NTM. Upon ARIKAYCE approval for the treatment of NTM, these patents may be eligible for listing in the FDA Orange Book. These patents and their expiration dates are as follows:
 

· US Patent No. 7,718,189 (expires June 6, 2025) · US Patent No. 8,226,975 (expires
August 15, 2028) · US Patent No. 8,632,804 (expires December 5, 2026)
· US Patent No. 8,802,137 (expires April 8, 2024) · US Patent No. 8,679,532
(expires December 5, 2026) · US Patent No. 8,642,075 (expires December 5,
2026)· US Patent No. 9,566,234 (expires January 18, 2034) 

               In addition, we own five pending US patent applications that cover the ARIKAYCE composition and its use in treating NTM. Upon ARIKAYCE approval for the treatment of refractory NTM lung disease caused by MAC, these patent applications, if issued as patents, may be eligible for listing in the FDA Orange Book. We also own a pending US application that covers methods for making ARIKAYCE. 
               Four patents have been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) (European Patent Nos. 1581236, 1909759, 1962805 and 2363114) that cover ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM. In addition, we have five applications pending before the EPO that cover ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM lung disease. We also have a pending European application that covers methods of making ARIKAYCE. More than 40 patents have also been issued in other major foreign markets, e.g., Japan, China, Korea, Australia, and India, that cover ARIKAYCE and/or methods of using ARIKAYCE for treating various pulmonary disorders, including NTM lung disease. More than 60 foreign patent applications are pending that cover the ARIKAYCE composition and/or its use in treating various pulmonary disorders, including NTM lung disease. We anticipate that in the US, we will have potential patent coverage for ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM lung disease, through January 18, 2034, which does not include a potential six months of pediatric exclusivity. 
               Currently, our European Patent No. 2363114 is being opposed by Generics (UK) Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mylan NV. The European Patent Office Opposition Division (EPOOD) issued a preliminary non-binding opinion regarding the opposition on January 2, 2017, and an oral hearing regarding the opposition has been scheduled for November 15, 2017. The preliminary non-binding opinion did not address every issue in the opposition, but was favorable to us regarding the issues that were addressed. European Patent No. 1909759, owned by us, was previously opposed by Generics (UK) Ltd. An oral hearing was held on October 19, 2015 during which, we submitted amended claims. The EPOOD maintained the patent as amended. This decision is currently under appeal by Generics (UK) Ltd.

              Through our agreements with PARI, we have license rights to US and foreign patents and applications that cover the eFlow Nebulizer System medical device through January 18, 2034. We have rights to use the nebulizers in clinical trials, and we have entered into a commercial supply agreement with PARI. 
               The basic terms of utility patents issued in the US are the longer of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent was in force on or was issued from a patent application that was filed prior to June 8, 1995; or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed on or after June 8, 1995. All ARIKAYCE patent applications have earliest effective filing dates falling after June 8, 1995. The basic term of foreign utility patents may vary in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but is typically 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. 
 



INS1007 Patents 


               Through our agreement with AstraZeneca, we have licensed U.S. Patent No. 9,522,894, which has claims directed to INS1007 and expires January 21, 2035 (not taking into account any potential patent term extension). Counterpart patent applications are pending throughout the world and a continuation application is pending in the US. 
 



INS1009 Patents 


               We own US Patent No. 9,255,064 (expires October 24, 2034), which is the first patent to issue with claims covering hexadecyl-treprostinil, the treprostinil component of INS1009. Other treprostinil prodrugs are also claimed and described in the patent. We also own US Patent No. 9,469,600, which has claims directed to INS1009 and other treprostinil prodrug nanoparticle formulations and expires October 24, 2034. Counterpart patent applications to US Patent Nos. 9,255,064 and 9,469,600 are pending in Europe, Japan and other foreign jurisdictions. 
               We own pending patent applications that if granted, would cover methods for using treprostinil prodrugs and nanoparticle formulations comprising the same, including INS1009 in treating patients with PAH and other diseases, as well as methods for manufacturing such treprostinil prodrugs and nanoparticle formulations. 
   Trademarks 
               In addition to our patents and trade secrets, we have filed applications to register certain trademarks in the US and/or abroad, including INSMED and ARIKAYCE. At present, we have received either a registration or a notice of allowance for the INSMED and ARIKAYCE marks from the US Patent and Trademark Office. We have also received foreign notices of allowance or registrations for the INSMED and ARIKAYCE marks, among others. The EMA has indicated it has no objection to our use of the name ARIKAYCE, and the FDA has conditionally approved our use of the name ARIKAYCE as the proposed trade name for our LAI product candidate. Our ability to obtain and maintain trademark registrations will in certain geographical locations depend on making use of the mark in commerce on or in connection with our products and approval of the trademarks for our products by regulatory authorities in each country.

     License and Other Agreements 
 



ARIKAYCE-related Agreements 


               We currently rely, and will continue to rely, on agreements with a number of third parties in connection with the development and manufacture of ARIKAYCE. 
 



PARI Pharma GmbH 


               We have a licensing agreement with PARI for use of the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System for delivery of ARIKAYCE in treating patients with NTM lung infections, CF and bronchiectasis. Under the licensing agreement, we have rights under several US and foreign issued patents, and patent applications involving improvements to the optimized eFlow Nebulizer System, to exploit such system with ARIKAYCE for the treatment of such indications, but we cannot manufacture such nebulizers except as permitted under our Commercialization Agreement with PARI. We currently have rights to use the nebulizers in clinical trials. The eFlow Nebulizer System is labeled as investigational for use in our clinical trials in the US, Japan, Canada and Australia and must receive regulatory approval before we can market ARIKAYCE; the eFlow Nebulizer System has been approved for use in the EU. 
               We have certain obligations under this licensing agreement in relation to specified licensed indications. With respect to CF, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory and reimbursement approval, market and sell ARIKAYCE in two or more major European countries. With respect to NTM, CF and bronchiectasis, we have specific obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain developmental and regulatory milestones by set deadlines. Additionally, for NTM, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain commercial milestones in the US, Europe and Canada. The consequences of our failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve these milestones are context-specific, but include ending PARI's non-compete obligation, making the license non-exclusive and terminating the license, in each case with respect to the applicable indication. Termination of the licensing agreement or loss of exclusive rights may occur if we fail to meet our obligations, including payment of royalties to PARI, or if we do not meet certain milestones contained in the licensing agreement such as obtaining marketing approval or achieving the first commercial sale of ARIKAYCE. 
               Under the licensing agreement, we paid PARI an upfront license fee and PARI is entitled to receive milestone payments up to an aggregate of €4.3 million either in cash, qualified stock or a combination of both, at PARI's discretion, based on achievement of certain future milestone events including first acceptance of MAA submission (or equivalent) in the US of ARIKAYCE and the device, first receipt of marketing approval in the US for ARIKAYCE and the device, and first receipt of marketing approval in a major EU country for ARIKAYCE and the device. In addition, PARI is entitled to receive royalty payments in the mid-single digits on the net commercial sales of ARIKAYCE pursuant to the licensing agreement, subject to certain specified annual minimum royalties. 
               This license agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the final royalty payments have been made with respect to the last country in which ARIKAYCE is sold, or until the agreement is otherwise terminated by either party. We have the right to terminate this license agreement upon written notice for PARI's uncured material breach, if PARI is the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events, or if PARI fails to reach certain specified obligations. PARI has the right to terminate this license agreement upon written notice for our uncured material breach, if we are the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events, if we assign or otherwise transfer the agreement to a third party that does not agree to assume all of our rights and obligations set forth in the agreement, or if we fail to reach certain specified milestones. 
 16

                 In July 2014, we entered into the Commercialization Agreement with PARI for the manufacture and supply of eFlow nebulizer systems and related accessories (the Device) as optimized for use with our proprietary LAI. The Commercialization Agreement envisages that PARI will undertake the manufacturing of the Device except in the case of certain defined supply failures, when we will have the right to make the Device and have it made by third parties (but not certain third parties deemed under the Commercialization Agreement to compete with PARI). The Commercialization Agreement has an initial term of fifteen years from the first commercial sale of ARIKAYCE pursuant to the licensing agreement. The term of the Commercialization Agreement may be extended by us for an additional five years by providing written notice to PARI at least one year prior to the expiration of the initial term. 
 



Althea 


               In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Fill/Finish Services Agreement (the Fill/Finish Agreement) with Althea to produce, on a non-exclusive basis, ARIKAYCE in finished dosage form at a 50-liter scale. We are obligated to pay a minimum of $2.7 million for the batches of ARIKAYCE produced by Althea each calendar year during the term of the Fill/Finish Agreement. The Fill/Finish Agreement became effective as of January 1, 2015, and had an initial term that was to end on December 31, 2017. In 2016, we signed an extension of the Fill/Finish Agreement through December 31, 2019, and it may be extended for additional two-year periods upon mutual written agreement of us and Althea at least one year prior to the expiration of its then-current term. 
               Either we or Althea may terminate the Fill/Finish Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including (i) material breach of the Fill/Finish Agreement by either party, provided such breach is not cured within 30 days after receipt by the breaching party of written notice of the breach or (ii) insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the Fill/Finish Agreement without cause with 12 months' prior written notice to Althea, and Althea may terminate the Agreement without cause with 24 months' prior written notice to us. 
 



Therapure 


               In February 2014, we entered into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement with Therapure for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE at a 200-liter scale. Pursuant to the agreement, we collaborated with Therapure to construct a production area for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE in Therapure's existing manufacturing facility in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Therapure manufactures ARIKAYCE for us on a non-exclusive basis. The agreement has an initial term of five years from the first date on which Therapure delivers ARIKAYCE to us after we obtain permits related to the manufacture of ARIKAYCE, and will renew automatically for successive periods of two years each, unless terminated by either party by providing the required two years' prior written notice to the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties have rights and obligations under the agreement prior to the commencement of the initial term. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay certain minimum amounts for the batches of ARIKAYCE produced each calendar year. The agreement allows for termination by either party upon the occurrence of certain events, including (i) the material breach by the other party of any provision of the agreement or the quality agreement expected to be entered into between the parties, and (ii) the default or bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon no fewer than 180 days' advance notice. 
 



SynteractHCR, Inc. (Synteract) 


               We entered into a services agreement with Synteract pursuant to which we retained Synteract to perform implementation and management services in connection with the 212 study. We may 
 17

   terminate the services agreement or any work order for any reason and without cause with 30 days' written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or, bankruptcy petition by the other party or, if any approval from a regulatory authority is revoked, suspended or expires without renewal. We anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders for the 212 study will be approximately $45 million over the period of the study. In April 2015, we entered into a work order with Synteract to perform implementation and management services for the 312 study. We anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders for the 312 study will be approximately $25 million over the period of the study. 
 



Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (CFFT) 


               In 2004 and 2009, we entered into research funding agreements with CFFT whereby we received $1.7 million and $2.2 million for each respective agreement in research funding for the development of ARIKAYCE. If ARIKAYCE becomes an approved product for CF in the US, we will owe a payment to CFFT of up to $13.4 million that is payable over a three-year period after approval as a commercialized drug in the US. Furthermore, if certain global sales milestones are met within five years of the drug commercialization, we would owe an additional payment of $3.9 million. Under the 2009 agreement, in the event we terminate development of ARIKAYCE for CF prior to first commercial sale of a product containing ARIKAYCE for a period of 360 continuous days, and such termination is not for reasons outside of our reasonable control, then at CFFT's election and within 180 days of such termination, CFFT (1) may elect to develop ARIKAYCE and (2) will have the right to receive from us an exclusive (subject to certain exceptions), royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use, develop, sell and commercialize a product containing ARIKAYCE in the treatment of certain infections in CF patients or pulmonary disease. 
 



INS1007-related License Agreement 


               In October 2016, we entered into the AZ License Agreement, pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing AZD7986 (renamed INS1007). In consideration of the licenses and other rights granted by AstraZeneca, we made an upfront payment of $30.0 million in late October 2016. We are obligated to make a series of contingent milestone payments to AstraZeneca totaling up to an additional $85.0 million upon the achievement of clinical development and regulatory filing milestones. If we elect to develop INS1007 for a second indication, we will be obligated to make an additional series of contingent milestone payments totaling up to $42.5 million. We are not obligated to make any additional milestone payments for any additional indications. In addition, we have agreed to pay AstraZeneca tiered royalties ranging from a high single-digit to mid-teen on net sales of any approved product based on INS1007 and one additional payment of $35.0 million upon the first achievement of $1 billion in annual net sales. The AZ License Agreement provides AstraZeneca with the option to negotiate a future agreement with us for commercialization of INS1007 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our agreements with AstraZeneca (including, among other things, if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on INS1007, or we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency), AstraZeneca would have the right to terminate the license. 
 



INS1009-related Agreement 


               In November 2015, we entered into an agreement with Respironics Inc., a division of Philips (Respironics), for the clinical supply of nebulizers to be used in the development of INS1009 for PAH. The agreement calls for payments to Respironics upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones 
 18

   relating to the development of INS1009, aggregating to $7.6 million. In addition, we will be required to pay a royalty on net sales of the product, if any. 
   Competition 
               The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. We face potential competitors from many different areas including commercial pharmaceutical, biotech and device companies, academic institutions and scientists, other smaller or earlier stage companies and non-profit organizations developing anti-infective drugs and drugs for respiratory diseases. Many of these companies have greater human and financial resources and may have product candidates in more advanced stages of development and may reach the market before our product candidates. Competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer or less expensive or that have better tolerability or convenience. We also may face generic competitors where third-party payers will encourage use of the generic products. Although we believe that our formulation delivery technology, respiratory and anti-infective expertise, experience and knowledge in our specific areas of focus provide us with competitive advantages, these potential competitors could reduce our commercial opportunity. Additionally, there currently are, and in the future there may be, already-approved products for certain of the indications for which we are developing, or in the future may choose to develop, our product candidates. For instance, PAH is a competitive indication with established products, including other formulations of treprostinil. 




NTM lung disease competitive overview 


               In the NTM lung disease market, our major competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have approved therapies or therapies in development for the treatment of chronic lung infections. While some companies have expressed interest in studying their products for NTM, we are not aware of any companies that are currently conducting clinical trials for the treatment of refractory NTM lung disease or of any approved inhaled therapies specifically indicated for refractory NTM lung infections in North America, Europe or Japan, but, as previously described, there is an ATS/IDSA-recommended treatment regimen that is utilized. 
   Government Regulation 
 



Orphan Drug Designation 


United States 


               Under the Orphan Drug Act (ODA), the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition (for the purposes of the ODA, "rare" is generally defined as a disease or condition for which the drug is intended affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US) if it meets certain criteria specified by the ODA and FDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the drug and the specific intended use(s) for which it has obtained designation are listed by the FDA in a publicly-accessible database. The FDA has designated ARIKAYCE as an orphan drug for treatment of (i) infections caused by NTM, (ii) bronchiectasis in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other susceptible microbial pathogens and (iii) bronchopulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF patients. 
               Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor for various development incentives of the ODA, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the NDA user fee (unless the application seeks approval for an indication not included in the orphan drug designation). Orphan drug designation also affords the company a period of marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug. Specifically, the first NDA applicant with an FDA orphan drug designation for a particular active 
 19

   moiety to receive FDA approval of the drug for an indication covered by the orphan designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period, often referred to as orphan drug exclusivity, in the US for that drug and indication. A product that has several separate orphan designations may have several separate market exclusivities. During the orphan drug exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for use, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product that has orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition or the same drug for a different disease or condition, and it does not alter the timing or scope of the regulatory review and approval process; the sponsor must still submit evidence from clinical and non-clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. 
 



European Union 


               The European Commission grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of drugs or biologics (1) for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, or (2) for life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU where, without incentives, sales of the drug in the European Economic Area (the European Union plus Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway) (EEA) are unlikely to be sufficient to justify its development. Orphan drug designation is available either if no other satisfactory method of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition is approved in the EEA or if such a method does exist but the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. The European Commission has granted an orphan designation for ARIKAYCE for the treatment of NTM lung disease. 
               If a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives a marketing authorization for a therapeutic indication which is covered by such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity means that the EMA or national medicines agency may not accept another application for authorization, or grant an authorization, for a same or similar drug for the same therapeutic indication. Competitors may receive such a marketing authorization despite orphan exclusivity, provided that they demonstrate that the existing orphan product is not supplied in sufficient quantities or that the 'second' drug or biologic is clinically superior to the existing orphan product. The 'second' drug may but need not have an orphan designation as well. The period of orphan exclusivity is ten years, which can be extended by two years where an agreed pediatric investigation plan has been implemented. The exclusivity period may also be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Each orphan designation carries the potential for one market exclusivity for all the therapeutic indications that are covered by the designation. A product that has several separate orphan designations may have several separate market exclusivities. 
               Orphan drug designation also provides opportunities for free protocol assistance and fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedure or fee exemptions for companies with a small and medium enterprises status. In addition, Member States may provide national benefits to orphan drugs, such as early access to the reimbursement procedure or exemption from any turnover tax imposed on pharmaceutical companies. 
               The orphan designation may be applied for at any time during the development of the drug but before the application for marketing authorization. At the time of marketing authorization, the criteria for orphan designation are examined again, and the Commission decides on the maintenance of the orphan designation. The non-maintenance of the orphan designation means that the drug loses its orphan status and thus no longer benefits from orphan exclusivity, fee reductions or exemptions, and national benefits.

Drug Approval 


United States 


               In the US, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other government bodies. The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable US requirements at any time during product development, approval, or after approval may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to file or approve new drug applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The description below summarizes the current approval process in the US for our product candidates. 
 



Preclinical Studies 


               Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, and pharmacology, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including the FDA's good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations and the US Department of Agriculture's regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND application. Certain non-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 



Clinical Trials 


               Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects (healthy volunteers or patients) under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with all applicable federal regulations and guidance, including those pertaining to good clinical practice (GCP) standards that are meant to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors as well as (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing of a new drug in the US (whether in patients or healthy volunteers) must be included as a submission to the IND, and the FDA must be notified of subsequent protocol amendments, including new protocols. In addition, the protocol must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB), and all study subjects must provide informed consent. Typically, before any clinical trial, each institution participating in the trial will require review of the protocol before the trial commences at that institution. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and there are additional, more frequent reporting requirements for certain adverse events. 
 21

                 A study sponsor might choose to discontinue a clinical trial or a clinical development program for a variety of reasons. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
               Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential pre-approval phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, short term (typically less than a few months) testing is conducted in a small group of subjects (typically 20-100), who may be patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers, to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. In Phase 2, the drug is given to a larger group of subjects (typically up to several hundred) with the target condition to further evaluate its safety and gather preliminary evidence of efficacy. Phase 3 studies typically last between several months and two years. In Phase 3, the drug is given to a large group of subjects with the target disease or condition (typically several hundred to several thousand), often at multiple geographical sites, to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, and collect data to support drug approval. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases of development and obtain marketing approval. 
 



NDA 


               After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA can be prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the US. The NDA is a large submission that must include, among other things, the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The application also includes representative samples, copies of all drug product labeling, patent information, and a financial certification or disclosure statement. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and annual product and establishment user fees also apply, which typically increase annually. 
               The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application is accepted for filing based on the FDA's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes outside clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
               Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations, that the drug is safe and effective in the indication(s) studied. The FDA also reviews the proposed labeling submitted with the NDA and typically requires changes in the labeling text. 
               After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing and testing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. Complete response letters generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and delineate the additional testing or information needed in order for 
 22

   the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter, which may specify post approval requirements, authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the approved indication or indications and the other conditions of use set out in the approved prescribing information. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Under priority review status, the FDA has 180 days from the date of an NDA filing to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. In practice, however, the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act have effectively extended the initial review cycle beyond 180 days. The FDA's current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months of filing and within six months of filing for priority NDAs (two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs for a new molecular entity (NME) after the FDA receives an application for the agency to determine whether the application may be filed). 
               As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing, known as phase 4 studies, to be conducted in order to gather additional information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Beyond routine post marketing safety surveillance, the FDA may require specific additional surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions that can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. As a condition of approval, or after approval, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS may include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. Further post-approval requirements are discussed below. 
 



Expedited Review and Approval of Eligible Drugs 


               Accelerated approval regulations allow certain drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions to be approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints (i.e., clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity) or intermediate clinical endpoints, which can substantially reduce time to approval. A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a markera laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept the proposed surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. 
               As a condition of approval, the FDA may require certain adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit of the product, and may impose restrictions on distribution to assure safe use. Post marketing studies would usually be required to be studies already underway at the time of the accelerated approval. In addition, promotional materials for an accelerated approval drug to be used in the first 120 days post-approval must be submitted to the FDA prior to approval, and materials to be used after that 120-day period must be submitted 30 days prior to first use. If the required post-marketing studies fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug, or if the applicant fails to perform the required post-marketing studies with due diligence, the FDA may withdraw approval of the drug under streamlined procedures in accordance with the agency's regulations. The agency may also withdraw approval of a drug if, among other things, the promotional 
 23

   materials for the product are false or misleading, or other evidence demonstrates that the drug product is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use. 
               The FDA also has various programsfast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough designationthat are intended to expedite or streamline the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. The programs each have different eligibility criteria and provide different benefits, and can be applied either alone or in combination depending on an applicant's circumstances. Fast track designation applies to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and for which nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. It should be requested at the time of IND submission or ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA must respond to requests for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the request. If granted, the applicant is eligible for actions to expedite development and review, such as frequent interaction with the review team, as well as for rolling review, meaning that the applicant may submit sections of the application as they are available. The timing of FDA's review of these sections depends on a number of factors, and the review clock does not start running until the agency has received a complete NDA submission. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if the agency determines that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
               Priority review applies to an application (both original and efficacy supplement) for a drug that treats a serious condition and that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. It also applies to any supplement that proposes a labeling change pursuant to a report on a pediatric study. A request for priority review is submitted at the time of NDA or supplemental NDA submission. The FDA must respond within 60 days of receipt of the request. If granted, the review time is shortened from the standard 10 months to 6 months, with two additional months in the case of a NME. 
               Breakthrough therapy designation applies to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. It can be requested with the IND submission and ideally no later than the end-of-phase 2 meeting. The FDA must respond within 60 days of receipt of the request. If granted, the applicant receives intensive guidance on efficient drug development, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced review and regulatory health project management staff in a proactive, collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, rolling review, and other actions to expedite review. Designation may be rescinded if the product no longer meets the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation. ARIKAYCE has been designated as a breakthrough therapy. 
               Drugs that are designated as QIDPs are eligible for priority review and fast track designation, and well as market exclusivity. A product is eligible if it is an antibacterial or anti-fungal drug for human use that is intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including: those caused by an anti-bacterial or anti-fungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or caused by qualifying pathogens listed by the FDA. A drug sponsor may request that the FDA designate its product as a QIDP at any time prior to NDA submission. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of receiving the designation request. ARIKAYCE has been designated as a QIDP for NTM lung disease.

Exclusivities 


               After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension on a single patent. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug's testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval) up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
               A variety of non-patent exclusivity periods are available under the FDCA that can delay the submission or approval of certain applications for competing products. 
               A five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the US is granted to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity (NCE). An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety (the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance) that has been approved by the FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the Act. During the exclusivity period for a NCE, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references (i.e., relies on FDA prior approval of) the NCE drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement with respect to a patent listed with the FDA for the reference NDA. 
               A three-year period of non-patent exclusivity is granted for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved, when the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations, which means that the FDA may approve applications for other versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Where this form of exclusivity applies, it prevents FDA approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA subject to the exclusivity for the three-year period; however, the FDA may accept and review ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs during the three-year period. 
               These exclusivities also do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a duplicate version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
               Products with QIDP designation may receive a five-year extension of other non-patent exclusivities for which the drug is also eligible. The exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a subsequent application for a change to the QIDP-designated drug that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing, schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength. For example, an approved product with orphan designation and QIDP designation, like ARIKAYCE, would have 12 years of marketing exclusivity.

Medical Device Regulation 


               Medical devices, such as the eFlow Nebulizer System, may receive marketing authorization from the FDA as stand-alone devices, or in some cases, may receive marketing authorization as part of a combination product. In either case, the ultimate product will need to satisfy FDA requirements. The primary pathways for marketing authorization for devices in the US are 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (PMA). 
               Medical devices are also subject to certain post-clearance, post-approval requirements. Those requirements include continuing Quality System Regulation compliance, Medical Device Reporting, Correction and Removal, and requirements governing labeling and promotional advertising. 
               The FDCA permits medical devices intended for investigational use to be shipped to clinical sites if such devices comply with prescribed procedures and conditions. Devices intended for investigational use may be exempted from premarket notification and premarket approval requirements when shipped for use in clinical trials, but they must bear a label indicating that they are for investigational use. This labeling may not represent that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated. 
 



Combination Products 


               A combination product is a product comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and device) that are combined into a single product, co-packaged, or sold separately but intended for co-administration, as evidenced by the labeling for the products. A drug that is administered using a nebulizer, such as ARIKAYCE or INS1009, is an example of a combination drug/device product. 
               The FDA is divided into various Centers, which each have authority over a specific type of product. NDAs are reviewed by personnel within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, while device applications and premarket notifications are reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. When reviewing a drug/device combination product, the FDA must assign a lead Center to review the product, based on the combination product's primary mode of action (PMOA), which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. In addition, the Office of Combination Products (OCP) oversees the alignment of feedback regarding reviews involving multiple Centers and ensures that each Center completes its review and provides results to the lead Center in a timely manner. 
               When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers and apply the standards that would be applicable but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Depending on the type of combination product, approval or clearance could be obtained through submission of a single marketing application or through separate applications for the individual constituent parts (i.e., an NDA for the drug and a premarket notification for the device). The FDCA directs the FDA to conduct a review of a combination product under a single marketing application whenever appropriate. This application is submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator. The agency has the discretion to require 
 26

   separate applications to more than one Center, and applicants may choose to submit separate applications for constituent parts of a combination (unless the FDA determines one application is necessary). One reason to submit multiple applications is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each application is generally reviewed by the Center with authority over each application type. For combination products that contain an approved constituent part (such as a drug-device combination product in which the device has previously received clearance), the FDA may require that the application(s) include only such information as is necessary to meet the standard for clearance or approval, taking into account any prior finding of safety or effectiveness for the approved constituent part. 
               Like their constituent productse.g., drugs and devicescombination products are highly regulated and subject to a broad range of post marketing requirements including cGMPs, adverse event reporting, periodic reports, labeling and advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions. 
 



Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 


               Under US and certain foreign laws intended to improve clinical trial transparency, sponsors of clinical trials may be required to register and disclose certain information about their clinical trials. This can include information related to the investigational drug, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial. This information is then made publicly available. Under a recently revised regulation in the US, sponsors are obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion (prior to the new rulemaking, disclosure of results was only required if the product or new indication was approved by the FDA). In the US, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor is seeking approval of the product or a new indication. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 



Other Post-approval Regulatory Requirements 


               Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including those relating to advertising, promotion, adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, and cGMP, as well as registration, listing, and inspection. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
               The FDA regulates the content and format of prescription drug labeling, advertising, and promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional Internet communications. FDA also establishes parameters for permissible non-promotional communications between industry and the medical community, including industry-supported scientific and educational activities. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion for uses not consistent with the approved labeling, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under both the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act. 
               Manufacturers are subject to requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports following FDA approval of an NDA. 
               All aspects of pharmaceutical manufacture must conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA 
 27

   during which the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. 
               Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, product formulation, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, in some cases before the change may be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
               As previously mentioned, the FDA also may require phase 4 studies and may require a REMS, which could restrict the distribution or use of the product. 
               In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 



European Union 


Marketing Authorization Application 


               To obtain approval of a drug under the EU regulatory system, an application for a marketing authorization may be submitted under a centralized, a decentralized or a national procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes or for orphan drugs, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states, which grants the same rights and obligations in each member state as a national marketing authorization. As a general rule, only one marketing authorization may be granted for drugs approved through the centralized procedure and the marketing authorization is also relevant for the EEA countries. 
               Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. More specifically, on day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur designated by the CHMP, it adopts a list of questions, which are sent to the applicant together with the CHMP's overall conclusions. Applicants then have three months to respond to the CHMP (and can request a three-month extension). The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur assess the applicant's replies, revise the assessment report as necessary and may prepare a list of outstanding issues. The revised assessment report and list of outstanding issues are sent to the applicant together with the CHMP's recommendation by day 180 of the procedure. Applicants then have one month to respond to the CHMP (and can request a one or two-month extension). The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur assess the applicant's replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and prepare a final assessment report. Once its scientific evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to 
 28

   whether to grant the marketing authorization. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the Standing Committee of the Member States. The European Commission prepares a draft decision and circulates it to the member states; if the draft decision differs from the CHMP opinion, the Commission must provide detailed explanations. The European Commission adopts a decision within 15 days of the end of the consultation procedure. 
 



Accelerated Procedure, Conditional Approval and Approval Under
Exceptional Circumstances 


               Various programs, including accelerated procedure, conditional approval and approval under exceptional circumstances, are intended to expedite or simplify the approval of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard approval procedures. 
               For drugs which are of major interest from the point of view of public health, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, applicants may submit a substantiated request for accelerated assessment. If the CHMP accepts the request, the review time is reduced from 210 to 150 days. 
               Furthermore, for certain categories of medicinal products, marketing authorizations may be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs of patients or in the interest of public health. In such cases, the company may request, or the CHMP may recommend, the granting of a marketing authorization, subject to certain specific obligations; such marketing authorization may be conditional or under exceptional circumstances. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to applications for a conditional marketing authorization or marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. 
               Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) the applicant will likely be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
               Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis until the holder provides a comprehensive data package. The granting of conditional marketing authorization depends on the applicant's ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline. They are subject to "conditions", i.e. the holder is required to complete ongoing studies or to conduct new studies with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive or to fulfill specific obligations in relation to pharmacovigilance. Once the holder has provided a comprehensive data package, the conditional marketing authorization is replaced by a 'regular' marketing authorization. 
               Marketing authorizations under exceptional circumstances may be granted where the applicant demonstrates that, for objective and verifiable reasons, they are unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the drug under normal conditions of use. Such marketing authorizations are subject to certain conditions, in particular relating to safety of the drug, notification of incidents relating to its use or actions to be taken. They are valid for an indefinite period of time, but the conditions upon which they are based are subject to an annual reassessment in order to ensure that the risk-benefit balance remains positive. 
 29

   



Exclusivities 


               If an approved drug contains a new active substance, it is protected by data exclusivity for eight years from the notification of the Commission decision granting the marketing authorization and then by marketing protection for an additional two or three years. Overall, the drug is protected for ten or eleven years against generic competition, and no additional exclusivity protection is granted for any new development of the active substance it contains. 
               During the eight-year period of data exclusivity, competitors may not refer to the marketing authorization dossier of the approved drug for regulatory purposes. During the period of marketing protection, competitors may not market their generic drugs. The period of marketing protection is normally two years but may become three years if, during the eight-year data exclusivity period, a new therapeutic indication is approved that is considered as bringing a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies. 
 



Medical Devices Regulations 


               In the EU, the marketing of medical devices is not subject to a prior approval by a health authority, but, depending on the class of device, may require prior review by a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are technical review bodies that are accredited and supervised by national health authorities. They conduct conformity assessment procedures of, among others, medical devices. 
               Medical devices are generally governed by Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices that harmonizes the conditions for placing medical devices on the European market. This Directive however does not regulate certain important marketing aspects, such as advertising or pricing and reimbursement, which remain governed by national law. 
               Directive 93/42 requires medical devices to meet the essential requirements which are enumerated in the annexes to the Directive. Compliance with those requirements is demonstrated by the CE mark as the manufacturer may only affix the CE mark if it may declare conformity with the essential requirement for each medical device that is marketed. Directive 93/42 provides recourse to harmonized European standards in order to facilitate compliance with the essential requirements. Harmonized standards provide a presumption of conformity with the essential requirements. 
               Directive 93/42 institutes several conformity assessment procedures. The relevant conformity assessment procedure depends on the type of medical device and the risks involved. Devices are divided in four groups: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III. Class I devices present the lowest level of risk so that, for most of these devices the manufacturer can self-certify the product and need not rely on certification by a Notified Body. For the other classes, a Notified Body must review the manufacturer's procedures and/or the product. Every device is initially classified by the manufacturer. However, the Notified Body may dispute the classification and assert that the device should be included in a class requiring stricter conformity assessment procedures. Specific rules apply to custom-made medical devices, medical devices that are used in clinical trials, and medical devices that incorporate a medicinal ingredient. 
               For classes of devices other than Class I, a manufacturer must have a Notified Body test and certify conformity of its design and production procedures or its products with the essential requirements of Directive 93/42. Certification takes the form of a certificate of conformity issued by the Notified Body, which is valid throughout the European Union. Upon certification by the Notified Body, the manufacturer affixes the CE mark to the medical device, which allows the product to move freely within the EU and thus prevents EU Member States from restricting sales and marketing of the 
 30

   devices, unless such measure is justified on the basis of evidence of non-compliance. Ultimately, the manufacturer is responsible for the conformity of the device with the essential requirements and for the affixing of the CE mark. The eFlow Nebulizer System is CE marked by PARI in the EU. 
               Manufacturers of medical devices are subject to materiovigilance obligations that require reporting of incidents or near incidents related to the use of a medical device, which incidents may demonstrate the need for corrective action by the manufacturer. In addition, Notified Bodies regularly re-assess the conformity of a medical device to the essential requirements of Directive 93/42 and may from time to time audit the manufacturer and may, where needed, suspend or withdraw the manufacturer's certificate of conformity. 
 



Japan 


               The Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare is the government agency that provides regulatory approval for pharmaceutical products in Japan. Parties engaged in manufacture or sale of products in Japan must receive the approval of the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. The Pharmaceutical Affairs Law of Japan requires a license for marketing authorization when importing to Japan and selling pharmaceutical products manufactured in other countries. It also requires a foreign manufacturer to get each of its manufacturing sites certified as a manufacturing site of pharmaceutical products to be marketed in Japan. To receive a license for marketing authorization, the manufacturer or seller must, at the very least, employ certain manufacturing marketing, quality and safety personnel. A license for marketing authorization may not be granted if the quality management methods and post marketing safety management methods applied with respect to the pharmaceutical product fail to conform to the standards stipulated in the ordinances promulgated by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. 
               In addition to the licensing requirements for entities that engage in manufacturing, importing and sales of medical products as mentioned above, the law also requires that the medical products have obtained approval before they are marketed and sold in Japan. The process for the approval includes such elements as evaluation and testing of trustworthiness of the clinical trial, testing of quality, efficacy, absorption and egestion, toxicity, and safety of the products. The time required for the approval process varies depending on the product, but it can take years. The product also needs approval for pricing to be applied for redemption of health insurance. The medical products which once are approved and marketed are also subject to regular post-marketing vigilance of safety and quality under the standards of Good Manufacturing Practice. 
 



Pediatric Information 


United States 


               Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), NDAs and NDA supplements must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), pediatric research is incentivized by the possibility of six additional months of pediatric exclusivity, which if granted, is added to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms listed for the applicable drug in the FDA's Orange Book at the time the sponsor satisfies the FDA's "written request" for pediatric research. Sponsors may seek to negotiate the terms of a written request during drug development. While the 
 31

   sponsor of an orphan designated drug may not be required to perform pediatric studies under PREA, they are eligible to participate in the incentives under the BPCA. 
 



European Union 


               In the EU, new drugs (i.e. drugs containing a new active substance) for adults, must also be tested in children. This mandatory pediatric testing is carried out through the implementation of a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, which is proposed by the applicant and approved by the EMA. A PIP contains all the studies to be conducted and measures to be taken in order to support the approval of the new drug, including pediatric pharmaceutical forms, in all subsets of the pediatric population. Validation of the marketing authorization application for adults is subject to the implementation of the PIP, subject to one or more waivers or deferrals. On the one hand, the PIP may allow a deferral for one or more of the studies or measures included therein in order not to delay the approval of the drug in adults, and, on another hand, the EMA may grant either a product-specific waiver for the (adult) disease/condition or one or more pediatric subsets or a class waiver for the disease/condition. PIPs are subject to modifications from time to time, when they no longer are workable. Prior to obtaining the validation of a marketing authorization application for adults, the applicant has to demonstrate compliance with the PIP at the time of submission of the application. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years. 
 



Regulation Outside the US, Europe and Japan 


               In addition to regulations in the US, Europe and Japan, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies of our candidate products, including medical devices. Regardless of whether we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product candidate (including a medical device) by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the US before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product candidate in those countries. The requirements for approval and the approval process vary from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Under certain harmonized medical device approval/clearance regulations outside the US, reference to US clearance permits fast-tracking of market clearance. Other regions are harmonized with EU standards, and therefore recognize the CE mark as a declaration of conformity to applicable standards. Furthermore, we must obtain any required pricing approvals in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching a product candidate in the approving country. 
 



Health Canada 


               Health Canada (HC) is the government agency that provides regulatory and marketing approval for drugs and therapeutic products in Canada. The ongoing Legislative and Regulatory Modernization (LRM) is the most significant drug regulatory system reform in Canada in more than 50 years and is expected to overhaul Canada's Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. The LRM supports a 'lifecycle' regulatory approach and is focused on strengthening evidence-based decision making, good regulatory planning, licensing, post-licensing, accountability, authority and enforcement. Through this framework, HC intends to improve the market authorization process and implement necessary regulatory frameworks. In October 2010, HC accelerated its modernization efforts. This included the proposed regulatory pathways for orphan drugs (harmonized with US/EU regulations).

Australia 


               The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is the regulatory body, under the Australian Department of Health, responsible for conducting assessment and monitoring activities of therapeutic goods in Australia. Products under the jurisdiction of the TGA include prescription medicines, medical devices (simple and complex), diagnostic products, vaccines, and biologics. Activities of the TGA include classifying the product based on risk to the person, implementing appropriate regulatory controls for the manufacturing processes, and monitoring approved products with a comprehensive adverse event reporting program. The TGA requires that a marketing authorization be submitted and reviewed for safety and efficacy, and approved before a medication can be marketed and provided to patients commercially. A separate regulatory pathway is utilized to conduct clinical trials in Australia. Australia has also an Orphan drug designation. 
   Early Access Programs in the European Union 
               Under EU law, member states are authorized to adopt national legal regimes for the supply or use of non-authorized drugs in case of therapeutic needs. The most common national legal regimes are compassionate use programs and named patient sales, but other national regimes for early access may be available, depending on the member state. For drugs that must be approved through the centralized procedure, such as orphan drugs, compassionate use programs are also regulated at the European level. ARIKAYCE is available in certain European countries under early access programs. 
               Special programs can be set up to make available to patients with an unmet medical need a promising drug which has not yet been authorized for their condition ("compassionate use"). As a general rule, compassionate use programs can only be put in place for drugs or biologics that are expected to help patients with life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously disabling illnesses who currently cannot be treated satisfactorily with authorized medicines, or who have a disease for which no medicine has yet been authorized. The compassionate use route may be a way for patients who cannot enroll in an ongoing clinical trial to obtain treatment with a potentially life-saving medicine. Compassionate use programs are coordinated and implemented by the EU member states, which decide independently how and when to open such programs according to national rules and legislation. Generally, doctors who wish to obtain a promising drug for their seriously ill patients will need to contact the relevant national authority in their respective country and follow the procedure that has been set up. Typically, the national authority keeps a register of the patients treated with the drug within the compassionate use program, and a system is in place to record any side effects reported by the patients or their doctors. Orphan drugs very often are subject to compassionate use programs due to their very nature (rare diseases are life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously disabling diseases) and the long time required for both their approval and effective marketing. 
               Doctors can also obtain certain drugs for their patients by requesting a supply of a drug from the manufacturer or a pharmacist located in another country, to be used for an individual patient under their direct responsibility. This is often called treatment on a 'named-patient basis' and is distinct from compassionate use programs. In this case, the doctor responsible for the treatment will either contact the manufacturer directly or issue a prescription to be fulfilled by a pharmacist. While manufacturers or pharmacists do record what they supply, there is no central register of the patients that are being treated in this way. 
   Reimbursement of Pharmaceutical Products 
               In the US, many independent third-party payers, as well as the Medicare and state Medicaid programs, reimburse buyers of pharmaceutical products. Medicare is the federal program that provides 
 33

   health care benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons. Medicaid is the need-based federal and state program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain persons. 
               As one of the conditions for obtaining Medicaid and Medicare Part B coverage for our marketed pharmaceutical products, we will need to agree to pay a rebate to state Medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for those products. We will also have to agree to sell our commercial products under contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated by federal statutes to receive drugs at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to commercial pharmaceutical distributors. These programs and contracts are highly regulated and will impose restrictions on our business. Failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for our drugs once approved. We may also be subject to penalties for improper marketing, including off-label marketing, of our drugs that are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid. 
               Private healthcare payers also attempt to control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. The newly elected US President has indicated an interest in having the federal government negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
               Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to patients. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drugs, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
   Fraud and Abuse and Other Laws 
               Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers (government or private) often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of health care products. In the US and most jurisdictions, numerous detailed requirements apply to government and private health care programs, and a broad range of fraud and abuse and transparency laws are relevant to pharmaceutical companies. US federal and state healthcare laws and regulations in these areas include the following:


· The federal anti-kickback statute; · The federal civil False Claims Act; · The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as
amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and similar state privacy laws; 

 34

   

· The federal criminal false statements statute; · The price reporting requirements under the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program and the Veterans
Health Care Act of 1992; · The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments
Program; and · Analogous and similar state laws and regulations. 

               Similar restrictions apply in the member states of the EU, which have been set out by laws or industry codes of conducts. 
   Employees 
               As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 161 employees, including 86 in research, clinical, regulatory, medical affairs and quality assurance; 17 in technical operations, manufacturing and quality control; 42 in general and administrative functions; and 16 in pre-commercial activities. We had 140 employees in the US and 21 employees in Europe. We anticipate increasing our headcount in 2017. 
               None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good. Generally, our employees are at-will employees; however, we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers.
