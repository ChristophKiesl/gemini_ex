Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
HRG
Overview
We are a holding company that conducts its operations principally through its operating subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2017, our principal operating subsidiaries include the following: (i) Spectrum Brands, our subsidiary that provides global branded consumer products; (ii) FGL, our subsidiary that provides life insurance and annuity products; and (iii) Front Street, our subsidiary engaged in the business of providing long-term reinsurance, including reinsurance to the specialty insurance sector of fixed, deferred and payout annuities. In addition, we own 99.5% of NZCH Corporation, a public shell company, and Salus, which was established to serve as a secured asset-based lender and is in the process of completing the wind-down of its business. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1954 under the name Zapata Corporation and reincorporated in Nevada in April 1999 under the same name. On December 23, 2009, we reincorporated in Delaware under the name Harbinger Group Inc. Effective March 9, 2015, we changed our name from Harbinger Group Inc. to HRG Group, Inc. Our Common Stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “HRG.” Our principal executive offices are located at 450 Park Avenue, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
We currently present the results of our operations in two reportable segments: (i) Consumer Products, which consists of Spectrum Brands and (ii) Corporate and Other. For the results of operations by segment and other segment data, see Part IV, Item 15. “Note 23, Segment and Geographic Data” to HRG’s Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.
For detailed information about revenues, operating income and total assets of HRG and its operating subsidiaries, see the financial statements beginning on page F-1 and S-1, respectively, of this report.
Strategy
During Fiscal 2017, we continued to streamline our business and simplify our holding company structure. For Fiscal 2017, we also continued to review and evaluate strategic alternatives available to us with a view towards maximizing shareholder value. We believe that HRG is an excellent company that owns great businesses that have generated strong performance over a long period of time. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that may be available to us through the review of strategic alternatives. Strategic alternatives may include, but are not limited to, a merger, sale or other business combination involving the Company and/or its assets. As part of this strategic review process, HRG has made/received, and may in the future make/receive, one or more proposals to/from third parties and/or Spectrum Brands, its management, its board of directors, its stockholders and other persons, including discussions and proposals that may include, but are not limited to, a merger or a sale and/or a business combination of the Company and Spectrum Brands. In connection therewith, the Spectrum Brands board of directors has formed a special committee of independent directors and has hired independent financial and legal advisors. We have not set a definitive schedule to complete our review of strategic alternatives and do not intend to provide any further updates until such time as it determines in its sole discretion or as required by law. The strategic review process may be suspended or terminated at any time without notice. There can be no assurance that any such process will result in a transaction, or if a transaction is undertaken, as to its terms or timing.

On May 24, 2017, FGL entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “FGL Merger Agreement”) with CF Corporation (“CF Corp”), FGL U.S. Holdings Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Corp (“CF/FGL US”), and FGL Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of CF/FGL US, pursuant to which CF Corp has agreed to acquire FGL for $31.10 per share (the “FGL Merger”). In addition, Front Street has agreed to sell (the “Front Street Sale”) to CF/FGL US all of the issued and outstanding shares of (i) Front Street Cayman and (ii) Front Street Bermuda (collectively, the “Acquired Companies”) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Front Street Purchase Agreement”). The purchase price is $65.0 million, subject to customary adjustments for transaction expenses. The Front Street Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and indemnification obligations. The required regulatory approvals in connection with the Front Street Sale have been received and the closing of the transaction is expected to take place before the end of calendar year 2017, subject to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including the consummation of the FGL Merger. The closing of the FGL Merger is not conditioned upon the closing of the Front Street Sale.
See Part I, Item 1. “Business-FGL-The FGL Merger” of this report for further information.
Competition
We and our subsidiaries face intense competition from a variety of sources in carrying out our respective businesses and achieving our objectives. Many of our competitors may be better established, possess greater human and other resources than us, and our financial resources may be relatively limited when compared with many of these competitors. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in contrast to our competitors. See elsewhere in this report for discussion of competition faced by our subsidiaries. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to HRG-Our subsidiaries operate in highly-competitive industries, limiting their ability to gain or maintain their positions in their respective industries.”
Employees
At September 30, 2017, HRG employed 13 persons and HRG’s subsidiaries employed approximately 17,100 persons. In the normal course of business, HRG and its subsidiaries use contract personnel to supplement their employee base to meet business needs. As of September 30, 2017, none of HRG’s employees were represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. See the remainder of this report for additional information regarding the employees of HRG’s subsidiaries. HRG believes that its overall relationship with its employees is good.

Sales, Distribution and Competition 
Spectrum Brands sells its products through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, e-commerce and online retailers, wholesalers and distributors, hearing aid professionals, construction companies and OEMs. Spectrum Brands’ sales generally are made through the use of individual purchase orders, consistent with industry practice. Retail sales of the consumer products that Spectrum Brands markets have been increasingly consolidated on a worldwide basis into a small number of regional and national mass merchandisers and e-commerce companies that generally have strong negotiating power with their suppliers. A significant percentage of Spectrum brands’ sales are attributable to a limited group of retailer customers, including (in alphabetical order), Amazon, Autozone, Dollar General, Lidl, Lowe’s, PetSmart, O’Reilly, Target, The Home Depot, and Wal-Mart. Spectrum Brands’ sales to its largest customer, Wal-Mart, represented approximately 15% of its consolidated net sales for Fiscal 2017. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of Spectrum Brands’ consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2017.
Factors influencing product sales include brand name recognition, perceived quality, price, performance, product packaging, design innovation, and consumer confidence and preferences as well as creative marketing, promotion and distribution strategies. Spectrum Brands competes for limited shelf space and consumer acceptance based on location and product segment. Spectrum Brands also competes with its retail customers, who use their own private label brands, and with distributors and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products, typically at lower prices. Spectrum Brands attempts to address these competitive challenges through a portfolio of well-recognized consumer product brands, business relationships with global retailers, distributors and wholesalers, an expansive distribution network, innovative new products, packaging and technologies and an experienced management team. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risk Related to Spectrum Brands’ Business-Spectrum Brands participates in very competitive markets and it may not be able to compete successfully, causing Spectrum Brands to lose market share and sales.”
Within Spectrum Brands’ GBA product line, primary competitors for consumer batteries include Energizer Holdings, Inc. (Energizer), Berkshire Hathaway (Duracell), Montana Tech Components AG (PowerOne), Matsushita (Panasonic) and private label brands of major retailers. Primary competitors for small appliances include Newell Brands (Sunbeam, Mr. Coffee, Crockpot, Oster), De’Longhi America (DeLonghi, Kenwood, Braun), SharkNinja (Shark, Ninja), Hamilton Beach Holding Co. (Hamilton Beach, Proctor Silex), Sensio, Inc. (Bella); SEB S.A.(T-fal, Krups, Rowenta), Whirlpool Corporation (Kitchen Aid), Conair Corporation (Cuisinart, Waring), Koninklijke Philips N.V. (Philips), Glen Dimplex (Morphy Richards) and private label brands for major retailers. Primary competitors in personal care include are Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. (Norelco), The Procter & Gamble Company (Braun), Conair Corporation, Wahl Clipper Corporation and Helen of Troy Limited.
Within Spectrum Brands’ HHI product line, primary competitors in security and residential locksets include Allegion (Schlage), Assa Abloy (Emtek, Yale) and private label import brands such as Defiant. Primary competitors for hardware include The Hillman Group, Hampton Hardware and private labels such as Crown Bolt. Primary competitors for plumbing include Masco (Delta), Fortune Brands (Moen), Kohler, American Standard, and private label brands such as Glacier Bay.
Primary competitors in Spectrum Brands’ PET product line are Mars Corporation, the Hartz Mountain Corporation and Central Garden & Pet Company which all sell a comprehensive line of pet supplies that compete across Spectrum Brands’ product categories. The pet supplies product category is highly fragmented with no competitor holding a substantial market share and consists of small companies with limited product lines.
Primary competitors in Spectrum Brands’ H&G product line are The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (Scotts, Ortho, Roundup, Miracle-Gro, Tomcat); Central Garden & Pet (AMDRO, Sevin), Bayer A.G. (Bayer Advanced), S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (Raid, OFF!); and Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (Combat).
Within Spectrum Brands’ GAC, primary competitors for appearance products are Meguairs, Turtle Wax, Black Magic, Mothers, and private label brands. Primary competitors in performance chemical products include Lucas, Gumout, Chevron, Prestone, and private label brands. Primary competitors for A/C recharge products primarily consist of private label brands. Spectrum Brands also encounters competition from similar and alternative products, many of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies such as Mothers, Meguiars, Lucas, and Sea Foam.
Seasonality 
On a consolidated basis, Spectrum Brands’ financial results are approximately equally weighted across the fiscal quarters, however, sales of certain product categories tend to be seasonal. Sales in Spectrum Brands’ GBA segment, primarily from consumer battery and electric personal care product categories tend to increase during the December holiday season (Spectrum Brands’ first fiscal quarter), while small appliances sales increase from July through December primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for “back-to-school” sales (Spectrum Brands’ fourth fiscal quarter) and in December for the holiday season. Sales in Spectrum Brands’ HHI segment primarily increase during the spring and summer construction period (Spectrum Brands’ third and fourth fiscal quarters). Sales in Spectrum Brands’ PET segment remain fairly consistent throughout the year with little variation. Sales in Spectrum Brands’ H&G segment and GAC segment typically peak during the first six months of the calendar year (Spectrum Brands’ second and third fiscal quarters) due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns and timing of promotional activities. 
11

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal raw materials used in manufacturing include zinc, electrolytic manganese dioxide used in Spectrum Brands’ consumer batteries products; brass and steel used in the manufacturing of Spectrum Brands’ HHI products, and refrigerant R-134a used in Spectrum Brands’ GAC A/C recharge products, that are sourced either on a global or regional basis. The prices of these raw materials are susceptible to fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, energy costs, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances. Spectrum Brands has regularly engaged in forward purchase and hedging derivative transactions in an attempt to effectively manage the raw material costs Spectrum Brands expects to incur over the next 12 to 24 months.
Substantially all of Spectrum Brands’ rechargeable batteries and chargers, portable lighting products, personal care and small appliances, and rawhide alternative products from Spectrum Brands’ recent PetMatrix acquisition are manufactured by third party suppliers that are primarily located in the Asia-Pacific region. Spectrum Brands maintains ownership of most of the tooling and molds used by its suppliers.
Spectrum Brands continually evaluates its manufacturing facilities’ capacity and related utilization. As a result of such analyses, Spectrum Brands has closed a number of manufacturing facilities during the past five years. In general, Spectrum Brands believes its existing facilities are adequate for its present and foreseeable needs.
Patents and Trademarks
Spectrum Brands uses and maintains a number of patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to its businesses. Spectrum Brands seeks trademark protection in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Spectrum Brands’ most significant registered trademarks are:

Product Line | Trademarks 
GBA | Rayovac®, VARTA®, Remington®, Black & Decker®, George Foreman®, Russell Hobbs®, Farberware®, Toastmaster®, Breadman®, Juiceman® 
HHI | Kwikset®, Weiser®, Baldwin®, National Hardware®, Stanley®, Fanal®, Pfister®, Tell® 
PET | Tetra®, 8-in-1®, Dingo®, Nature’s Miracle®, Wild Harvest®, Marineland®, Furminator®, Littermaid®, Birdola®, Healthy Hide®, Digest-eeze®, Iams®, Eukanuba®, SmartBone®, DreamBones®, GloFish®
H&G | Spectracide®, Cutter®, Hot Shot®, Real Kill®, Ultra Kill®, Black Flag®, Liquid Fence®, Rid-a-bug®, TAT®, Garden Safe®, Repel® 
GAC | Armor All®, STP®, A/C PRO® 

Spectrum Brands acquired the rights to the VARTA® trademark in the consumer battery category and Johnson Controls Inc. acquired rights to the trademark in the automotive battery category from VARTA AG. VARTA AG continues to have rights to use the trademark with travel guides and industrial batteries and VARTA Microbattery GmbH has the right to use the trademark with micro batteries. Spectrum Brands is a party to a Trademark and Domain Names Protection and Delimitation Agreement that governs ownership and usage rights and obligations of the parties relative to the VARTA® trademark.
Spectrum Brands licenses the Black & Decker® brand in North America, Latin America (excluding Brazil) and the Caribbean for four core categories of household appliances: beverage products, food preparation products, garment care products and cooking products through a trademark license agreement with The Black and Decker Corporation (“BDC”) through December 2018. Under the agreement, Spectrum Brands agreed to pay BDC royalties based on a percentage of sales, with minimum annual royalty payments of $15.0 million through calendar year 2018. The agreement also requires Spectrum Brands to comply with maximum annual return rates for products. If BDC does not agree to renew the license agreement, Spectrum Brands will have 18 months to transition out of the brand name with no minimum royalty payments during such transition period and BDC has agreed to not compete in the four categories for five years after the end of the transition period. Upon request, BDC may elect to extend the license to use the Black & Decker brand to certain additional product categories. BDC has approved several extensions of the license to additional categories and geographies.
Spectrum Brands owns the rights to use the Remington® trademark for electric shavers, shaver accessories, grooming products and personal care products; and Remington Arms Company, Inc. (“Remington Arms”) owns the rights to use the trademark for firearms, sporting goods and products for industrial use, including industrial hand tools. The terms of a 1986 agreement between Remington Products, LLC and Remington Arms provides for the shared rights to use the trademark on products which are not considered “principal products of interest” for either company. Spectrum Brands retains the trademark for nearly all products which Spectrum Brands believes can benefit from the use of the brand name in its distribution channels.
Spectrum Brands licenses the Stanley® and Black & Decker® marks and logos in the HHI segment for such products as residential locksets, builder’s hardware, padlocks, and door hardware through a transitional trademark license agreement with Stanley Black & Decker Corporation (“SBD”). Under the agreement and as part of the acquisition of the HHI Business in December 2012, Spectrum Brands has a royalty-free, fully paid license to use certain trademarks, brand names and logos in marketing its products and services for five years after the completion of the HHI Business acquisition. Spectrum Brands has amended the license agreement with SBD to extend the license agreement and allow for the continued use of the respective trademarks, brand names and logos in the HHI segment through December 2018. During this extension period, Spectrum Brands will pay to SBD royalties based on a percentage of sales. 
12

Spectrum Brands owns or licenses from third parties a significant number of patents and patent applications throughout the world relating to products that Spectrum Brands sells and manufacturing equipment that Spectrum Brands uses. Through Spectrum Brands’ GBA segment, Spectrum Brands holds a license that expires in March 2022 for certain alkaline battery designs, technology and manufacturing equipment from Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co., Ltd. (“Matsushita”), to whom Spectrum Brands pays a royalty. Through ownership of Shaser, Inc., Spectrum Brands has patented technology that is used in its i-Light and i-Light Reveal product line. Through Spectrum Brands’ HHI segment, Spectrum Brands owns the patented SmartKey® technology, which enables customers to easily rekey their locks without hiring a locksmith. Through Spectrum Brands’ acquisition of PetMatrix on June 1, 2017, Spectrum Brands owns patented technology for the development of edible rawhide-fee pet treats. Through Spectrum Brands’ acquisition of GloFish on May 12, 2017, Spectrum Brands owns patented technology used in the development and breeding of fluorescent ornamental fish.
Research and Development
Spectrum Brands’ research and development strategy is focused on new product development and performance enhancements of its existing products. Spectrum Brands plans to continue to use its strong brand names, established customer relationships and significant research and development efforts to introduce innovative products that offer enhanced value to consumers through new designs and improved functionality. During Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, Spectrum Brands invested $59.5 million, $58.7 million and $51.3 million, respectively, in product research and development.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
Due to the nature of Spectrum Brands’ operations, its facilities are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances at Spectrum Brands’ facilities. Spectrum Brands believes that compliance with the federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations to which it is subject will not have a material effect upon Spectrum Brands’ capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position.
From time to time, Spectrum Brands has been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of its properties. Spectrum Brands has not conducted invasive testing at all facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks. Given the age of its facilities and the nature of its operations, it is possible that material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with Spectrum Brands’ current or former facilities. If previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of its manufacturing facilities is discovered, Spectrum Brands could incur material unforeseen expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. Although Spectrum Brands is currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at some of its facilities, Spectrum Brands does not expect that such projects, taking into account established accruals, will cause Spectrum Brands to incur expenditures that are material to its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that Spectrum Brands’ future liability could be material.
Spectrum Brands has been, and in the future may be, subject to proceedings related to its disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off-site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which Spectrum Brands is held responsible as a result of its relationships with such other parties. In the U.S., these proceedings are under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) or similar state laws that hold persons who “arranged for” the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal. Liability under CERCLA is typically joint and several, meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site. As a practical matter, liability at CERCLA sites is shared by all of the viable responsible parties. Spectrum Brands occasionally is identified by federal or state governmental agencies as being a potentially responsible party for response actions contemplated at an off-site facility. At the existing sites where Spectrum Brands has been notified of its status as a potentially responsible party, it is either premature to determine whether its potential liability, if any, will be material or Spectrum Brands does not believe that its liability, if any, will be material. Spectrum Brands may be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state laws for other sites not currently known to it, and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may be material.
It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for environmental matters, particularly remediation, and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. See Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on estimated liabilities arising from such environmental matters. Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, Spectrum Brands believes that its ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters should not be material to its business or financial condition. 
Electronic and electrical products that Spectrum Brands sells in Europe, particularly products sold under the Remington® brand name, VARTA® battery chargers, certain portable lighting and all of Spectrum Brands’ batteries, are subject to regulation in European Union (“EU”) markets under three key EU directives. The first directive is the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) which took effect in EU member states beginning July 1, 2006. 
13

RoHS prohibits companies from selling products which contain certain specified hazardous materials in EU member states. Spectrum Brands believes that compliance with RoHS does not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. The second directive is entitled the Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”). WEEE makes producers or importers of particular classes of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. WEEE assigns levels of responsibility to companies doing business in EU markets based on their relative market share. WEEE calls on each EU member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. To comply with WEEE requirements, Spectrum Brands has partnered with other companies to create a comprehensive collection, treatment, disposal and recycling program. As EU member states pass enabling legislation Spectrum Brands currently expects its compliance system to be sufficient to meet such requirements. Spectrum Brands’ current estimated costs associated with compliance with WEEE are not significant based on its current market share. However, Spectrum Brands continues to evaluate the impact of the WEEE legislation and implementation of regulations as EU member states implement guidance and as its market share changes and, as a result, actual costs to Spectrum Brands could differ from its current estimates and may be material to its business, financial condition or results of operations. The third directive is the Directive on Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries, which was adopted in September 2006 and went into effect in September 2008 (the “Battery Directive”). The Battery Directive bans heavy metals in batteries by establishing maximum quantities of those heavy metals in batteries and mandates waste management of batteries, including collection, recycling and disposal systems. The Battery Directive places the costs of such waste management systems on producers and importers of batteries. The Battery Directive calls on each EU member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. Spectrum Brands currently believes that compliance with the Battery Directive does not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. EU member states have adopted enabling legislation required by the directive and issued additional guidance. Spectrum Brands will continue to evaluate the impact of the Battery Directive and its enabling legislation.
Certain of Spectrum Brands’ products and facilities in each of its business segments are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) or other federal consumer protection and product safety agencies and are subject to the regulations such agencies enforce, as well as by similar state, foreign and multinational agencies and regulations. For example, in the U.S., all products containing pesticides must be registered with the EPA and, in many cases, similar state and foreign agencies before they can be manufactured or sold. Spectrum Brands’ inability to obtain, delay in receipt or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether its competitors were similarly affected. Spectrum Brands attempts to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute chemicals and other ingredients. Spectrum Brands may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks.
The Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”) established a standard for food-use pesticides, which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under the FQPA, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative effects from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in certain of Spectrum Brands’ products continue to be evaluated by the EPA as part of this program. It is possible that the EPA or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide Spectrum Brands uses in its products will be limited or made unavailable to Spectrum Brands. Spectrum Brands cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPA’s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in its products.
Certain of Spectrum Brands’ products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the FDA. Among other things, the FDA enforces statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establishes ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, establishes standards of identity for certain products, determines the safety of products and establishes labeling standards and requirements. In addition, various states regulate these products by enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected products, grading products, inspecting production facilities and imposing their own labeling requirements.
Certain A/C products containing R-134a are subject to regulation in the U.S. markets under the EPA’s Significant New Alternative Policy (“SNAP Program”), which implements international agreements restricting the use of certain refrigerants. The EPA has identified use of R-134a in new automotive air conditioning systems as an approved use up to the 2020 automotive model year. The EPA has not yet approved a replacement refrigerant under the SNAP program for sale in small cans for automotive use for automobiles produced beginning with the 2021 model year, and future rulemakings from the agency are anticipated. In addition, in 2017 the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision that may remove R-134a from regulation under the SNAP program, and that decision may be subject to en banc review or a writ of certiorari filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. Spectrum Brands currently believes that compliance with current and future SNAP regulations will not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, financial condition, earnings or competitive position. However, until such time as future regulations are issued and future alternate refrigerants are approved for sale in small cans, a full evaluation of these costs cannot be completed by Spectrum Brands. Spectrum Brands will continue to evaluate the impact of the SNAP Program as the EPA issues additional guidance.
The fish sold under the GloFish brand can be classified as an intragenic or transgenic species due to the addition of their bioluminescent genes, which means the FDA has the authority to regulate as the luminescence is caused by intentionally altered 
14

genomic DNA. Additional regulatory agencies, including the EPA, as well as agencies in U.S. and foreign states have authority to regulate these types of species. It is possible that the EPA, FDA, or another U.S. or foreign state or federal agency could in the future seek to exercise authority over the distribution and/or sale of GloFish. Spectrum Brands will continue to monitor the development of any regulations that might apply to Spectrum Brands’ bioluminescent fish. 
Certain of Spectrum Brands’ products may be regulated under programs within the United States, Canada, or in other countries that may require that those products and the associated product packaging be recycled or managed for disposal through a designated recycling program. Some programs are funded through assessment of a fee on the manufacturer and suppliers, including Spectrum Brands. Spectrum Brands does not expect that such programs will cause Spectrum Brands to incur expenditures that are material to Spectrum Brands’ business, financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that Spectrum Brands’ future liability could be material.
The United States Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) was amended in 2016, and the EPA is currently evaluating additional chemicals for regulation under that amended law. Certain of Spectrum Brands’ products may be manufactured using chemicals or other ingredients that may be subject to regulation under current TSCA regulations, and other chemicals or ingredients may be regulated under the law in the future. Spectrum Brands does not expect that compliance with current or future TSCA regulations will cause Spectrum Brands to incur expenditures that are material to Spectrum Brands’ business, financial condition or results of operations; however, it is possible that Spectrum Brands’ future liability could be material.
Employees
Spectrum Brands had approximately 16,800 full-time employees worldwide as of September 30, 2017. Approximately 14% of its total labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. There are 8 collective bargaining agreements that will expire during Spectrum Brands’ Fiscal 2018, which cover approximately 74% of the labor force under collective bargaining agreements, or approximately 10% of its total labor force. Spectrum Brands believes that its overall relationship with its employees is good.

FGL
The FGL Business
FGL, a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of HRG, is a provider of various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products in the U.S. Based in Des Moines, Iowa, and Baltimore, Maryland, FGL operates its annuity and life insurance operations in the U.S. through its subsidiaries FGH, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company (“FGL Insurance”) and Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York (“FGL NY Insurance”). As of September 30, 2017, FGL had approximately 700,000 policyholders counting on the safety and protection features of FGL’s fixed annuity and life insurance products.
FGL offers various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Fixed annuities represent a retirement and savings tool which FGL’s customers rely on for principal protection and predictable income streams. In addition, FGL’s life insurance products provide its customers with a complementary product that allows them to build on their savings and assign payment of a death benefit to a designated beneficiary upon the policyholder’s death. Currently, FGL’s most popular products are fixed indexed annuities (“FIAs”) that tie contractual returns to specific market indices, such as the Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (“S&P”) 500 Index. In addition to FIAs, FGL also sells indexed universal life policies (“IULs”) and other fixed annuities. 
In Fiscal 2017, FIAs generated approximately 72% of FGL’s total sales and the remaining 28% of sales was primarily generated from fixed annuity sales during the year. FGL invests the annuity premiums primarily in fixed income securities and options and hedge FGL’s risk, predominantly using call options on the S&P 500 Index, and replicate the market index returns to its policyholders. The majority of FGL’s products contain provisions that permit FGL to annually adjust the formula by which index 
15

credits are provided in response to changing market conditions. In addition, FGL’s annuity contracts generally either cannot be surrendered or include surrender charges that discourage early redemptions.
The FGL Merger 
On November 8, 2015, Anbang Insurance Group Co., Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Anbang”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Anbang/FGL Merger Agreement”) to acquire FGL for $26.80 per share. On April 17, 2017, FGL terminated the Anbang/FGL Merger Agreement. Prior to its termination, the Anbang/FGL Merger Agreement was amended on November 3, 2016 and on February 9, 2017, each time to extend the outside termination date. As a result of the termination of the Anbang/FGL Merger Agreement, FGL had no remaining obligations thereunder.
On May 24, 2017, FGL entered into the FGL Merger Agreement with CF Corp and certain affiliates of CF Corp. Pursuant to the FGL Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the FGL Merger (the “Effective Time”), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of FGL (the “FGL Common Stock”) will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $31.10 in cash, without interest (the “FGL Merger Consideration”), other than any shares of FGL Common Stock owned by FGL as treasury stock or otherwise or owned by CF Corp, CF/FGL US or Merger Sub (which will be cancelled and no payment will be made with respect thereto), shares of FGL Common Stock granted pursuant to FGL’s Equity Plan (as defined in the FGL Merger Agreement) and those shares of FGL Common Stock with respect to which appraisal rights under Delaware law are properly exercised and not withdrawn. The FGL Merger Agreement permits FGL to pay out a regular quarterly cash dividend on its FGL Common Stock prior to the closing of the transaction in an amount not in excess of $0.065 per share, per quarter (the per share amount of FGL’s most recently declared quarterly dividend).
At the Effective Time, each (i) option to purchase shares of FGL Common Stock (a “FGL Stock Option”), (ii) restricted share of FGL Common Stock and (iii) performance-based restricted stock unit relating to shares of FGL Common Stock (an “RSU”), in each case whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares subject to the award (for RSUs, determined at the target performance level) multiplied by (2) the FGL Merger Consideration (less the exercise price per share in the case of FGL Stock Options). In addition, at the Effective Time, each stock option (“FGH Stock Option”) and restricted stock unit relating to shares of FGH, whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of FGH stock subject to the award multiplied by (B) $176.32 (less the exercise price in the case of such FGH Stock Options), and each dividend equivalent held in respect of a share of FGH stock (a “DER”), whether vested or unvested, will become fully vested and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the amount accrued with respect to such DER.
Following execution of the FGL Merger Agreement, FS Holdco II Ltd. (“FS Holdco”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HRG that holds a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of FGL Common Stock, executed and delivered to FGL a written consent (the “Consent”), approving and adopting the FGL Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the FGL Merger. As a result of the execution and delivery of the Consent, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of FGL’s Common Stock have adopted and approved the FGL Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the FGL Merger Agreement, the consummation of the FGL Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following closing conditions, which have been satisfied: (i) on June 16, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) on August 8, 2017, CF Corp held an extraordinary general meeting in lieu of an annual general meeting of shareholders, at which CF Corp’s shareholders approved, among other items, all of the proposals relating to the FGL Merger Agreement and the FGL Merger; (iii) on August 14, 2017, FGL filed with the SEC and mailed to its stockholders a definitive information statement in connection with the FGL Merger; (iv) on August 24, 2017, the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation granted its required regulatory approval relating to the FGL Merger; and (v) on November 8, 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services granted its required regulatory approval relating to the FGL Merger. In addition, the consummation of the FGL Merger is also subject to satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from the Iowa Insurance Division (“IID”) and the absence of any law or order enacted, issued or enforced that is in effect and that prevents or prohibits the consummation of the FGL Merger. With respect to the regulatory approvals from the IID, on November 7, 2017, the IID held a public hearing to consider whether the proposed acquisition of control of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company complies with the standards set forth under applicable Iowa insurance laws.
FGL expects to be in a position to close the FGL Merger before the end of calendar year 2017; however, the closing of the FGL Merger and the timing thereof is subject to the IID’s regulatory review and approval process, the results of which cannot be assured. In the event the FGL Merger Agreement is terminated, under certain circumstances, FGL may be required to pay a termination fee to CF Corp in an aggregate amount of $50.0 million.
The foregoing description of the FGL Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and should be read concurrently with the other related disclosure in this report, and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the FGL Merger Agreement filed by FGL with the SEC. FGL has filed with the SEC and mailed to its stockholders the definitive information statement. The definitive information statement and other relevant materials contain important information about FGL, CF Corp, the FGL Merger and related matters. These documents are available at no 
16

charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, documents are also available for free from FGL by contacting FGL’s investor relations department at Investor.Relations@fglife.com.
Strategy
FGL seeks to grow its business by pursuing a set of strategies aimed at delivering sustainable and profitable growth. These strategies include: (i) taking action to protect sales in FGL’s existing markets, strengthen its business and providing a platform for sustainable growth, (ii) building off FGL’s foundational initiatives and creating a more engaging, customer-focused experience, (iii) leveraging FGL’s product capabilities for additional distribution, and (iv) focusing on initiatives that FGL expects will deliver target profits.
Competition
FGL’s ability to compete is dependent upon many factors which include, among other things, its ability to develop competitive and profitable products, its ability to maintain stable relationships with its contracted IMOs, its ability to maintain low unit costs and its maintenance of adequate financial strength ratings from rating agencies. Principal competitive factors for FIAs are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, cost, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of FGL’s products and services. Principal competitive factors for IULs are based on service and distribution channel relationships, price, brand recognition, financial strength ratings of its insurance subsidiaries and financial stability. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Products
FGL’s experience designing and developing annuities and life insurance products is expected to allow FGL to continue to introduce innovative products and solutions designed to meet customers’ changing needs. FGL works hand-in-hand with its distributors to devise the most suitable product solutions for the ever-changing market. FGL believes that, on a practical basis, FGL has a unique understanding of the safety, accumulation, protection, and income needs of middle-income Americans.
Annuity Products
Through FGL’s insurance subsidiaries, FGL issues a portfolio of deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities. A deferred annuity is a type of contract that accumulates value on a tax deferred basis and typically begins making specified periodic or lump sum payments a certain number of years after the contract has been issued. An immediate annuity is a type of contract that begins making specified payments within one annuity period (e.g., one month or one year) and typically pays principal and earnings in equal payments over some period of time.
Deferred Annuities
FIAs
FGL’s FIAs allow contract owners the possibility of earning interest based on the performance of a specified market index, predominantly the S&P 500 Index, without risk to principal. The contracts include a provision for a minimum guaranteed surrender value calculated in accordance with applicable law. A market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks representing a particular segment of the market, or in some cases an entire market. For example, the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index is an index of 500 stocks intended to be representative of a broad segment of the market. All FIA products allow policyholders to allocate funds once a year among several different crediting strategies, including one or more index-based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy. High surrender charges apply for early withdrawal, typically seven to fourteen years after purchase.
The value to the contractholder of an FIA contract is equal to the sum of deposits paid, premium bonuses (described below), index credits, up to a cap and a participation rate based on the annual appreciation (based in certain situations on annual point-to-point, monthly point-to-point or monthly average calculations) in a recognized market index less any fees for riders. The cap can be reset annually. Certain riders allow for a contractholder to increase their cap for a set fee. As this fee is fixed, the contractholder may lose principal if the index credits received do not exceed the amount of such fee.
Fixed Rate Annuities
Fixed rate annuities include annual reset and multi-year rate guaranteed policies. Fixed rate annual reset annuities issued by FGL have an annual interest rate (the “crediting rate”) that is guaranteed for the first policy year. After the first policy year, FGL has the discretionary ability to change the crediting rate once annually to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. Fixed rate multi-year guaranteed annuities (“MYGAs”) are similar to fixed rate annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years before it may be changed at its discretion. 
Withdrawal Options for Deferred Annuities
After the first year following the issuance of a FIA deferred annuity policy, holders of deferred annuities are typically permitted penalty-free withdrawals up to 10% of the prior year’s value, subject to certain limitations. Withdrawals in excess of allowable 
17

penalty-free amounts are assessed a surrender charge if such withdrawals are made during the penalty period of the deferred annuity policy. The penalty period typically ranges from seven to fourteen years for FIAs and three to ten years for fixed rate annuities. 
The policyholder may elect to take the proceeds of the surrender either in a single payment or in a series of payments over the life of the policyholder or for a fixed number of years (or a combination of these payment options). In addition to the foregoing withdrawal rights, policyholders may also elect to have additional withdrawal rights by purchasing a GMWB. These riders provide a GMWB, regardless of index performance, for the life of the contract. However, the benefit may vary based on performance.
Immediate Annuities
FGL also sells single premium immediate annuities (or “SPIAs”), which provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder, according to the policyholder’s choice at the time of issue. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years.
Life Insurance
FGL currently offers IUL insurance policies and has previously sold term and whole life insurance products. Holders of universal life insurance policies earn returns on their policies which are credited to the policyholder’s cash value account. The insurer periodically deducts its expenses and the cost of life insurance protection from the cash value account. The balance of the cash value account is credited interest at a fixed rate or returns based on the performance of a market index, or both, at the option of the policyholder, using a method similar to that described above for FIAs.
Almost all of the life insurance policies in force, except for the return of premium benefits on term life insurance products, are subject to an arrangement with Wilton Reassurance Company (“Wilton Re”).
Distribution
The sale of FGL’s products typically occurs as part of a four-party, three stage sales process between FGL Insurance, an IMO, the agent and the customer. FGL Insurance designs, manufactures, issues, and services the product. The IMOs will usually sign contracts with multiple insurance carriers to provide their agents with a broad and competitive product portfolio. The IMO will discuss product options over the phone with agents about to meet with clients. The IMO staff will also provide assistance to the agent during the selling and application process. The agent may get customer leads from the IMOs. The agent will conduct a fact find and present suitable product choices to the customers. FGL monitors each distribution partner for pricing metrics, mortality, and persistency, as well as market conduct and suitability.
Within this business model, FGL offers its products through a network of approximately 200 IMOs, representing approximately 37,000 agents, and identifies its most important IMOs, those who FGL believes have the ability to generate significant production for FGL, as “Power Partners.” FGL currently has 32 Power Partners, comprised of 21 annuity IMOs and 11 life insurance IMOs. During Fiscal 2017, these Power Partners accounted for approximately 95.0% of its annual sales volume. FGL believes that its relationships with these IMOs are strong. The average tenure of the top ten Power Partners is approximately 14 years. 
FGL’s Power Partners play an important role in the development of its products. Over the last ten years, the majority of FGL’s best-selling products have been developed with its Power Partners. FGL intends to continue to have the Power Partners play an important role in the development of its products in the future, which FGL believes provides it with integral feedback throughout the development process and assists FGL with competing for “shelf space” of new design launches.
The top five states for the distribution of FGL Insurance products in 2017 were California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Michigan, which together accounted for nearly 42.9% of FGL Insurance’s premiums. 
Investments
FGL embraces a long-term conservative investment philosophy, investing nearly all the insurance premiums FGL receives in a wide range of fixed income interest-bearing securities.
FGL’s internal asset management team manages the bulk of the investment portfolio. For certain asset classes, FGL utilizes experienced third party companies, including FGL’s affiliates. FGL’s investment strategy is designed to (i) achieve strong absolute returns; (ii) provide consistent yield and investment income; and (iii) preserve capital.
In addition to active management of assets, FGL’s Investments department is also responsible for defining portfolio strategy, managing its asset/liability profile and hedging its product guarantees. 
The types of assets in which FGL may invest are influenced by various state laws, which prescribe qualified investment assets applicable to insurance companies. Additionally, FGL defines risk tolerance across a wide range of factors, including credit risk, liquidity risk, concentration (issuer and sector) risk, and caps on specific asset classes, which in turn establish conservative risk thresholds.
FGL’s investment portfolio consists of high quality fixed maturities, including publicly issued and privately issued corporate bonds, municipal and other government bonds, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), residential mortgage-backed securities 
18

(“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and commercial mortgage loans (“CMLs”). FGL also maintains holdings in floating rate, and less rate-sensitive investments, including senior tranches of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), non-agency RMBS, and various types of ABS. It is FGL’s expectation that its investment portfolio will broaden in scope and diversity to include other asset classes held by life and annuity insurance writers. FGL also has a small amount of equity holdings through its funding arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta.
Portfolio Activity
Over the last year, FGL continued to work with its internal asset management team and third party asset managers to broaden the portfolio’s exposure to include United States dollar (“USD”) denominated emerging market bonds, highly rated preferred stocks and hybrids and structured securities including ABS. 
Derivatives
FGL’s FIA contracts permit the holder to elect to receive a return based on an interest rate or the performance of a market index, most typically based on the S&P 500 Index. FGL purchases derivatives consisting predominantly of call options and, to a lesser degree, futures contracts on the equity indices underlying the applicable policy. These derivatives are used to fund the index credits due to policyholders under the FIA contracts based upon policyholders’ contract elections. The majority of all such call options are one-year options purchased to match the funding requirements underlying the FIA contracts. On the anniversary dates of the FIA contracts, the market index used to compute the annual index credit under the FIA contract is reset. At such time, FGL purchases new one-, two-, three-, or five-year call options to fund the next index credit. FGL attempts to manage the cost of these purchases through the terms of its FIA contracts, which permit FGL to change caps or participation rates, subject to certain guaranteed minimums that must be maintained. The change in the fair value of the call options and futures contracts is generally designed to offset the equity market related change in the fair value of the FIA contract’s related reserve liability. The call options and futures contracts are marked to fair value with the change in fair value included as a component of Net investment gains (losses). The change in fair value of the call options and futures contracts includes the gains and losses recognized at the expiration of the instruments’ terms or upon early termination and the changes in fair value of open positions.
Outsourcing
FGL outsources the following functions to third-party service providers:

• | new business administration (data entry and policy issue only);


• | service of existing policies;


• | underwriting administration of life insurance applications;


• | call centers;


• | information technology development and maintenance;


• | investment accounting and custody; and


• | hosting of financial systems.

FGL closely manages its outsourcing partners and integrates their services into its operations. FGL believes that outsourcing such functions allows it to focus capital and FGL employees on its core business operations and perform differentiating functions, such as investment, actuarial, product development and risk management functions. In addition, FGL believes an outsourcing model provides predictable pricing, service levels and volume capabilities and allows it to benefit from technological developments that enhance its customer self-service and sales processes.
Ratings
FGL’s access to funding and its related cost of borrowing, the attractiveness of certain of its products to customers and requirements for derivatives collateral posting are affected by FGL’s credit ratings and insurance financial strength ratings, which are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies. Financial strength ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products.
As of September 30, 2017, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) issued financial strength credit and/or ratings and outlook statements regarding FGH and its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries, FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations under an insurance policy and generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company’s financial condition and operating performance. Generally, rating agencies base their financial strength ratings upon information furnished to them by the insurer and upon their own investigations, studies and assumptions. Financial strength ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Credit and financial strength ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 
19

In addition to the financial strength ratings, rating agencies use an “outlook statement” to indicate a medium or long term trend which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A positive outlook indicates a rating may be raised and a negative outlook indicates a rating may be lowered. A stable outlook is assigned when ratings are not likely to be changed. A developing outlook is assigned when a rating may be raised, lowered, or affirmed. Outlooks should not be confused with expected stability of the issuer’s financial or economic performance. A rating may have a “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change, but a “stable” outlook does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice.
Following the announcement of the proposed FGL Merger, the rating organizations have undertaken a review of FGL’s debt ratings and FGL’s insurance company subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings. The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative. Such actions are beyond FGL’s control and FGL cannot predict what these actions may be and the timing thereof.
A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P review their ratings of insurance companies from time to time. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be changed or withdrawn entirely if, in their judgment, circumstances so warrant. While the degree to which ratings adjustments will affect sales and persistency is unknown, FGL believes if its ratings were to be negatively adjusted for any reason, FGL could experience a material decline in the sales of its products and the persistency of its existing business. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to FGL’s and Front Street’s Businesses.”
Potential Impact of a Ratings Downgrade
Under some of its International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) agreements, FGL has agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels provides the counterparty under the agreement the right to terminate the open derivative contracts between the parties, at which time any amounts payable by FGL or the counterparty would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. FGL’s current rating allows multiple counterparties the right to terminate the ISDA agreements, at which time the counterparty would unwind existing positions for fair market value. No ISDA agreements have been terminated, although the counterparties have reserved the right to terminate ISDA agreements at any time. As of September 30, 2017, the amount due to FGL at risk for the ISDA agreements which could be terminated based upon its current ratings was $412.8 million, which equals the fair value to FGL of the open over-the-counter call option positions. The fair value of the call options can never decrease below zero. See Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk-FGL.” 
In certain transactions, FGL and its counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement requiring either party to post collateral when the net exposures exceed predetermined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating, however are generally zero. As of September 30, 2017 and 2016, $381.2 million and $127.8 million, respectively, of collateral was posted by FGL’s counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that FGL would incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $31.6 million and $147.4 million at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
If FGL’s insurance subsidiaries held net short positions against a counterparty, and such subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings were below the levels required in ISDA agreement with the counterparty, the counterparty would demand immediate further collateralization which could negatively impact overall liquidity. Based on the market value of FGL’s derivatives as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, FGL holds no net short positions against a counterparty; therefore, there is currently no potential exposure for FGL to post collateral. 
A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of FGL’s principal insurance subsidiaries could affect its competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for FGL to market its products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. A downgrade of the financial strength rating could also impact FGL’s borrowing costs.
Risk Management
Risk management is a critical part of FGL’s business. FGL seeks to assess risk to its business through a formalized process involving (i) identifying short-term and long-term strategic and operational objectives, (ii) development of risk appetite statements that establish what the company is willing to accept in terms of risks to achieving its goals and objectives, (iii) identifying the levers that control the risk appetite of the company, (iv) establishing the overall limits of risk acceptable for a given risk driver, (v) establishing operational risk limits that are aligned with the tolerances, (vi) assigning risk limit quantification and mitigation responsibilities to individual team members within functional groups, (vii) analyzing the potential qualitative and quantitative impact of individual risks, including but not limited to stress and scenario testing covering over 8 economic and insurance related risks, (viii) mitigating risks by appropriate actions and (ix) identifying, documenting and communicating key business risks in a timely fashion.
The responsibility for monitoring, evaluating and responding to risk is assigned first to FGL’s management and employees, second to those occupying specialist functions, such as legal compliance and risk teams, and third to those occupying supervisory functions, such as internal audit and the board of directors.
20

 Reinsurance
FGL both cedes reinsurance and assumes reinsurance from other insurance companies. FGL uses reinsurance to diversify risks, manage loss exposures to enhance FGL’s capital position, and to manage new business volume.
In instances where FGL is the ceding company, FGL pays a premium to a reinsurer in exchange for the reinsurer assuming a portion of FGL’s liabilities under the policies it issued and collecting expense allowances in return for FGL’s administration of the ceded policies. Use of reinsurance does not discharge FGL’s liability as the ceding company because FGL remains directly liable to its policyholders and is required to pay the full amount of FGL’s policy obligations in the event that FGL’s reinsurers fail to satisfy their obligations. FGL collects reimbursement from its reinsurers when FGL pays claims on policies that are reinsured. In instances where FGL assumes reinsurance from another insurance company, FGL accepts, in exchange for a reinsurance premium, a portion of the liabilities of the other insurance company under the policies that the ceding company has issued to its policyholders.
FGL monitors the credit risk related to the ability of its reinsurers to honor their obligations under various agreements. To minimize the risk of credit loss on such contracts, FGL generally diversifies its exposures among many reinsurers and limits the amount of exposure to each based on financial strength ratings. FGL is able to further manage risk via funds withheld arrangements.
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors- Risks Related to FGL’s and Front Street’s Businesses” for further discussion of reinsurance credit risk.
As of the date of this report, FGL had a number of reinsurance agreements, including agreements with Wilton Re, Front Street, Hannover Re and Raven Reinsurance Company. See Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Credit Risk-FGL”.
Regulation
Overview
FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision in their domiciles, Iowa, New York and Vermont, respectively, and in each state in which they do business. FGL Insurance does business throughout the United States, except for New York. FGL NY Insurance only does business in New York. Raven Re is a special purpose captive reinsurance company that only provides reinsurance to FGL Insurance under the Raven Reinsurance Agreement. Following its re-domestication to Iowa, FGL Insurance’s principal insurance regulatory authority is the IID. State insurance departments throughout the United States also monitor FGL Insurance’s insurance operations as a licensed insurer. The NYDFS regulates the operations of FGL NY Insurance, which is domiciled and licensed in New York. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect policyholders and beneficiaries and not general creditors and shareholders of those insurers. Many of the laws and regulations to which FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject are regularly re-examined and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect their operations.
Generally, insurance products underwritten by and rates used by FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance must be approved by the insurance regulators in each state in which they are sold. Those products are also substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. For example, changes in tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the deposits paid by the holders of annuities and life insurance products, which could make such products less attractive to potential purchasers. A shift away from life insurance and annuity products could reduce FGL Insurance’s and FGL NY Insurance’s income from the sale of such products, as well as the assets upon which FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance earn investment income. In addition, insurance products may also be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”).
State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including:

• | licensing to transact business;


• | licensing agents;


• | prescribing which assets and liabilities are to be considered in determining statutory surplus;


• | regulating premium rates for certain insurance products;


• | approving policy forms and certain related materials;


• | determining whether a reasonable basis exists as to the suitability of the annuity purchase recommendations producers make;


• | regulating unfair trade and claims practices;


• | establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards;


• | regulating the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year;


• | regulating the availability of reinsurance or other substitute financing solutions, the terms thereof and the ability of an insurer to take credit on its financial statements for insurance ceded to reinsurers or other substitute financing solutions;


• | fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; and

21


• | regulating the type, amounts, and valuations of investments permitted, transactions with affiliates, and other matters.

Financial Regulation
State insurance laws and regulations require FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re to file reports, including financial statements, with state insurance departments in each state in which they do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has approved a series of statutory accounting principles and various model regulations that have been adopted, in some cases with certain modifications, by all state insurance departments. These statutory principles are subject to ongoing change and modification. For instance, the NAIC adopted, effective with the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2010, revisions to the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation (or the Model Audit Rule) related to auditor independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. These revisions require that insurance companies, such as FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, file reports with state insurance departments regarding their assessments of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, compliance with any particular regulator’s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator’s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. Any particular regulator’s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may change over time to FGL Insurance’s or FGL NY Insurance’s detriment, or changes to the overall legal or market environment, even absent any change of interpretation by a particular regulator, may cause FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance to change their views regarding the actions they need to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to FGL Insurance’s or FGL NY Insurance’s practices that may, in some cases, limit their ability to grow and improve profitability.
State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy and rate filings, market conduct and business practices of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. State insurance departments also have the authority to conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are licensed in their states. The Maryland Insurance Administration (“MIA”) completed a routine financial examination of FGL Insurance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, and found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. The NYDFS completed a routine financial examination of FGL NY for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed. The NYDFS is in the process of completing a routine financial examination of FGL NY Insurance for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2012. 
The Vermont Department of Financial Regulation has completed a routine financial examination of Raven Re for the period from April 7, 2011 (commencement of business) through December 31, 2012. It found no material deficiencies and proposed no adjustments to the financial statements as filed.
Going forward, FGL Insurance will be subject to financial and market conduct examinations by the IID, the primary regulatory authority for Iowa domestic life insurance companies.
Dividend and Other Distribution Payment Limitations
The Iowa insurance law and the New York insurance law regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year by FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, respectively. Each year, FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance may pay a certain limited amount of ordinary dividends or other distributions without being required to obtain the prior consent of the Iowa Insurance Commissioner (“Iowa Commissioner”) or the NYDFS, respectively. However, to pay any dividends or distributions (including the payment of any dividends or distributions for which prior consent is not required), FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance must provide advance written notice to the Iowa Commissioner or the NYDFS, respectively.
Pursuant to Iowa insurance law, ordinary dividends are payments, together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months, that do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of FGL Insurance’s statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (ii) the net gain from operations of FGL Insurance (excluding realized capital gains) for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year.
Dividends in excess of FGL Insurance’s ordinary dividend capacity are referred to as extraordinary and require prior approval of the Iowa Commissioner. In deciding whether to approve a request to pay an extraordinary dividend, Iowa insurance law requires the Iowa Commissioner to consider the effect of the dividend payment on FGL Insurance’s surplus and financial condition generally and whether the payment of the dividend will cause FGL Insurance to fail to meet its required risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratio. Dividends may only be paid out of statutory earned surplus.
Any payment of dividends by FGL Insurance is subject to the regulatory restrictions described above and the approval of such payment by the board of directors of FGL Insurance, which must consider various factors, including general economic and business conditions, tax considerations, FGL Insurance’s strategic plans, financial results and condition, FGL Insurance’s expansion plans, any contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends and its effect on RBC and such other factors the board of directors of FGL Insurance considers relevant. For example, payments of dividends could reduce FGL 
22

Insurance’s RBC and financial condition and lead to a reduction in FGL Insurance’s financial strength rating. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to FGL’s and Front Street’s Businesses-A financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency, could make FGL’s product offerings less attractive and increase its cost of capital, and thereby adversely affect FGL’s financial condition and results of operations.”
FGL NY Insurance has historically not paid dividends. In 2012, FGL NY Insurance paid a $4.4 million dividend to FGL Insurance after a determination that, as a result of capital contributions by FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance was overcapitalized. 
 Surplus and Capital
FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject to the supervision of the regulators in states where they are licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary authority in connection with the continuing licensing of these entities to limit or prohibit sales to policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such entities have not maintained the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders.
Risk-Based Capital
In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement RBC requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially similar law. RBC is used to evaluate the adequacy of capital and surplus maintained by an insurance company in relation to risks associated with: (i) asset risk, (ii) insurance risk, (iii) interest rate risk, and (iv) business risk. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items, taking into account the risk characteristics of the insurer. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. The RBC formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. As of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the RBC ratios for FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance each exceeded the minimum RBC requirements.
It is desirable to maintain an RBC ratio in excess of the minimum requirements in order to maintain or improve FGL’s financial strength ratings. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to FGL’s and Front Street’s Businesses-A financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency, could make FGL’s product offerings less attractive and increase its cost of capital, and thereby could adversely affect FGL’s financial condition and results of operations.”
Insurance Regulatory Information System Tests
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. A ratio falling outside the prescribed “usual range” is not considered a failing result. Rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In many cases, it is not unusual for financially sound companies to have one or more ratios that fall outside the usual range. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges”. Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. IRIS consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review insurers’ annual statements and financial ratios. The statistical phase consists of 12 key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated from the NAIC database annually; each ratio has a “usual range” of results. As of December 31, 2016, FGL Insurance had one ratio outside the usual range, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re each had two ratios outside the usual range. The IRIS ratio for change in reserving for both FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance was outside the usual range.  The IRIS ratio for change in premium for both FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re was outside the usual range. In addition, Raven Re’s IRIS ratio for adequacy of investment income also fell outside the usual range.
In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required. FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re are not currently subject to regulatory restrictions based on these ratios.
Insurance Reserves
State insurance laws require insurers to analyze the adequacy of reserves. The respective appointed actuaries for FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re must each submit an opinion on an annual basis that their respective reserves, when considered in light of the respective assets FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for the contractual obligations and related expenses of FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re. FGL Insurance, FGL NY Insurance and Raven Re have filed all of the required opinions with the insurance departments in the states in which they do business.
23

Credit for Reinsurance Regulation
States regulate the extent to which insurers are permitted to take credit on their financial statements for the financial obligations that the insurers cede to reinsurers. Where an insurer cedes obligations to a reinsurer which is neither licensed nor accredited by the state insurance department, the ceding insurer is not permitted to take such financial statement credit unless the unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurer secures the liabilities it will owe under the reinsurance contract. Under the laws regulating credit for reinsurance issued by such unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers, the permissible means of securing such liabilities are (i) the establishment of a trust account by the reinsurer to hold certain qualifying assets in a qualified U.S. financial institution, such as a member of the Federal Reserve, with the ceding insurer as the exclusive beneficiary of such trust account with the unconditional right to demand, without notice to the reinsurer, that the trustee pay over to it the assets in the trust account equal to the liabilities owed by the reinsurer; (ii) the posting of an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit by a qualified U.S. financial institution in favor of the ceding company allowing the ceding company to draw upon the letter of credit up to the amount of the unpaid liabilities of the reinsurer and (iii) a “funds withheld” arrangement by which the ceding company withholds transfer to the reinsurer of the reserves which support the liabilities to be owed by the reinsurer, with the ceding insurer retaining title to and exclusive control over such reserves. In addition, on January 1, 2014, the NAIC Model Credit for Reinsurance Act became effective in Iowa, which adds the concept of “certified reinsurer”, whereby a ceding insurer may take financial statement credit for reinsurance provided by an unaccredited and unlicensed reinsurer which has been certified by the Iowa Commissioner. The Iowa Commissioner certifies reinsurers based on several factors, including their financial strength ratings, and imposes collateral requirements based on such factors. FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject to such credit for reinsurance rules in Iowa and New York, respectively, insofar as they enter into any reinsurance contracts with reinsurers which are neither licensed nor accredited in Iowa and New York, respectively.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
As the parent company of FGL Insurance and the indirect parent company of FGL NY Insurance, FGL and entities affiliated for purposes of insurance regulation are subject to the insurance holding company laws in Iowa and New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions between insurers and affiliates within the holding company system are subject to regulation and must be fair and reasonable, and may require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by its domiciliary insurance regulator.
Most states, including Iowa and New York, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Such laws prevent any person from acquiring control, directly or indirectly, of HRG, FGL, FGH, FGL Insurance or FGL NY Insurance unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. In addition, investors deemed to have a direct or indirect controlling interest are required to make regulatory filings and respond to regulatory inquiries. Under most states’ statutes, including those of Iowa and New York, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of HRG’s voting securities or that of HRG, FGL, FGH, FGL Insurance or FGL NY Insurance without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of Iowa and New York will be in violation of those states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. The requirement to obtain such insurance regulatory approval will no longer apply to the acquisition of HRG’s shares of common stock if HRG’s interest in FGL is disposed of pursuant to the FGL Merger.
Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. Although no prediction can be made as to the amount and timing of any future assessments under these laws, FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance have established reserves that they believe are adequate for assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
Market Conduct Regulation
State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales and complaint process practices. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. In addition, FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance must file, and in many jurisdictions and for some lines of business obtain regulatory approval for, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. FGL Insurance is currently the subject of four ongoing market conduct examinations in various states. Market conduct examinations can result in monetary fines or remediation and generally require FGL Insurance to devote significant resources to the management of 
24

such examinations. FGL Insurance does not believe that any of the current market conduct examinations it is subject to will result in any fines or remediation orders that will be material to its business.
Regulation of Investments
FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, equity, real estate, other equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as either non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus or as not qualified as an asset held for reserve purposes and, in some instances, would require divestiture or replacement of such non-qualifying investments. FGL believes that the investment portfolios of FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance as of September 30, 2017 complied in all material respects with such regulations. 
Privacy Regulation
FGL’s operations are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of such information. These laws and regulations require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement agencies, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal information to protect the security of the data. FGL’s operations are also subject to certain federal regulations that require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. In addition, FGL’s ability to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers and its uses of certain personal information, including consumer report information, are regulated. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information.
FIAs
In recent years, the SEC and state securities regulators have questioned whether FIAs, such as those sold by FGL, should be treated as securities under the federal and state securities laws rather than as insurance products exempted from such laws. Treatment of these products as securities would require additional registration and licensing of these products and the agents selling them, as well as cause FGL to seek additional marketing relationships for these products, any of which may impose significant restrictions on its ability to conduct operations as currently operated. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), annuities that meet specific requirements, including requirements relating to certain state suitability rules, are specifically exempted from being treated as securities by the SEC. FGL expects that the types of FIAs FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance sell will meet these requirements and therefore are exempt from being treated as securities by the SEC and state securities regulators. However, there can be no assurance that federal or state securities laws or state insurance laws and regulations will not be amended or interpreted to impose further requirements on FIAs.
The Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act makes sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are or may become applicable to FGL, its competitors or those entities with which FGL does business, including, but not limited to:

• | the establishment of federal regulatory authority over derivatives;


• | the establishment of consolidated federal regulation and resolution authority over systemically important financial services firms;


• | the establishment of the Federal Insurance Office;


• | changes to the regulation of broker dealers and investment advisors;


• | changes to the regulation of reinsurance;


• | changes to regulations affecting the rights of shareholders;


• | the imposition of additional regulation over credit rating agencies;


• | the imposition of concentration limits on financial institutions that restrict the amount of credit that may be extended to a single person or entity; and


• | the clearing of derivative contracts.

Numerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption of implementing rules or regulations, some of which have been implemented. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislation or regulation applicable to the insurance industry, FGL, its competitors or those entities with which FGL does business. Legislative or regulatory requirements imposed by or promulgated in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act may impact FGL in many ways, including, but not limited to:

• | placing FGL at a competitive disadvantage relative to FGL’s competition or other financial services entities;

25


• | changing the competitive landscape of the financial services sector or the insurance industry;


• | making it more expensive for FGL to conduct its business;


• | requiring the reallocation of significant company resources to government affairs;


• | increasing FGL’s legal and compliance related activities and the costs associated therewith; or


• | otherwise having a material adverse effect on the overall business climate as well as FGL’s financial condition and results of operations.

Until various studies are completed and final regulations are promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on investments, investment activities and insurance and annuity products of FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance remains unclear.
ERISA
FGL may offer certain insurance and annuity products to employee benefit plans governed by ERISA and/or the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), including group annuity contracts designated to fund tax-qualified retirement plans. ERISA and the Code provide (among other requirements) standards of conduct for employee benefit plan fiduciaries, including investment managers and investment advisers with respect to the assets of such plans, and holds fiduciaries liable if they fail to satisfy fiduciary standards of conduct. 
In April 2016, the Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued the “fiduciary” rule which could have a material impact on FGL, its products, distribution, and business model. The rule provides that persons who render investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to an employer plan or individual retirement account (“IRA”) are fiduciaries of that plan or IRA. The rule expands the definition of fiduciary under ERISA to apply to insurance agents who advise and sell products to IRA owners. As a result, commissioned insurance agents selling FGL’s IRA products must qualify for a prohibited transaction exemption, either the newly introduced Best Interest Contract Exemption (BICE) or amended PTE 84-24. When fully implemented, BICE would apply to fixed indexed annuities and amended PTE 84-24 would apply to fixed rate annuities. The rule and exemptions have been the subject of much controversy and various actions have been taken by DOL to delay and reconsider aspects of the rule and exemptions. The rule took effect June 2016 and was scheduled to become applicable in April 2017 but the “applicability date” was delayed by DOL for 60 days from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017. DOL also acted to delay many aspects of the prohibited transaction exemption requirements during a transition period from June 9, 2017 to January 1, 2018 provided the agent (and if applicable, financial institution) comply with “impartial conduct standards.” The impartial conduct standards essentially require the sale to be in the “best interest” of the client, misleading statements not be made, and compensation be reasonable. More recently, DOL has proposed extending the transition period to July 1, 2019 which at the present time is still under consideration. Industry continues its efforts to overturn the rule in court actions and Congress continues to consider related legislation but the success or failure of these efforts cannot be predicted. Assuming the rule is not overturned and the requirements of the exemptions were to be implemented fully, the impact on the financial services industry generally and on FGL and its business in particular is difficult to assess. FGL believes however it could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to IRA owners particularly in the independent agent distribution channel. A significant portion of FGL’s annuity sales are to IRAs. Compliance with the prohibited transaction exemptions when fully phased in would likely require additional supervision of agents, cause changes to compensation practices and product offerings, and increase litigation risk, all of which could adversely impact FGL’s business, results of operations and/or financial condition. FGL Insurance will continue to monitor developments closely and believes it is prepared to execute implementation plans as necessary to meet the rule and exemption requirements on the requisite applicability dates.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, FGL had approximately 299 employees. FGL believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.

Front Street
Front Street, a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of HRG, holds all of the equity of Front Street Re Ltd., a Bermuda company (“Front Street Bermuda”) and Front Street Cayman, an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and subsidiary of HRG. Front Street Bermuda was formed in March 2010 to act as a long-term reinsurer. Front Street Cayman was formed in the Cayman Islands and on October 24, 2012, received from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority a license to carry on business as an Unrestricted Class “B” Insurer that permits Front Street Cayman to conduct offshore direct and reinsurance business. Front Street Bermuda and Front Street Cayman are parties to reinsurance transactions. 
On December 31, 2012, following regulatory approval, FGL Insurance entered into a coinsurance agreement (the “Cayman Reinsurance Agreement”) with Front Street Cayman. Pursuant to the Cayman Reinsurance Agreement, Front Street Cayman reinsured a 10% quota share percentage of certain FGL Insurance annuity liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion and the funds withheld assets are $1 billion. Under the terms of the Cayman Reinsurance Agreement, Front Street Cayman paid an initial ceding allowance of $15.0 million which was determined to be fair and reasonable according to an independent third-party actuarial firm. The Cayman Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheld basis, meaning that funds are withheld by FGL Insurance from the coinsurance premium owed to Front Street Cayman as collateral for Front Street Cayman’s payment obligations. Accordingly, the collateral assets remain under the ultimate ownership of FGL Insurance. As of September 30, 2017, ceded reserves were $1.0 billion.
Effective September 17, 2014, FGL Insurance entered into a second reinsurance treaty with Front Street Cayman whereby FGL Insurance ceded 30% of any new business of its MYGA block of business on a funds withheld basis. This treaty was subsequently terminated as to new business effective April 30, 2015 but will remain in effect for policies ceded to Front Street Cayman with an effective date between September 17, 2014 and April 30, 2015.
On December 16, 2013, Front Street Cayman closed a reinsurance treaty with Bankers Life Insurance Company. Under the terms of the treaty, Bankers Life Insurance Company ceded annuity business to Front Street Cayman, on a funds withheld basis. On October 31, 2014, Front Street Cayman purchased Ability Re from Ability Re Holdings. The Ability Re acquisition consisted of long-term care reinsurance business. The acquired reinsurance agreements complement Front Street Cayman’s existing in force long-duration insurance liabilities. During Fiscal 2015, Front Street Cayman also closed three additional reinsurance transactions with unaffiliated parties. At September 30, 2017 and 2016, Front Street had $742.7 million and $671.6 million, respectively, of funds withheld receivables and $716.1 million and $631.8 million, respectively, of insurance reserves related to reinsurance transactions with third parties. 
On May 24, 2017, Front Street entered into the Front Street Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Front Street has agreed to sell to CF/FGL US all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Acquired Companies. The purchase price is $65.0 million, subject to customary adjustments for transaction expenses. The definitive documentation contains customary representations, warranties and indemnification obligations. In addition, at the closing of the Front Street Sale, $6.5 million of the purchase price will be deposited in escrow for a period of 15 months (as extended to satisfy pending claims at such time) to support certain indemnification obligations of Front Street to CF/FGL US. The required regulatory approvals in connection with the transaction have been received and the closing of the transaction is expected to take place before the end of calendar year 2017, subject to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including the consummation of the FGL Merger. The closing of the FGL Merger is not conditioned upon the closing of the Front Street Sale. Prior to the execution of the Front Street Purchase Agreement, the operations of Front Street were reported in the Company’s Insurance segment.
In addition, on May 24, 2017, HRG, FS Holdco II Ltd. (“FS Holdco”), CF Corp and CF/FGL US entered into an agreement (the “338 Agreement”) pursuant to which CF/FGL US agreed that FS Holdco may, at its option, cause CF/FGL US and FS Holdco to make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to the FGL Merger and the deemed share purchases of FGL’s subsidiaries (the “338 Tax Election”). Pursuant to the 338 Agreement, if FS Holdco elects to make the 338 Tax Election, it will be required to pay CF/FGL US $30.0 million, plus additional specified amounts, in excess of $6.0 million, determined by reference to FGL’s incremental current tax costs attributable to the 338 Tax Election, if any, and CF/FGL US will be required to pay FS Holdco additional specified amounts, in excess of $6.0 million, determined by reference to FGL’s incremental current tax savings attributable to the 338 Tax Election, if any. As of the date hereof, the Company expects to exercise the 338 Tax Election. As of September 30, 2017, HRG had approximately $1,840.2 million of gross U.S. net operating loss (“NOL”) and capital loss carryforwards - also see Part IV, Item 15. Note 18, Income Taxes to HRG’s Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. If the 338 Tax Election is made, HRG expects to retain such federal NOL and capital loss carryforwards following the sale of its stock in the FGL Merger. If the Company exercises the 338 Tax Election, at September 30, 2017, the Company estimated to receive a $9.6 million net payment from CF Corp to HRG, which was reflected in the estimated fair value, less cost to sell of FGL as of September 30, 2017. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the Company will receive the expected benefits of such election. In addition, the estimated payment described herein is preliminary and subject to change, and will not be definitively determined until the FGL Merger is closed and the 338 Tax Election is made and the parties to the 338 Agreement complete their review of the election in accordance with the terms of the 338 Agreement.

Strategy
Front Street was formed with the intention of building a flexible and diversified portfolio of life and annuity reinsurance treaties. Front Street may also conduct hedging and other investment activities. 
Competition
The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. Front Street competes with major reinsurers, most of which are well established and have significant operating histories, strong financial strength ratings and long-standing client relationships. Front Street’s competitors include Athene Life Re Ltd., Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited, Guggenheim Life and Annuity Company, Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated, Legal & General Reinsurance Company Ltd., and Resolution Life Holdings, Inc., as well as smaller companies and other niche reinsurers. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to FGL’s and Front Street’s Businesses- FGL and Front Street operate in highly competitive industries, which could limit their abilities to gain or maintain their respective positions in the industries and could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, Front Street had four employees, none of which were represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. Front Street believes that its overall relationship with its employees is good.
