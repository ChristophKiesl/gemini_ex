General 
We are a NYSE-listed hospitality and leisure company (ticker symbol: RLH) doing business as RLH Corporation and primarily engaged in the franchising and ownership of hotels under the following proprietary brands: Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotels, Red Lion Inn & Suites, GuestHouse, Settle Inn, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Signature and Signature Inn, Knights Inn, and Country Hearth Inns & Suites.
All our properties strive to highlight friendly service and reflect the local flair of their markets. The midscale RLH Corporation brands of Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotel and Red Lion Inn & Suites offer a unique local spin on the expected travel experience in an environment that allows customers to feel welcome and at home. Our focus is to anticipate guest needs and pleasantly surprise them with our distinctive Pacific Northwest-inspired customer service. Warm and authentic, our commitment to customer service includes a focus on delivering the guest locally inspired, friendly and personalized signature moments. This is intended to position each RLH Corporation brand hotel as an advocate to our traveling guests, creating brand relevance and loyalty, differentiating us from our competition.
Our economy brands are focused on delivering our guests a consistent experience with exceptional comfort, quality and service at an affordable rate, with approximately 1,000 locations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and two countries outside the United States.

A summary of our executed franchise agreements for the year ended December 31, 2019 is provided below:

In 2017, we announced that we would be marketing for sale 11 of our owned hotels held by our consolidated joint venture, RL Venture. This is consistent with the Company’s previously stated business strategy of moving towards operating as primarily a franchise company. During 2018, nine of the properties were sold. Using proceeds from the sale of the hotels and the release of restricted cash associated with the debt, RL Venture repaid the remaining principal balance outstanding under its loan agreement with Pacific Western Bank in July 2018. In December 2019, we sold an additional RL venture property, the Hotel RL Salt Lake City. Using proceeds from the sale, RL Venture repaid the remaining principal balance outstanding under its loan agreement secured by the Hotel RL Salt Lake City property with Umpqua Bank. As of December 31, 2019, there is one remaining owned hotel held by our consolidated joint venture, RL Venture.
In November 2019, we sold the Red Lion Hotel Atlanta Airport hotel, previously owned by our consolidated joint venture, RLS Atla Venture, LLC. Using the proceeds from the sale, RLH Atlanta LLC, which is wholly-owned by RLS Atla Venture, repaid the remaining principal balance outstanding under its loan agreement with PFP Holding Company IV LLC.
In May 2018, Red Lion Hotels Franchising, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of RLH Corporation (RLH Franchising) completed the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Knights Franchise Systems, Inc. (KFS), and the purchase of certain operating assets from, and assumption of certain liabilities relating to the business of franchising Knights Inn branded hotels to hotel owners from Wyndham Hotel Group Canada, ULC and Wyndham Hotel Group Europe Limited, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $27.2 million. 
Operations 
We operate in two reportable segments: 
•The franchised hotels segment is engaged primarily in licensing our brands to franchisees. This segment generates revenue from royalty, marketing, and other fees that are primarily based on a percentage of room revenue or on room count or on transaction count and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our marketing and central services programs. These central services and marketing programs include our reservation system, guest loyalty program, national and regional sales, revenue management tools, quality inspections, advertising and brand standards. Additionally, this segment includes our initial direct contracts for Canvas Integrated Systems, discussed further below.
•The company operated hotel segment derives revenues primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage offerings at owned and leased hotels for which we consolidate results. Revenues have also been derived from management fees and related charges for hotels with which we contract to perform management services, however our last management agreement terminated in February 2019.
Our remaining activities, none of which constitutes a reportable segment, have been aggregated into "other". 
We have two measures of segment performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP): revenue and operating income. 
Intersegment revenues are minimal. Certain operating expenses are allocated to the operating segments based upon internally established allocation methodologies. Income tax provision (benefit) and certain corporate operating expenses are neither allocated to the segments nor included in the measures of segment performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information about our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. 
Overview
Company Strategy 
Our strategy prioritizes getting "back to basics" with a renewed commitment to franchisees and a tactical focus on growth opportunities. We are focusing on what matters most to our franchisees: the evaluation and implementation of common sense brand standards which focus on return on investment for owners; amplifying marketing spend to increase brand contribution; targeted campaigns with input from franchisees; digital enhancements and expansion; and a commitment to development opportunities in markets that resonate with our brands. Corporate efforts will be rooted in R.O.A.R – Recruit, Onboard, Add value and Retain. We also plan to strategically expand our digital and targeted marketing program, primarily in local and regional markets, putting a larger focus on community engagement, franchisee revenue sources, and with the intent to increase contribution to owners. 
Our intention is to grow our brands and profitability by expanding our franchise hotel network with additional hotels. In 2019 we executed 169 franchise agreements. Also during 2019, 274 franchise agreements in our network terminated. 
By segmenting our midscale and economy brands with clear distinctions between each offering, we are uniquely positioned to provide an appealing alternative for a variety of owners. Our strategy for our midscale hotel brands is to identify larger urban metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that are saturated by larger brands in order to become the conversion brand of choice for owners of established hotels looking for alternatives in those markets. We believe our midscale brands have strong name recognition in the Western U.S. markets, providing us with an opportunity to expand our hotel network into markets across North America where our brands will be a unique and new value proposition for current and potential hotel owners in markets saturated by competitor brands. To assist in our ability to grow our hotel network in larger metropolitan cities, we may consider special incentives, minority equity, joint venture opportunities with hotel owners and investors, or adding additional brand options. Our economy hotel brands have strong national brand name recognition and provide hotel owners an affordable alternative to traditional franchise programs with primarily flat fees, sensible property improvement plans and a wealth of resources and programs to support owners. In addition to conversion from other brands, independently branded hotel operations may also benefit from the RLH Corporation central services programs. For all of our properties, we strive to provide hotel owners leading demand distribution technology and sales support as part of our brand support programs. 
Franchised Hotels
As of December 31, 2019 our network of hotels included 1,056 hotels under franchise agreements, representing approximately 66,700 rooms. We are growing our franchise network of hotels through execution of franchise agreements with hotel owners and through acquisitions of hotel brands and/or companies.
Also included is Canvas Integrated Systems, an all-in-one cloud-based hospitality management suite featuring a collection of seamlessly-integrated tools designed to drive revenue, secure more revenue opportunities, automate channel management and reduce cost and friction for independent hotel owners. Revenues from these agreements are included in Marketing, reservations and reimbursables revenue and associated expenses are included in Marketing, reservations, and reimbursables expense and Selling, general, administrative and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
In May 2018, we acquired the Knights Inn brand and related franchise agreements for approximately 330 hotels operating under the brand. See Note 16 for discussion of Acquisitions and Dispositions within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our focus on providing improved e-commerce revenue generation to our hotel owners includes investing in our rlhco.com website, enhanced and economical guest loyalty program, and improved and targeted digital marketing utilizing information generated through our RevPak reservation and distribution system.
We are also investing in technology and sales and marketing talent to improve our ability to manage the various channels that drive occupancy and average daily rate at our hotels, including transient, group and preferred corporate business. We continue to improve and implement our guest management ecosystem, RevPak, which includes a number of industry revenue generation systems fully integrated to provide comprehensive information on customer acquisition, customer management and customer retention. This suite of products is flexible and dynamic and can be tailored to the needs of individual hotel brands. It also delivers dynamic and personalized communications and promotions tailored to individual guest travel needs and habits.
Company Operated Hotels
Consistent with the Company's previously stated business strategy to move towards operating as primarily a franchise company, in 2017, we announced that we would be marketing for sale 11 of our owned hotels held by our consolidated joint venture, RL Venture. In 2018, nine of the RL Venture properties were sold for $116.5 million. In December 2019, we sold an additional RL Venture property for $33.0 million. In November 2019, we sold the only hotel in our consolidated joint venture, RLS Atla Venture for $12.3 million. Most of the buyers entered into franchise license agreements to retain the Red Lion brand. 
We operated six hotels as of December 31, 2019. These include one wholly owned hotel, two hotels owned or operated under a land lease through joint venture (JV) entities, and three hotels operated under land and/or property leases held directly by the Company. 
Our Baltimore Hotel RL became a wholly owned hotel in 2018. Previously, the hotel was held in its own JV entity, RLS Balt Venture, LLC, of which we owned 73%, until we purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in October 2018. 
As of December 31, 2019, our Hotel RL Olympia hotel is the only remaining property held in RL Venture, of which we own a 55% interest. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold the Hotel RL Salt Lake City, a property previously held in RL Venture.
Also as of December 31, 2019, our Washington DC Hotel RL is held in its own JV entity, RLS DC Venture, LLC, of which we own 55%. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold our Red Lion Hotel Atlanta Airport hotel. The property was previously held in its own JV entity, RLS Atla Venture, LLC, of which we own 55%. 
We have leasehold interests in our Anaheim, Seatac, and Kalispell hotel properties. These leases have expiration dates in 2021, 2024, and 2028, respectively. The Anaheim lease has 17 five-year renewal options remaining and the Kalispell lease has three five-year renewal options remaining.

Employees
At December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 285 people on a full-time or part-time basis. Our total number of employees fluctuates seasonally, primarily due to company operated hotel activity. At December 31, 2019, none of our total workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employee count has declined over time as we have disposed of a number of our company operated hotels and entered into third party management agreements for many of our remaining company operated hotels. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
