General
 
Advaxis, Inc. (“Advaxis” or the “Company”) is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary Lm-LLO cancer immunotherapies. These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (“Lm” or “Listeria” or “Lm TechnologyTM”) bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm-LLO strains are believed to be a significant advancement in immunotherapy as they integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy as they access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T-cell immunity, stimulate and activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants, and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T-cells to eliminate tumors.
 
Axalimogene filolisbac (“AXAL”) is our lead Lm-LLO immunotherapy product candidate for the treatment of Human Papilloma Virus (“HPV”) - associated cancers. The Company completed a randomized Phase 2 study in 110 patients with recurrent cervical cancer that was shown to have a manageable safety profile, apparent improved survival and objective tumor responses. In addition, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (“GOG”) Foundation, Inc., now part of NRG Oncology, conducted a cooperative group / Company sponsored Phase 2 open-label clinical study of AXAL in patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer with documented disease progression. The study, known as GOG-0265, has successfully completed the first and second stages in its Simon 2-stage design. The results from both stages combined demonstrate a 38% 12-month overall survival. Upon early closure of this study, a total of 50 patients were dosed resulting in a 12-month survival rate of 38.0% with a manageable safety profile. The Company has initiated a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for the adjuvant treatment of women with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer and is planning to initiate a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial in 2017 in the metastatic cervical cancer setting. The Company also plans to pursue registrational opportunities in Europe in 2017 for the metastatic cervical cancer.
 
AXAL has received United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) orphan drug designation for three HPV-associated cancers: cervical, head and neck, and anal cancer, and has received European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) orphan drug designation for anal cancer. AXAL has been designated by the FDA as a Fast Track product for adjuvant therapy for high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer patients. It has also been classified as an advanced-therapy medicinal product (“ATMP”) for the treatment of cervical cancer by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”). AXAL is subject to an agreement with the FDA, under the Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) process, for the Phase 3 AIM2CERV trial in patients with high-risk, locally advanced cervical cancer. It is also being evaluated in Company-sponsored trials executed under an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) which include the following: (i) a Phase 1/2 clinical trial alone and in combination with MedImmune, LLC’s (“MedImmune”) investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in patients with previously treated metastatic cervical cancer or patients with HPV-associated head and neck cancer; and (ii) a single arm Phase 2 monotherapy study in patients with metastatic anal cancer. In addition to the Company-sponsored trials, AXAL is also being evaluated in two investigator-initiated clinical trials as follows: neoadjuvant treatment of HPV-positive head and neck cancer (Mount Sinai & Baylor College of Medicine), and locally advanced high risk anal cancer (Brown University).
 
ADXS-PSA is the Company’s Lm-LLO immunotherapy product candidate designed to target the Prostate Specific Antigen (“PSA”) associated with prostate cancer which is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck & Co.’s (“Merck”) humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, in patients with previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
 
ADXS-HER2 is the Company’s Lm-LLO immunotherapy product candidate designed for the treatment of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (“HER2”) expressing cancers, including human and canine osteosarcoma. ADXS-HER2 is being evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with metastatic HER2 expressing solid tumors. The Company received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and EMA for ADXS-HER2 in osteosarcoma and have received Fast Track designation from the FDA for patients with newly-diagnosed, non-metastatic, surgically-resectable osteosarcoma. Clinical research with ADXS-HER2 in canine osteosarcoma is being developed by the Company’s pet therapeutic partner, Aratana Therapeutics Inc. (“Aratana”), who holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ADXS-HER2 and three other Lm -LLO immunotherapies for pet health applications. Aratana has announced that a product license application for use of ADXS-HER2 in the treatment of canine osteosarcoma has been filed with the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). Aratana received communication from the USDA in March 2015 stating that the previously submitted efficacy data for product licensure for AT-014 (ADXS-HER2), the cancer immunotherapy for canine osteosarcoma, was accepted and that it provides a reasonable expectation of efficacy that supports conditional licensure. While additional steps need to be completed, including in the areas of manufacturing and safety, Aratana anticipates that AT-014 could receive conditional licensure from the USDA in 2017.
 
In October of 2015, the Company received notification from the FDA that the INDs for AXAL were put on clinical hold in response to its submission of a safety report to the FDA. The clinical hold also included the INDs for ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2. Following discussions with the FDA and in accordance with their recommendations, the Company agreed to implement certain risk mitigation measures, including revised study protocol inclusion / exclusion criteria, post-administration antibiotic treatment and patient surveillance and monitoring measures. In December 2015, the FDA notified the Company that the hold had been lifted with respect to its INDs.

The Company has focused its development efforts on establishing a drug development pipeline that incorporates this technology into therapeutic cancer immunotherapies, with clinical trials currently targeting HPV-associated cancers (cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, and anal cancer), prostate cancer, and osteosarcoma. Although no immunotherapies have been commercialized to date, the Company continues to invest in research and development to advance the technology and make it available to patients with many different types of cancer. Pipeline development and the further exploration of the technology for advancement entails risk and expense. The Company anticipates that its ongoing operational costs will increase significantly as it continues conducting and expanding its clinical development programs. In addition to its existing single antigen vectors that target one tumor associated antigen, the Company is actively engaged in the development of new constructs that will address multiple targets that are common to tumor types, as well as mutation-associated epitopes that are specific to an individual patient’s tumor. The Company is also leveraging its Lm Technology™ to target common (public or shared) mutations (hotspots) in tumor driver genes. The Company is exploring a preclinical infectious disease program as well to examine potential applications of its Lm Technology™. Lastly, the Company is continuing to build-out its manufacturing capabilities at the state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Princeton, NJ, to produce supplies for its neoepitope and other development programs.
 
Clinical Pipeline
 
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary Lm-LLO immunotherapies with our lead program in Phase 3 development. These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm -LLO strains are believed to be a significant advancement in immunotherapy as they integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy as they access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T-cell immunity, stimulate and activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants, and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T-cells to eliminate tumors.
 
AXAL Franchise
 
AXAL is an Lm-LLO immunotherapy directed against HPV and designed to target cells expressing the HPV. It is currently under investigation in three HPV-associated cancers: cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, and anal cancer, either as a monotherapy or in combination.
 
Cervical Cancer
 
There are 527,624 new cases of cervical cancer caused by HPV worldwide every year, and 12,000 new cases in the U.S. alone, according to the WHO Human Papillomavirus and Related Cancers in the World Summary Report 2016 (“WHO”). Current preventative vaccines cannot protect all women who are infected with this very common virus. Challenges with acceptance, accessibility, and compliance have resulted in approximately a third of young women being vaccinated in the United States and even less in other countries around the world.
 
We completed a randomized Phase 2 clinical study (Lm-LLO-E7-15), conducted exclusively in India, in 110 women with recurrent/refractory cervical cancer. The final results were presented at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting, and showed that 32% (35/109) of patients were alive at 12 months, 22% (24/109) of patients were Long-term Survivors (“LTS”) alive greater than 18 months, and 18% (16/91) evaluable with adequate follow-up of patients were alive for more than 24 months. Of the 109 patients treated in the study, LTS included not only patients with tumor shrinkage but also patients who had experienced stable disease or increased tumor burden. 17% (19/109) of the patients in the trial had recurrence of disease after at least two prior treatments for their cervical cancer; these patients comprised 8% (2/24) of LTS. Among the LTS, 25% (3/12) of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2, a patient population that is often times excluded from clinical trials. Furthermore, a 10% objective response rate (including 5 complete responses and 6 partial responses) and a disease control rate of 38% (42/109) were observed. The addition of cisplatin chemotherapy to AXAL in this study did not significantly improve overall survival or objective tumor response (p =0.9981).
 
In this study, 109 patients received 254 doses of AXAL. AXAL was found to be well tolerated with 38% (41/109) of patients experiencing mild to moderate Grade 1 or 2 transient adverse events associated with infusion; 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 Serious Adverse Events (“SAE”). All observed treatment-related adverse events either self-resolved or responded readily to symptomatic treatment.
 
We have reached an agreement with the FDA, under the Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) process, for a Phase 3 trial evaluating AXAL in patients with high-risk, locally advanced cervical cancer (“AIM2CERV” or “Advaxis Immunotherapy 2 Prevent Cervical Recurrence”). In collaboration with the GOG/NRG Oncology, an independent international non-profit organization with the purpose of promoting excellence in the quality and integrity of clinical and basic scientific research in the field of gynecologic malignancies, we have initiated the AIM2CERV study to support a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submission in the U.S. and in other territories around the world.
 
AIM2CERV is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study of adjuvant AXAL, following primary chemoradiation treatment of women with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer (“HRLACC”). The primary objective of AIM2CERV is to compare the disease free survival of AXAL to placebo administered in the adjuvant setting following standard concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (“CCRT”) administered with curative intent to patients with HRLACC. Secondary endpoints include examining overall survival and safety. Our goal is to develop a treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of cervical cancer recurrence after primary, standard of care treatment in women who are at high risk of recurrence.

Biocon Limited (“Biocon”), our co-development and commercialization partner for AXAL in India and key emerging markets, filed a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for licensure of this immunotherapy in India. The Drug Controller General of India (“DCGI”) accepted this MAA for review. The filing of the MAA was driven by several factors: (i) results from the Lm -LLO-E7-15 Phase 2 trial indicated that AXAL was well tolerated and showed significant clinical activity in recurrent/refractory cervical cancer; (ii) cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women (according to WHO, there are 122,844 new cases per year with 67,544 deaths reported); and (iii) current treatment options for non-operable refractory/recurrent disease are limited in India. As part of the MAA review process, Biocon met with the Scientific Expert Committee (the “Committee”). The Committee indicated that proof of concept for this novel immunotherapy has been established. The Committee advised Biocon to obtain data from a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with recurrent cervical cancer who have failed prior chemo and radiation therapies. The face-to-face interaction with the Committee provided Biocon and Advaxis with valuable insight for future development and the companies are evaluating next steps.
 
We have a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, and are conducting a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two-part study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXAL, in combination with MedImmune’s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, as a combination treatment for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (“SCCHN”). For the AXAL and durvalumab dose escalation portion of the study, the dose-escalation phase has been completed. As reported at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) 2016 annual meeting, preliminary results from the dose escalation portion of the study showed that there were no dose limiting toxicities observed, and the safety profile was consistent with previous findings for both AXAL and durvalumab. The recommended phase 2 dose was established as 1x109 CFU for AXAL and 10 mg/kg for durvalumab. One patient with cervical cancer achieved a complete response, which remains ongoing after 12 months of follow-up and one patient, also with cervical cancer, achieved a partial response with subsequent disease progression. In addition, two patients with HNSCC achieved stable disease. Treatment related adverse events (“TRAE”) were reported in 91 percent of patients; the majority were either grade 1 or grade 2 events such as chills, fever, nausea and hypotension. Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in three patients, and one patient experienced a grade 4 event. We have commenced enrollment in the Part A (20 patients with SCCHN) and B (90 patients with cervical cancer) expansion phases. Accrual is ongoing.
 
The GOG Foundation, Inc. (now a member of NRG Oncology), under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (“CTEP”) of the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”), conducted GOG-0265, an open-label, single arm Phase 2 study of AXAL in persistent or recurrent cervical cancer (patients must have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of their recurrent/metastatic disease, not including that administered as a component of primary treatment) at numerous clinical sites in the U.S. The study was a Simon 2-stage design. The first stage of enrollment in GOG-0265 was successfully completed with 26 patients treated and met the predetermined safety and efficacy criteria required to proceed into the second stage of patient enrollment. Clinical data from the first stage of GOG-0265 was presented at the American Gynecological & Obstetrical Society (“AGOS”) annual meeting on September 17, 2015. Overall survival at 12 months was 38.5% (10/26) (the predefined criteria for 12-month survival in order to progress to Stage 2 was ≥20%), and, among patients who had received the full treatment regimen of 3 doses of AXAL, the 12-month survival rate was 55.6% (10/18). The adverse events observed in the first stage of the study have been consistent with those reported in other clinical studies with AXAL. It was well-tolerated, with Grade 1-2 fatigue, chills, and fever the most commonly reported Adverse Events (“AE”); six patients experienced a treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE, which was considered possibly-related to AXAL.
 
Stage 2 of the study began enrollment in February 2015 which included a protocol amendment to allow patients to continue to receive repeat cycles of therapy until disease progression. Stage 2 enrollment was temporarily suspended with the clinical hold in October 2015. Prior to re-initiating enrollment of a new cohort of Stage 2 patients, Advaxis and the GOG Foundation/NRG Oncology examined the 12-month survival and safety data obtained from the 24 patients who had previously enrolled in Stage 2. The Stage 2 population demonstrated that treatment with AXAL resulted in a 37.5% 12-month overall survival rate. This data was consistent with the findings in Stage 1 that showed a 38.5% 12-month survival, despite a greater proportion of Stage 2 patients having failed bevacizumab treatment. Taken together, the available data from both stages of GOG-0265 comprise a Phase 2 clinical trial with 50 subjects with a 12 month OS of 38%. Based on the GOG database and specific patient factors and eligibility criteria of the participants in this trial, the expected 12-month survival rate would have been 25%. Comparing this expected 25% 12-month overall survival rate to the observed actual 38% 12-month overall survival, treatment with AXAL resulted in a 52% increase in 12-month overall survival. In the second stage of the study, 15 out of 24 patients experienced a Grade 1 or Grade 2 TRAE associated with AXAL infusion. The most common Grade 1 or Grade 2 TRAEs were hypotension and symptoms related to cytokine release (e.g., nausea, chills, fever). Nine out of 24 patients experienced a Grade 3 TRAE and two out of 24 patients experienced a Grade 4 TRAE, which were hypotension and symptoms related to cytokine release.
 
In October 2016, upon review of these findings, the Company announced early closure of GOG-0265. Based on these data, the Company plans on pursuing regulatory opportunities for this unmet medical need in Europe in 2017, and is planning to initiate a Phase 3 registrational trial in 2017 in the metastatic cervical cancer setting.
 
AXAL has received FDA orphan drug designation for invasive FIGO Stage II-IV cervical cancer, and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer patients. AXAL has also been classified as an advanced-therapy medicinal product (“ATMP”) for the treatment of cervical cancer by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”). The CAT is the EMA’s committee responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs. The Company has commenced the CAT certification procedure and review of preclinical and CMC information is underway for potential inclusion in the Marketing Authorization Application.

 Head and Neck Cancer
 
SCCHN is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor of the head and neck and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. More than 90% of SCCHNs originate from the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx and 70% of these cancers are caused by HPV, with the incidence increasing every year. According to the American Cancer Society, head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the United States. Approximately 12,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United Stated in 2016 according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (“SEER”) database.
 
The safety and immunogenicity of AXAL is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study under an investigator-sponsored IND at Mount Sinai and Baylor College of Medicine in a pre-surgery “window of opportunity” trial in patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancer. This clinical trial is the first study to evaluate the immunologic and pathologic effects of AXAL in patients when they are initially diagnosed with HPV-associated head and neck cancer. The study is designed to show that AXAL is highly immunogenic and worth further investigation if the overall rate of vaccine-induced T-cell responses is 75 percent or more. Preliminary clinical data from this trial was presented at the American Association of Cancer Research (“AACR”) annual meeting on April 18, 2016. The data from eight of the nine patients enrolled in Stage 1 who were treated with AXAL confirmed that the study met the target for the overall rate of vaccine-induced T-cell response. The results demonstrated that, HPV E7- and/or E6-specific T cell responses increased in the peripheral blood in five of the study patients. Increased infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in the Tumor Immune Microenvironment (“TME”) of four patients, with a reduction of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells within the tumors of 3/6 patients. Increased T cell responses to HPV E6 supports enhanced immune activity against additional tumor targets. Changes to the TME included cytotoxic T cell infiltration into the post-resection tumor, increased immune activation, a reduction of regulatory T cells, infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and increased expression of inflammatory activation markers. In addition, fluctuations of circulating serum cytokine (IL-15, IL-9, TNFa, IL-2 and MIP-1b) levels were observed potentially suggesting consumption by activated T cells and migration of T cells to the TME. This study met its Stage 1 primary objective and is now advancing into the second stage of the clinical study. Stage 2 of the clinical study is currently accruing patients.
 
As stated above, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MedImmune to collaborate on a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two part study to evaluate safety and efficacy of AXAL, in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736), for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated SCCHN.
 
AXAL has received FDA orphan drug designation for HPV-associated head and neck cancer.
 
Anal Cancer
 
According to the American Cancer Society, nearly all squamous cell anal cancers are linked to infection by HPV, the same virus that causes cervical cancer. According to the SEER database, approximately 7,500 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016.
 
The safety and efficacy of AXAL is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study under an investigator-sponsored IND by Brown University in patients with high-risk locally advanced anal cancer. As of December 2016, all patients who have completed treatment experienced a six-month complete response (n=9), with no evidence of recurrence. Expected complete response rate at six-months is approximately 50% and the complete response rate in this study is 82% (9 out of 11 patients). The follow-up duration is six-months to 33 months. In consideration of these preliminary data, the investigator at Brown University is evaluating the opportunity to transition this study into a NCI-funded cooperative group trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AXAL in a pivotal Phase 2/3 anal cancer trial, to be conducted by NRG Oncology. In advance of the foregoing, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (“RTOG”) Foundation for the conduct of such study. Depending on the Company’s ability to agree upon the study design and budget, the Company plans to initiate a registrational study in high-risk locally advanced anal cancer.
 
We are conducting a Phase 2 multi-center, open-label, Simon two-stage study (“FAWCETT” or “Fighting Anal-Cancer with CTL Enhancing Tumor Therapy”), testing AXAL in patients with persistent or recurrent metastatic anal cancer. FAWCETT is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXAL as a monotherapy in patients with HPV-associated metastatic anal cancer who have received at least one prior treatment regimen for the advanced disease. Stage 1 of the trial will enroll 31 patients with anal cancer whose disease recurred after receiving treatment. Enrollment of Stage 2 will begin following the evaluation of Stage 1 and is targeting enrollment of 60 patients. Patients will receive AXAL 1x10 9 CFU doses every three weeks for up to two years.
 
AXAL has received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for anal cancer.
 
ADXS-PSA Franchise
 
Prostate Cancer
 
According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found in American men. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, behind only lung cancer. One man in seven will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and one man in 36 will die of this disease. About 180,890 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016 according to the SEER database and accounts for approximately 11% of all new cancer cases.
 
ADXS-PSA is an Lm -LLO immunotherapy designed to target the PSA antigen commonly overexpressed in prostate cancer.

We have entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck & Co. (“Merck”) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADXS-PSA as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti PD-1 antibody, in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study in patients with previously treated metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. For the ADXS-PSA monotherapy dose escalation portion of the study, cohorts were successfully escalated to higher dose levels of 5x109 CFU and 1x1010 CFU without achieving a maximum tolerated dose. Side effects noted at these higher dose levels were generally consistent with those observed at the lower dose level, other than a higher occurrence rate of predominantly Grade 2/3 hypotension. The Company believes it has gained a sufficient understanding of the safety profile of higher dose levels based on the results from this as well as other ongoing Advaxis studies. Additional patients at the 1x10 9 CFU dose level have been enrolled to complete the dose escalation phase of the study. After ensuring adequate safety of this dose in the prostate cancer patient population, the study has enrolled patients into the combination phase with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).
 
ADXS-HER2 Franchise
 
HER2 Expressing Solid Tumors
 
HER2 is overexpressed in a percentage of solid tumors including osteosarcoma. According to the SEER database and recent published literature, approximately 60-70% of osteosarcoma are HER2 positive, which is associated with poor outcomes for patients.
 
ADXS-HER2 is an Lm-LLO immunotherapy designed to target HER2 expressing solid tumors including human and canine osteosarcoma. The FDA has cleared our IND application and we have initiated a Phase 1b study in patients with metastatic HER2-expressing cancers. Thereafter, we intend to initiate a clinical development program with ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma.
 
Osteosarcoma
 
Osteosarcoma affects about 400 children and teens in the U.S. every year, representing a small but significant unmet medical need that has seen little therapeutic improvement in decades. Osteosarcoma is considered a rare disease and may qualify for regulatory incentives including, but not limited to, orphan drug designation, patent term extension, market exclusivity, and development grants. Given the limited availability of new treatment options for osteosarcoma, and that it is an unmet medical need affecting a very small number of patients in the U.S. annually, we believe that, subject to regulatory approval, the potential to be on the market may be accelerated.
 
Based on encouraging data discussed below from a veterinarian clinical study in which pet dogs with naturally occurring osteosarcoma were treated with ADXS-HER2, we intend to initiate a clinical development program with ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of human osteosarcoma. Both veterinary and human osteosarcoma specialists consider canine osteosarcoma to be the best model for human osteosarcoma.
 
ADXS-HER2 has received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for osteosarcoma and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for patients with newly-diagnosed, non-metastatic, surgically-resectable osteosarcoma.
 
Canine Osteosarcoma
 
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in dogs, accounting for roughly 85% of tumors on the canine skeleton. Approximately 10,000 dogs a year (predominately middle to older-aged dogs and larger breeds) are diagnosed with osteosarcoma in the United States. This cancer initially presents as lameness and oftentimes visible swelling on the leg. Current standard of care treatment is amputation immediately after diagnosis, followed by chemotherapy. Median survival time with standard of care is ten to twelve months. For dogs that cannot undergo amputation, palliative radiation and analgesics are frequently employed and median survival times range from three to five months.
 
Under the direction of Dr. Nicola Mason, the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine is conducting studies in companion dogs evaluating the safety and efficacy of ADXS-HER2 in the treatment of naturally occurring canine osteosarcoma. In the initial study, the primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ADXS-HER2. Secondary endpoints for the study were progression-free survival and overall survival. The findings of the Phase 1 clinical trial in dogs with osteosarcoma suggest that ADXS-HER2 is safe and well tolerated at doses up to 3.3 x 10 9 CFU with no evidence of significant cardiac, hematological, or other systemic toxicities. The study determined that ADXS-HER2 is able to delay or prevent metastatic disease and significantly prolong overall survival in dogs with osteosarcoma that had minimal residual disease following standard of care (amputation and follow-up chemotherapy). This work was recently published in the September 2016 issue of Clinical Cancer Research. Dogs receiving ADXS-HER2 following standard of care (n=18) had a progression free survival of 615 days and a median survival time of 956 days. These results compared favorably to a historical control group where the median survival time was 423 days. A second study conducted by Dr. Mason has evaluated the effects of combination palliative radiation with ADXS-HER2 on dogs with primary osteosarcoma who were unsuitable for amputation (n=15). Preliminary data was presented at the 2015 ACVIM Forum and showed that repeat doses of ADXS-HER2 administered after palliative radiation were well tolerated with no systemic or cardiac toxicity. In long-term follow-up, several dogs have experienced prolonged survival times ranging from 21 to 30 months.

On March 19, 2014, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement with Aratana Therapeutics Inc. (“Aratana”), where we granted Aratana an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, certain of our proprietary technology that enables Aratana to develop and commercialize animal health products that will be targeted for treatment of osteosarcoma and other cancer indications in animals. A product license request has been filed by Aratana for ADXS-HER2 (also known as AT-014 by Aratana) for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma with the USDA. Aratana received communication from the USDA in March 2015 stating that the previously submitted efficacy data for product licensure for AT-014 (ADXS-HER2), the cancer immunotherapy for canine osteosarcoma, was accepted and that it provides a reasonable expectation of efficacy that supports conditional licensure. While additional steps need to be completed, including in the areas of manufacturing and safety, Aratana anticipates that AT-014 could receive conditional licensure from the USDA in 2017. Aratana has been granted exclusive worldwide rights by us to develop and commercialize ADXS-HER2 in animals. Aratana is further responsible for the conduct of clinical research with ADXS-Survivin in canine/feline lymphoma, as well as pending investigations of two additional Advaxis constructs in animals.
 
ADXS-NEO Franchise (preclinical)
 
In August 2016, we entered into a global agreement (the “Agreement”) with Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) for the development and commercialization of ADXS-NEO, a novel, preclinical investigational cancer immunotherapy treatment, using our proprietary Lm Technology™ attenuated bacterial vector which activates a patient’s immune system to respond against multiple potential unique mutations, or neoepitopes, contained in and identified from an individual patient’s tumor through DNA sequencing.
 
In February 2016, we had a productive pre-IND meeting with the FDA. Following this meeting, we intend to file an IND application for ADXS-NEO in 2017 and to initiate Company-sponsored studies, as well as external collaborations, under a program entitled “MINE™” (My Immunotherapy Neo-Epitopes).
 
The goal of MINE™ is to use our Lm Technology™ to develop patient specific neo-epitope targeted immunotherapies based on mutations found in an individual patient’s tumor (“ADXS-NEO”). MINE™ will first focus on a preclinical study of our new construct approach to evaluate the immunologic effects and anti-tumor activity of a personalized immunotherapy in mouse tumor models. We will use learnings from the preclinical and non-clinical investigations to refine and develop patient specific immunotherapy construct treatments that incorporate the neoepitope sequences identified in the patient’s tumor cells through comparative DNA sequencing. Clinical studies using ADXS-NEO are in active development in collaboration with our partner, Amgen. Further, we have entered into various research collaboration, including the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, to advance the study of neoepitope-based, personalized cancer therapy.
 
ADXS-HOT Franchise (preclinical)
 
We are developing Lm-LLO constructs that could target common (public or shared) mutations in tumor driver genes. ADXS-HOT products may target acquired public mutations in tumor driver genes that are shared by multiple patients, and could have greater immunogenicity than the natural sequence peptides in normal cells. ADXS-HOT products are expected to be “off the shelf” and ready to administer for multiple patients. DNA sequencing is not required and presence of the hot-spot target can usually be determined by a rapid biomarker test. The ability to combine multiple constructs may increase coverage and the potential for clinical benefit.

AXAL and Durvalumab
 
As further described above, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MedImmune to conduct a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two part study to evaluate safety and efficacy of AXAL, in combination with MedImmune’s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (MEDI4736), as a combination treatment for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated SCCHN. For the AXAL and durvalumab dose escalation portion of the study, the dose-escalation cohort has been completed. We have commenced enrollment in the Part A (20 patients with SCCHN) and B (90 patients with cervical cancer) expansion phases. Accrual is ongoing.
 
ADXS-PSA and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)
 
As further described above, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADXS-PSA as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti PD-1 antibody, in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study in patients with previously treated metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. For the ADXS-PSA monotherapy dose escalation portion of the study, cohorts were successfully escalated to higher dose levels of 5x109 CFU and 1x1010 CFU without achieving a maximum tolerated dose. Side effects noted at these higher dose levels were generally consistent with those observed at the lower dose level, other than a higher occurrence rate of predominantly Grade 2/3 hypotension. The Company believes it has gained a sufficient understanding of the safety profile of higher dose levels based on the results from this as well as other ongoing Advaxis studies. Additional patients at the 1x10 9 CFU dose level were enrolled to complete the dose escalation phase of the study. After ensuring adequate safety of this dose in the prostate cancer patient population, the study has enrolled patients into the combination phase with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab).

Lm-LLO Immunotherapy (preclinical)
 
We are developing other ways to exploit the potential of our Lm Technology™ including, but not limited to, the use of Lm Technology™ in Infectious Disease. We have various preclinical collaborations with academic and other centers of excellence to explore the potential opportunities in this disease area. Preclinical data of detoxified Listeriolysin O (“dtLLO”) shows potential use as an immunologic adjuvant or carrier for vaccinations. We intend to continue to explore the potential of dtLLO as an adjuvant molecule in the development of vaccines for infectious diseases.


Corporate Information
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on June 5, 1987 under the name Great Expectations, Inc. We were a publicly-traded “shell” company without any business until November 12, 2004 when we acquired Advaxis, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, dated as of August 25, 2004, which we refer to as the Share Exchange, by and among Advaxis, the stockholders of Advaxis and us. As a result of the Share Exchange, Advaxis became our wholly-owned subsidiary and our sole operating company. On December 23, 2004, we amended and restated our articles of incorporation and changed our name to Advaxis, Inc. On June 6, 2006, our stockholders approved the reincorporation of our company from Colorado to Delaware by merging the Colorado entity into our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. Our date of inception, for financial statement purposes, is March 1, 2002 and the Company was uplisted to NASDAQ in 2014.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 305 College Road East, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 and our telephone number is (609) 452-9813. We maintain a corporate website at www.advaxis.com which contains descriptions of our technology, our product candidates and the development status of each drug. We make available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC.

 Intellectual Property
 
Protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. We have a robust and extensive patent portfolio that protects our product candidates and Lm-based immunotherapy technology. Currently, we own or have rights to approximately 246 patents and applications, which are owned, licensed from, or co-owned with Penn, Merck, NIH, and/or Augusta University. We continuously grow this portfolio by filing new applications to protect our ongoing research and development efforts. We aggressively prosecute and defend our patents and proprietary technology. Our patents and applications are directed to the compositions of matter, use, and methods thereof, of our Lm-LLO immunotherapies for our product candidates, including AXAL, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-HER2, ADXS-NEO, and ADXS-HOT.
 
Our approach to the intellectual property portfolio is to create, maintain, protect, enforce and defend our proprietary rights for the products we develop from our immunotherapy technology platform. We endeavor to maintain a coherent and aggressive strategic approach to building our patent portfolio with an emphasis in the field of cancer vaccines.
 
We successfully defended our intellectual property concerning our Lm-based technology by contesting a challenge made by Anza Therapeutics, Inc. (now known as Aduro BioTech), to our patent position in Europe on a claim not available in the United States. The European Patent Office (“EPO”) Board of Appeals in Munich, Germany ruled in favor of the Trustees of Penn and us, Penn’s exclusive licensee, and reversed a patent ruling that revoked a technology patent that had resulted from an opposition filed by Anza. The ruling of the EPO Board of Appeals is final and cannot be appealed. The granted claims, the subject matter of which was discovered by Dr. Yvonne Paterson, are directed to the method of preparation and composition of matter of recombinant bacteria expressing tumor antigens for the treatment of patients with cancer. The successful development of our immunotherapies will include our ability to create and maintain intellectual property related to our product candidates.
 
Issued patents which are directed to our product candidates AXAL, ADXS-PSA, and ADXS-HER2 in the United States, will expire between 2017 and 2032. Issued patents directed to our product candidates AXAL, ADXS-PSA, and ADXS-HER2 outside of the United States, will expire in 2032. Issued patents directed to our Lm-based immunotherapy platform in the United States, will expire between 2017 and 2031. Issued patents directed to our Lm-based immunotherapy platform outside of the United States, will expire between 2018 and 2033.
 
We have issued patents directed to methods of using our product candidates AXAL, ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2 in the United States, which will expire between 2017 and 2032. Issued patents directed to use of our product candidates: AXAL, ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2 for indications outside of the United States, will expire between 2018 and 2032.
 
We have pending patent applications directed to our product candidates AXAL, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-HER2, ADXS-NEO and ADXS-HOT that, if issued would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2020 and 2037. We have pending patent applications directed to methods of using of our product candidates AXAL, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-HER2, ADXS-NEO and ADXS-HOT directed to the following indications and others: her2/neu-expressing cancer, prostate cancer, cervical dysplasia, and cervical cancer that, if issued would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2020 and 2037, depending on the specific indications.
 
We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
Any patent applications which we have filed or will file or to which we have or will have license rights may not issue, and patents that do issue may not contain commercially valuable claims. In addition, any patents issued to us or our licensors may not afford meaningful protection for our products or technology, or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated, narrowed, or found unenforceable. Our processes and potential products may also conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, academic institutions or others. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to interferences filed by others in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or to claims of patent infringement by other companies, institutions or individuals. These entities or persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the related product or process. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the relevant product or process. We may not prevail in any such action and any license required under any such patent may not be made available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to successfully defend a patent challenge or to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our technologies or potential products could have a materially adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.
 
 11

 
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, and in the future may determine in some cases that our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements rather than patents or licenses. We may not be able to protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology and others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies. If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary rights to our processes or products after obtaining regulatory clearance, competitors may be able to market competing processes and products.
 
Others may obtain patents having claims which cover aspects of our products or processes which are necessary for, or useful to, the development, use or manufacture of our services or products. Should any other group obtain patent protection with respect to our discoveries, our commercialization of potential therapeutic products and methods could be limited or prohibited.
 
The Drug Development Process
 
The product candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes multiple phases of clinical trials in which we collect data that will ultimately support an application to regulatory authorities to allow us to market a product for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a specified disease. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products, resulting in both high costs and a high rate of failure. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes many years and significant costs.
 
Clinical testing, known as clinical trials or clinical studies, is either conducted internally by pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or is managed on behalf of these companies by Clinical Research Organizations (“CRO”). The process of conducting clinical studies is highly regulated by the FDA, as well as by other governmental and professional bodies. In a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions according to the research plan or protocol created by the study sponsor and implemented by study investigators. Clinical trials may compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available or to a placebo that contains no active ingredients or to no intervention. Some clinical trials compare interventions that are already available to each other. When a new product or approach is being studied, it is not usually known whether it will be helpful, harmful, or no different than available alternatives. The investigators try to determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention by measuring certain clinical outcomes in the participants.
 
Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies allow initiation of clinical investigation of a new drug or product candidate. They typically involve testing an investigational new drug on a limited number of patients. Phase 1 studies determine a drug’s basic safety, maximum tolerated dose and how the drug is absorbed by, and eliminated from, the body. Typically, cancer therapies are initially tested on late-stage cancer patients.
 
Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials involve larger numbers of patients that have been diagnosed with the targeted disease or condition. Phase 2 clinical trials gather preliminary data on effectiveness (where the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. If Phase 2 clinical trials show that an investigational new drug has an acceptable range of safety risks and probable effectiveness, a company will continue to evaluate the investigational new drug in Phase 3 studies.
 
Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically controlled multi-center trials that involve a larger number of patients to ensure the study results are statistically significant. The purpose is to confirm effectiveness and safety on a large scale and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. These trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate clinical data necessary to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory agencies.
 
Biologic License Application (BLA). The results of the clinical trials using biologics are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA. Following the completion of Phase 3 studies, if the Sponsor of a potential product in the United States believes it has sufficient information to support the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug, the Sponsor submits a BLA to the FDA requesting that the investigational new drug be approved for marketing. The application is a comprehensive, multi-volume filing that includes the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about the drug’s composition, and the Sponsor’s plans for manufacturing, packaging, labeling and testing the investigational new drug. The FDA’s review of an application is designated either as a standard review with a target review time of 10 months or a priority review with a target of 6 months. Depending upon the completeness of the application and the number and complexity of follow-up requests and responses between the FDA and the Sponsor, the review time can take months to many years. Once approved through this process, a drug may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA and post-approval studies may be required.
 
Government Regulations
 
General
 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of biologic products. In the United States, the FDA subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations.

 Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act (“ODA”), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which means a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States will be recovered from domestic sales of the product.
 
The benefits of ODD can be substantial, including research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees, enhanced access to advice from the FDA while the drug is being developed, and market exclusivity once the product reaches approval and begins sales, provided that the new product is first to market and that this new product has not been previously approved for the same orphan disease or condition, with or without orphan drug designation. In order to qualify for these incentives, a company must apply for designation of its product as an “Orphan Drug” and obtain approval from the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process; however, an ODD product may be eligible for priority review. A drug that is approved for the ODD indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.
 
We currently have ODD with the FDA for AXAL for treatment of anal cancer (granted August 2013), HPV-associated head and neck cancer (granted November 2013); and treatment of Stage II-IV invasive cervical cancer (granted May 2014). We also have ODD with the FDA for ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of osteosarcoma (granted May 2014).
 
In Europe, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) issued a positive opinion on the application for ODD of AXAL for the treatment of anal cancer (December 2015) and on the application for ODD of ADXS-HER2 for osteosarcoma (November 2015).
 
Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions
 
Four FDA programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation. We intend to avail ourselves of any and all of these programs as applicable to our products.
 
Non-U.S. Regulation
 
Before our products can be marketed outside the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval, and in certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
 
Collaborations, Partnerships and Agreements
 
Amgen
 
On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into a global agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen for the development and commercialization of the Company’s ADXS-NEO, a novel, preclinical investigational immunotherapy, using the Company’s proprietary Listeria monocytogenes attenuated bacterial vector which activates a patient’s immune system to respond against unique mutations, or neoepitopes, contained in and identified from an individual patient’s tumor. Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, Amgen receives an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize ADXS-NEO. Amgen made an upfront payment to Advaxis of $40 million and purchased $25 million of Advaxis common stock. Advaxis and Amgen will collaborate through a joint steering committee for the development and commercialization of ADXS-NEO. Under the Amgen Agreement, Amgen will fund the clinical development and commercialization of ADXS-NEO and Advaxis will retain manufacturing responsibilities. Advaxis will also receive development, regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $475 million and high single digit to double digit royalty payments based on worldwide sales.
 
In connection with the Amgen Agreement, Amgen purchased directly from Advaxis 3,047,446 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at approximately $8.20 per share (representing a purchase at market using a 20 day VWAP methodology). The gross proceeds to Advaxis from the sale of the shares was $25 million.

Especificos Stendhal SA de CV
 
On February 3, 2016, the Company entered into a Co-Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Stendhal Agreement”) with Especificos Stendhal SA de CV (“Stendhal”), for Advaxis’ lead Lm Technology™ immunotherapy, AXAL, in HPV-associated cancers. Under the terms of the Stendhal Agreement, Stendhal will pay $10 million towards the expense of AIM2CERV. This payment will be made over the duration of the trial. Stendhal will also work with the Company to complete the clinical trial of AXAL in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and other investigational sites in Latin American countries. Stendhal will manage and is responsible for the costs associated with the regulatory approval process, promotion, commercialization and market access for AXAL in these markets. Upon approval and commercialization of AXAL, Advaxis and Stendhal will share profits on a pre-determined basis.
 
Biocon Limited
 
On January 20, 2014, we entered into a Distribution and Supply Agreement (“Biocon Agreement”) with Biocon Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of India.
 
Pursuant to the Biocon Agreement, we granted Biocon an exclusive license (with a right to sublicense) to (i) use our data from clinical development activities, regulatory filings, technical, manufacturing and other information and know-how to enable Biocon to submit regulatory filings for AXAL in the following territories: India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Armenia, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen (collectively, the “Territory”) and (ii) import, promote, market, distribute and sell pharmaceutical products containing AXAL . AXAL is based on a novel platform technology using live, attenuated bacteria that are bio-engineered to secrete an antigen/adjuvant fusion protein(s) that is designed to redirect the powerful immune response all human beings have to the bacterium against their cancer.
 
We will have the exclusive right to supply AXAL to Biocon and Biocon will be required to purchase its requirements of AXAL exclusively from us at the specified contract price, as such price may be adjusted from time to time. The supply price agreed upon between the parties will be correlated to the net sales of the product during the preceding contract year. In addition, we will be entitled to a six-figure milestone payment if net sales of AXAL for the contract year following the initiation of clinical trials in India exceed certain specified thresholds.
 
Biocon will also have a right of first refusal relating to the licensing of any new products in the Territory that we may develop during the term of the Biocon Agreement.
 
The term of the Biocon Agreement will be the later of twenty years or the last to expire patent or patent application. In addition, the Biocon Agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty days’ written notice (i) in the event of a material breach by the other party of its obligations under the Biocon Agreement, (ii) if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent or (iii) if the other party undergoes a change in control.
 
Biocon filed a MAA for licensure of this immunotherapy in India. The DCGI accepted this MAA for review. The filing of the MAA was driven by several factors: i) results from the Lm-LLO-E7-15 Phase 2 trial indicated that AXAL was well tolerated and showed significant clinical activity in recurrent/refractory cervical cancer; ii) cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women (according to WHO, there are 122,844 new cases per year with 67,544 deaths reported); and iii) current treatment options for non-operable refractory/recurrent disease are limited in India. As part of the MAA review process, Biocon met with the Scientific Expert Committee (the “Committee”). The Committee indicated that proof of concept for this novel immunotherapy has been established. The Committee advised Biocon to obtain data from a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with recurrent cervical cancer who have failed prior chemo and radiation therapies. The face-to-face interaction with the Committee provided Biocon and Advaxis with valuable insight for future development.
 
Global BioPharma, Inc.
 
On December 9, 2013, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of AXAL with Global BioPharma, Inc. (“GBP”), a Taiwanese based biotech company funded by a group of investors led by Taiwan Biotech Co., Ltd (TBC).
 
GBP is planning to conduct a randomized Phase 2, open-label, controlled study in HPV-associated NSCLC in patients following first-line induction chemotherapy. GBP has obtained Taiwanese regulatory approval for this study and plans to initiate this study in 2017. This trial will be fully funded exclusively by GBP. GBP will continue to explore the use of our lead product candidate in several other indications including head and neck, and anal cancer. GBP also plans to conduct registration trials with AXAL for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer.
 
GBP will pay us event-based financial milestones, an annual development fee, and annual net sales royalty payments in the high single to double digits. In addition, as an upfront payment, GBP made an investment in us by purchasing shares of our Common Stock (“Common Stock”) at market price. GBP has an option to purchase additional shares of our stock at a 150% premium to the stock price on the effective date of the agreement.
 
 14

 
GBP will be responsible for all clinical development and commercialization costs in the GBP territory. GBP will also reimburse us $2.25 million toward AIM2CERV. GBP is committed to establishing manufacturing capabilities for its own. Under the terms of the agreement, we will exclusively license the rights of AXAL to GBP for the Asia, Africa, and former USSR territory, exclusive of India and certain other countries, for all HPV-associated indications. We will retain exclusive rights to AXAL for the rest of the world.
 
University of Pennsylvania
 
On July 1, 2002 we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Penn with respect to the innovative work of Yvonne Paterson, Ph.D., Associate Dean for Research at the School of Nursing at Penn, and former Professor of Microbiology at Penn, in the area of innate immunity, or the immune response attributed to immune cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells, that respond to pathogens non-specifically (subject to certain U.S. government rights). This agreement was amended and restated as of February 13, 2007, and, thereafter, has been amended from time to time.
 
This license, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, terminates upon the latter of (a) the expiration of the last to expire of the Penn patent rights; or (b) twenty years after the effective date of the license. Penn may terminate the license agreement early upon the occurrence of certain defaults by us, including, but not limited to, a material breach by us of the Penn license agreement that is not cured within 60 days after notice of the breach is provided to us.
 
The license provides us with the exclusive commercial rights to the patent portfolio developed by Penn as of the effective date of the license, in connection with Dr. Paterson and requires us to pay various milestone, legal, filing and licensing payments to commercialize the technology. In exchange for the license, Penn received shares of our Common Stock. However, as of October 31, 2016, Penn does not own shares of our Common Stock. In addition, Penn is entitled to receive a non-refundable initial license fee, royalty payments and milestone payments based on net sales and percentages of sublicense fees and certain commercial milestones. Under the amended licensing agreement, Penn is entitled to receive 2.5% of net sales in the territory. Should annual net sales exceed $250 million, the royalty rate will increase to 2.75%, but only with respect to those annual net sales in excess of $250 million. Additionally, Penn will receive tiered sales milestone payments upon the achievement of cumulative global sales ranging between $250 million and $2 billion, with the maximum aggregate amounts payable to Penn in the event that maximum sales milestones are achieved is $40 million. Notwithstanding these royalty rates, upon first in-human commercial sale (U.S. & E.U.), we have agreed to pay Penn a total of $775,000 over a four-year period as an advance minimum royalty, which shall serve as an advance royalty in conjunction with the above terms. In addition, under the license, we are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 commencing on December 31, 2010, and each December 31st thereafter for the remainder of the term of the agreement until the first commercial sale of a Penn licensed product. We are responsible for filing new patents and maintaining and defending the existing patents licensed to us and we are obligated to reimburse Penn for all attorney’s fees, expenses, official fees and other charges incurred in the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of the patents licensed from Penn.
 
Upon first regulatory approval in humans (US or EU), Penn will be entitled to a milestone payment of $600,000. Furthermore, upon the achievement of the first sale of a product in certain fields, Penn will be entitled to certain milestone payments, as follows: $2.5 million will be due upon the first in-human commercial sale (US or EU) of the first product in the cancer field and $1.0 million will be due upon the date of first in-human commercial sale (US or EU) of a product in each of the secondary strategic fields sold.
 
As of October 31, 2016, we had no outstanding balance with Penn under all licensing agreements.
 
Merck & Co., Inc.
 
On August 22, 2014, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the “Merck Agreement”) with Merck, pursuant to which the parties will collaborate on a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and safety study. The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the safety of our Lm -LLO based immunotherapy for prostate cancer, ADXS31-142 (the “Advaxis Compound”) as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1 (the “Merck Compound”), to determine a recommended Phase 2 combination dose. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Advaxis Compound in combination with the Merck Compound. Both phases of the study will be in patients with previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. A joint development committee, comprised of equal representatives from both parties, is responsible for coordinating all regulatory and other activities under, and pursuant to, the Merck Agreement.
 
Each party is responsible for their own internal costs and expenses to support the study, while we will be responsible for all third party costs of conducting the study. Merck will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Merck Compound. We will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Advaxis Compound. We will be the sponsor of the study and hold the IND related to the study.
 
All data and results generated under the study (“Collaboration Data”) will be jointly owned by the parties, except that ownership of data and information generated from sample analysis to be performed by each party on its respective compound will be owned by the party conducting such testing. All rights to all inventions and discoveries, which claim or cover the combined use of the Advaxis Compound and the Merck Compound shall belong jointly to the parties. Inventions and discoveries relating solely to the Advaxis Compound, or a live attenuated bacterial vaccine, shall be the exclusive property of us. Inventions and discoveries relating solely to the Merck Compound, or a PD-1 antagonist, shall be the exclusive property of Merck.
 
 15

 
The Merck Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until completion of all of the obligations of the parties or a permitted termination.
 
MedImmune/AstraZeneca
 
On July 21, 2014, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (the “MedImmune Agreement”) with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, pursuant to which the parties intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MedImmune’s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, MEDI4736, in combination with our investigational Lm -LLO cancer immunotherapy, AXAL , as a combination treatment for patients with advanced, recurrent or refractory cervical cancer and HPV-associated head and neck cancer. A joint steering committee, composed of equal representatives from both parties, is responsible for various matters associated with the collaboration, including protocol approval, as well as reviewing and monitoring the progress of the study.
 
MedImmune will be responsible for providing MEDI4736 at no cost, as well as costs related to the proprietary assays performed by MedImmune or a third party on behalf of MedImmune. We will be the sponsor of the study and be responsible for the submission of all regulatory filings to support the study, the negotiation and execution of the clinical trial agreements associated with each study site, and the packaging and labelling of the Advaxis and MedImmune product candidates to be used in the study and the costs associated therewith.
 
For a period beginning upon the completion of the study and the receipt by MedImmune of the last final report for the study and ending one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter (unless extended), MedImmune will be granted negotiate negotiation period in an attempt to enter into an agreement with Advaxis with respect to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of AXAL and MEDI4736 to be used in combination with each other for the treatment or prevention of cancer. Neither party is obligated to enter into such an agreement. In the event the parties do not enter an agreement and we obtain regulatory approval for AXAL in combination with any PD-1 antibody or PD-L1 antibody, we shall pay MedImmune a royalty obligation and one-time payment.

Aratana
 
On March 19, 2014, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement (the “Aratana Agreement”) with Aratana. Pursuant to the Aratana Agreement, we granted Aratana an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under certain Advaxis proprietary technology that enables the design of an immunotherapy utilizing live attenuated Lm bioengineered to secrete fusion proteins consisting of antigen and adjuvant molecules, including certain “Constructs” and related “Compounds” (both as defined in the Aratana Agreement) in order for Aratana to develop and commercialize animal health products containing or incorporating Compounds (“Products”) for use in non-human animal health applications (the “Aratana Field”) that will be targeted for treatment of osteosarcoma and other cancer indications in animals. Our technology licensed to Aratana includes certain patents and patent applications, as well as related know-how, data, technical information, results and other information controlled by us during the term of the Aratana Agreement that are reasonably necessary for the development, manufacture or commercialization of any Construct, Compound or Product.
 
In addition to the Constructs licensed by Aratana upon signing of the Aratana Agreement, Aratana also has a right of first refusal to license additional constructs from us in the future if we develop (on its own or upon request of Aratana) new constructs which are reasonably believed to be suitable for treating osteosarcoma and certain other cancer indications (“Additional Constructs”). If the parties agree upon the terms pursuant to which such Additional Constructs shall be added as Constructs under the Aratana Agreement, such Additional Constructs will be added by virtue of an amendment to the Aratana Agreement.

Aratana has granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable and perpetual license, with the right to sublicense, under Aratana’s existing technology, and any related sole Aratana development or Aratana’s rights in any joint inventions which may be developed by the parties during the course of the Aratana Agreement, solely for us to develop and commercialize our products for any and all uses outside of the Aratana Field, including, without limitation, all human health applications. The Aratana technology to be licensed to us will include any patents or patent applications controlled by Aratana during the term of the Aratana Agreement that claim or cover the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of any Products as well as related know-how, data, technical information, results and other information controlled by Aratana during the term of the Aratana Agreement that is necessary or useful in the development, manufacture or commercialization of any Compound, Construct or Product.
 
Under the terms of the Aratana Agreement, Aratana paid an upfront payment to us in the amount of $1,000,000 upon signing of the Aratana Agreement. Aratana will also pay us (a) up to $36.5 million based on the achievement of milestone relating to the advancement of Products through the approval process with the USDA in the United States and the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union (“E.U.”) in all four therapeutic areas and up to an additional $15 million in cumulative sales milestones based on achievement of gross sales revenue targets for sales of any and all Products in the Aratana Field (regardless of therapeutic area), and (b) tiered royalties starting at 5% and going up to 10%, which will be paid based on net sales of any and all Products (regardless of therapeutic area) in the Aratana Field in the United States. Royalties for sales of Products outside of the United States will be paid at a rate equal to half of the royalty rate payable by Aratana on net sales of Products in the United States (starting at 2.5% and going up to 5%). Royalties will be payable on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis from first commercial sale of a Product in a country until the later of (a) the 10th anniversary of first commercial sale of such Product by Aratana, its affiliates or sub licensees in such country or (b) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of our patents or joint patents claiming or covering the composition of matter, formulation or method of use of such Product in such country. Aratana will also pay us 50% of all sublicense royalties received by Aratana and its affiliates.
 
Furthermore, pursuant to the Aratana Agreement, we (i) issued and sold 306,122 shares of Common Stock to Aratana at a price of $4.90 per share, which was equal to the closing price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 19, 2014, and (ii) issued a ten-year warrant to Aratana giving Aratana the right to purchase up to 153,061 additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.90 per share. The warrant also contains a provision for cashless exercise if the fair market value of Advaxis’ Common Stock for the five trading days ending three trading days prior to the exercise date is higher than the exercise price. In connection with the sale of the Common Stock and warrants, we received aggregate net proceeds of $1,500,000. We issued the shares and warrant in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Aratana has filed a product license request for ADXS-HER2 (also known as AT-014 by Aratana) for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma with the USDA. Aratana received communication from the USDA in March 2015 stating that the previously submitted efficacy data for product licensure for AT-014, the cancer immunotherapy for canine osteosarcoma, was accepted and that it provides a reasonable expectation of efficacy that supports conditional licensure. While additional steps need to be completed, including in the areas of manufacturing and safety, Aratana anticipates that AT-014 could receive conditional licensure from the USDA in 2017.
 
Master Services Agreement with inVentiv Health Clinical
 
On May 29, 2014, we announced that we entered into a master services agreement with inVentiv Health Clinical (“inVentiv”), a leading global Clinical Research Organization (“CRO”), for the clinical development of certain immunotherapy product candidates in our proprietary pipeline.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, inVentiv can provide us with full CRO services to execute clinical studies for our current cancer immunotherapy product candidates including AXAL for cervical cancer, and other HPV-associated cancer; ADXS-HER2 for pediatric osteosarcoma and ADXS-PSA for prostate cancer. In addition, pending regulatory approval, we can leverage inVentiv’s significant commercialization capabilities in select countries, should we seek to do so.
 
Agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc.
 
On August 26, 2015, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc. (“Knight”), a Canadian-based specialty pharmaceutical company, to commercialize in Canada Advaxis’ product candidates.
 
In connection with the agreement, Knight purchased 359,454 shares of our common stock at $13.91 per share, which represents a seven percent premium to the price of our common stock at market close on August 25, 2015. In addition, Sectoral Asset Management, a leading Canadian-based global healthcare investment advisor, purchased 1,437,815 shares at $13.91 per share directly from us on behalf of its clients. The combined gross proceeds to us from these direct investments was $25 million.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Knight will be responsible to conduct and fund all regulatory and commercial activities in Canada. We are eligible to receive double digit royalty as well as approximately $33 million in cumulative sales milestones.
 
Manufacturing
 
Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) are the standards identified in order to conform to requirements by governmental agencies that control authorization and licensure for manufacture and distribution of drug products for either clinical investigations or commercial sale. GMPs identify the requirements for procurement, manufacturing, testing, storage, distribution and the supporting quality systems in order to ensure that a drug product is safe for its intended application. cGMPs are enforced in the United States by the FDA, under the authorities of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and use the phrase “current good manufacturing practices” (“cGMP”) to describe these standards.

We have entered into agreements with multiple third-party organizations to handle the manufacturing, testing, and distribution of our product candidates. These organizations have extensive experience within the biologics space and with the production of clinical and commercial GMP supplies. In parallel, we have also continued to invest in our internal process/analytical development, quality systems, manufacturing, and quality control infrastructure with the goal of accelerating and advancing our pipeline. We have constructed a manufacturing plant capable of producing early phase clinical trial GMP supplies and capable of supporting process optimization/scale-up at our New Jersey headquarter and further build-out of the space remains underway to allow us to produce supplies for our neoepitope and our other programs. Our strategy is to continue to leverage both our partner’s capabilities and our internal capabilities in order to build a supply chain that is reliable, flexible, and cost competitive.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. As a result, our actual or proposed immunotherapies could become obsolete before we recoup any portion of our related research and development expenses. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and this competition comes from both biotechnology firms and from major pharmaceutical companies, including: Aduro Biotech, Agenus Inc., Celldex Therapeutics, Inovio Pharmaceutical Inc., ISA Pharmaceuticals, MedImmune LLC, Neon Therapeutics, Oncolytics Biotech Inc., Oncothyreon Inc., et al., each of which is pursuing cancer vaccines and/or immunotherapies.
 
Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products). We also experience competition in the development of our immunotherapies from universities and other research institutions and compete with others in acquiring technology from such universities and institutions. In addition, certain of our immunotherapies may be subject to competition from investigational new drugs and/or products developed using other technologies, some of which have completed numerous clinical trials.
 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential immunotherapies or of competitors’ products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop immunotherapies, complete preclinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, administration, reliability, acceptance, availability, price and patent position.
 
Experience and Expertise
 
Our management team has extensive experience in oncology development, including contract research, development, manufacturing and commercialization across a board range of science, technologies, and process operations. We have built internal capabilities supporting research, clinical, medical, manufacturing and compliance operations and have extended our expertise with collaborations.
